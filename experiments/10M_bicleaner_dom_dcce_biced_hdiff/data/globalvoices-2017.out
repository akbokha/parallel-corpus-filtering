although I visited the USA for at least once a year since 2012 , I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love to America is extraordinary .
as many of my generation I grew up with American movies , I danced American music and operated American writers and operated for his sport .
in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I was mainly inspired by an American film .
when I was 14 years old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gray Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican Letter , a fear@@ less rep@@ orter who was with the help of Julia Roberts as a Jura @-@ Student , who had inc@@ lined the Supreme Court with judges who had inc@@ lined his interest .
I was prisoner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Method Man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was like that the absolute truth is , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona had only intensi@@ fied my admir@@ ation for the US .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I always said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; America is the only country where I have ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting you can always be that you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of equal people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I had even written a very warm love letter about his size .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
a lot was written about the x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most unusual aspect of its asc@@ ension is for me , as he goes with his bott@@ die .
he never stops behind the mountain , as you say so beautiful .
he says exactly what he thinks , as a former colleague expressed it , and publicly declar@@ es his contemp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro@@ American and women .
nevertheless , people have responded to his testimony and tuned in dro@@ ves for him .
the 13 million votes he won with rep@@ ubli@@ can elections , was the highest number obtained by the nom@@ inees of the party .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans , who support this big@@ al person , I asked myself ?
I could not line Tr@@ ump and his voters in line with the people I had met in Phoenix during my time .
for example , my Professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , Director of the Journ@@ alism Program , the People from all over the World , a deep @-@ believing man , with whom I could talk about Islam and his past .
also , Tr@@ um@@ ps would not agree with Peter Bh@@ atia , the present editor of the &quot; Cincinnati In@@ quir@@ er , &quot; agreed .
Bh@@ atia and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours in order to watch the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; in the game .
Tr@@ um@@ ps In@@ tolerance is also about the contrast to gener@@ osity that I experienced at Sandy B@@ ahr , who fought for her life long the environment , and her husband Dave , my host family that treated me like her son .
yet it fits to the engagement of Krist@@ i K@@ app@@ es , who always helped with much patience and grace to me and my colleagues helped us to acc@@ ust@@ om the complexity of the American life .
then Andrew Lec@@ co , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise Council helped me a lot in my career .
these people and those affected by them are deep@@ ened my love in America .
while Tr@@ ump came to nom@@ inate his way to the nominated rep@@ ubli@@ can presidential candidate , they offered me a stop and the equivalent of his limited vision of America .
however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule .
on November 8 , 2016 over 50 million Americans , mostly White , the Presi@@ dency of a man , despite - or maybe due to his contemp@@ t towards non @-@ white men .
confron@@ ting with the idea that people voted for tr@@ ump , because they either shared his rac@@ ism and fan@@ at@@ ism , because they were ready to over@@ see these things , almost the heart broke my heart .
maybe it is un@@ fair to call the Tr@@ ump voters as a shave .
to arrange the people , one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is superf@@ icial and respec@@ tful and imp@@ lies an in@@ ability to understand those who act in a different way and think . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it shows the people that their wor@@ ries and fears are not taken into account regarding the hec@@ tic changes in their communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could it be that those voters have voted for tr@@ ump , because they want to reg@@ ain control over a country they are disappointed ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in other words , they would perhaps want to say that they are still important in this America ?
maybe . perhaps .
however , you can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick who comments the cruel decision to raise a man who look down with contemp@@ t for those who look differently than he .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( An@@ m . Ü . : as much as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; white against all other eth@@ nic@@ ities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ; word game from white in play on the wh@@ ites and whi@@ pl@@ ash , which means that great Van Jones has been killed exactly what America has made so great . &quot; &quot; &quot;
millions of people around the world appreciated the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality , it is still a powerful idea - what faith or background you may always have , America welcomes everyone .
because this country chose as its President , twice the son of a Ken@@ yan , its history , as he says himself , nowhere else in the world would be possible .
however , with the election of Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps , there is a huge portion of the White America promise , saying : hell with diversity , religious freedom and the whole term of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in the America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the Ru@@ der , they say .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq and what he said on the eve of election . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at a rally for Hillary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a change of vocab@@ ulary with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , had my son , captain Hum@@ ay@@ un K@@ ahn , had a place in your America ? &quot; he asked Mr. Khan .
the crowd answered with a loud &quot; no ! &quot;
&quot; could Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; the crowd had ro@@ ared .
&quot; have Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
have A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they cried and their voices were lou@@ der .
&quot; could anyone , who doesn &apos;t like you , a place in your America ? &quot;
he received a vocal and vocal &quot; NO . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , is not your America . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 36 hours later he was rep@@ lic@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the land , for which his son was fallen , sent him a message .
that is now Tr@@ um@@ ps Country , said the message .
and all the people that look like Mr. Khan , could no longer find space in this new America .
and that breaks me my heart .

out of the mis@@ ery of the stars : these Latin American children do not aband@@ on their love for music .
the &quot; Recy@@ cled Instruments Orchestra &quot; by C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay , during a concert in Washington DC .

what has the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero congregation in the Province of O@@ ax@@ aca , with the children of the Paraguay city C@@ ate@@ ura in common ?
that the music that is played on both places is not only changed the life of children , but also a very close connection with ...
music , who lives with the waste
Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump , only 16 Kilom@@ eters south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial town that is very popular among tourists - but worlds from the nearby magnificent ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine .
for a few years now the La B@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( musical ban@@ de ) in the village : a symph@@ ony orchestra which has a possibility of over@@ coming poverty has been found with their musical instruments .
a music school with 100 students has become the central interest for the municipality of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the community located in one of Mexico &apos;s p@@ oo@@ rest provinces , is known for its drug abuse and ban@@ den violence .
but this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot , who started a musical project and the youth had a rare hope of hope .
the young band members take their commit@@ ments to the music group very seriously , the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI comments :
as soon as they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to follow their big passion .
they always come and with shiny eyes and play with shiny eyes and play day for day trumpet , trombone , pic@@ colo , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , forest horn , tim@@ bre@@ ach , Bon@@ gos and the con@@ ga to play .
music from garbage
more than 7.000 kilometers south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero are the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village that lies practically on the largest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ on in Paraguay , on instruments which are made from recycled waste material :
music with re@@ prepared instruments , which consist of local solid waste materials , produced in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where the recy@@ c@@ ers have begun to transform pieces of waste in instruments .
the instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viola , c@@ elli , double b@@ asses , guitar , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tromb@@ ones and percussion that were all produced from garbage .
the repertoire comprises classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ish and Latin American music and music of the Beatles , by Frank Sin@@ atra etc .
in an article of the Los Angeles Times F@@ avi@@ o Chávez , a local ec@@ ologist and musical instructor of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , at the beginning time :
first it was very difficult because we had no place for rehear@@ s@@ als and we had to teach in the same place where the children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them do not live with their children .
that changed as F@@ avi@@ o a little bit showed what he had never seen before : a violin made out of waste .
today , there is an entire orchestra which plays on instruments from re@@ prepared material and called The Recy@@ cled Orchestra .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a documentation called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic garbage dump ) shows the musical performance : &quot; &quot; &quot;
every year , the world generates about one billion tons of tr@@ ash .
those who live with him and live by him are the sleeves - like people in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they turn it into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with his inspiring spectac@@ le from rub@@ b@@ ish @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra has even played his music before Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team@@ work can successfully fight illegal fishing
photo © F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that fights wild illegal fishing .
this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that focused on international , pract@@ ised solutions for environmental problems .
the re @-@ release happens in the context of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for shared use of content .
in West Africa , the ship was already known that this ship had already been powered by illegal fishing in liber@@ ation@@ ic waters , before it was searching the other coast of Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the East African countries were consequently raised and slightly inc@@ lined to welcome a law in its co@@ asts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Kom@@ res , Mozambique and the Seychelles mobili@@ ze quickly against the ship . they refused to gain one of their har@@ bours and refused to share a fishing ste@@ ad@@ ress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the Premier is surrounded by countries that you simply refused , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u re@@ members a leading employee of the Ken@@ yan fish@@ eries authorities . he is part of a team that discovered the ship during his time and followed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 , the ship was driven out of the waters of the region : it was not successful to catch fish there .
finally , it was comp@@ elled to pay 2 million US dollars in Liberia because of pill@@ age the country &apos;s fish stocks .
the core of this initiative , crossing the criminal practices and protects resources , F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the N@@ RO Stop illegal F@@ ishing ( Il@@ legal fishing ) was founded .
the members of this network are in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the six countries who had already exp@@ elled the Prime Minister from their waters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries , the same minded people and work together . they exchange information and stand out each other where it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , head of the Pe@@ w Char@@ itable Trust En@@ ding illegal F@@ ishing . this project offers F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is im@@ ited by definition : what is captured , is hidden that it is extremely difficult to track down because it is illegal fishing a leading cause of over@@ fishing of regions .
by deliber@@ ate abuse of existing laws , which should be protected by certain habit@@ ats and types , the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystem could harm that have a delicate balance .
but while actions against illegal fishing once were hin@@ dered by bureau@@ cratic hur@@ dles and also by the sn@@ ail @-@ pace , with the information between individual countries , the actions nowadays occur in real time , with trace@@ ability on F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
there , for example , individual countries can exchange opinions of existing licenses , news on suspic@@ ious activities or details that you had noticed or experienced during a port inspection .
fish @-@ i is also very attentive to the activities of ships , if they move on the open seas , by satellite data .
this allows the authorities to identify ships that fish in banned areas - such as suspic@@ ious driving routes - such as such that a ship invites his caught fish to other ships .
ideally , such studies show whether the participating ships have a fish@@ eries license where they were traveling and possibly even if they have a criminal register .
countries that are against illegal fishing , may refuse to accept such ships in their ports . what means that the ships cannot be selling their cargo . and that they may even be forced to pay off pen@@ alties , as in the prime minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s then about substantial financial losses for the owners , which means the illegal fishing catch is fin@@ anci@@ ally worthwhile . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , Director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consulting firm supporting the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i .
a closed front
the already mentioned platform was created to win an estimated 20 million USD in lost turnover , which will lose eight members of the network H@@ ISH @-@ i every year because of illegal fishermen who penet@@ rate in East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fishing spots that attracts the region &apos;s commercial fishing in all over the world . among these , those illegal fishermen .
these practices include actions such as the sailing under false flag , f@@ ake license papers , specif@@ ying iden@@ tik@@ it species , fish protected species and fishing in reserves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they take advantage of the lack of international cooperation and make the weak@@ nesses of a non @-@ seamless control system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier one ship was illeg@@ ally fishing and a country could say &apos; You must@@ n &apos;t walk along my port . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but another country could say &apos; Come to me &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and this legitim@@ ate lo@@ op@@ hole tries to close F@@ ISH @-@ i now . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so far the closed front works .
since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 studies in suspic@@ ious ships .
it has uncovered criminal networks , which had counter@@ feit licenses in Tanzania . these discovered ships who used several frau@@ dul@@ ent ident@@ ities and has found wing@@ ed ships and found .
due to his cooperation with Inter@@ pol , the international authority for com@@ b@@ ating crimes , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share information on illegal fishing across large distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks organised crime , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he builds a system that can help F@@ ISH @-@ i to provide suspic@@ ious ships .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite @-@ system , which will always be developed further , helps also hiding the illegal ships to hide themselves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , head analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , a NGO which also deals with fish@@ eries data and F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships can switch off their automatic identification systems , with which they can no longer be ordered by satellites .
Cop@@ eland helps to build a system that connects different information levels . it should help F@@ ISH @-@ i to find criminal ships with greater precision .
a model program
but F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team may actually influence the global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that .
recently , Sky@@ Truth opened together with Google and the Maritime conservation organization Oce@@ ana opens the platform Global F@@ ishing Watch : a platform that allows satellite data to be displayed worldwide by the position of any tracking ship worldwide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to accum@@ ulate with the neighbors to get a better picture of it , who knows what is doing - this is just sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and make their resources for an investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this in a global level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pe@@ w Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project with which a global system allows the persecution of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities did not only feel crimin@@ als but put it off .
ships which previously explo@@ ited without license and barely have to reck@@ on with consequences , know that they are observed .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u some of the countries involved in F@@ ISH , some 33 % increase in fish@@ eries sales , since many fishing boats bought more licenses .
after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia had assisted Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found there on board tow nets , whose use is forbidden .
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other countries also notice this successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that other countries will now copy us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in West Africa , several hundred million dollars will disappear every year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are six countries together in 2015 , at the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they also fight against illegal fishing , according to the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safety is the aim of creating more such initiatives and structures in other regions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s latest member country Somalia was able to report his first big triumph : in October , there were Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship which was under a false flag . and not only was the ship used without license and have been banned towing networks which are now prohibited .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ship was also entered into forbidden waters , reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the rules of Somalia , these were a strong sign that they proceed against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for F@@ ISH @-@ i this is a further success of many . and at the same time the evidence that such a special , collabor@@ ative collabor@@ ative act in the entire world of the world .

their articles appear in the Wi@@ red Magazine , TE@@ D Education , New York Times and in the Guardian . situation in Venezuela continues to spread : demonstrations in several cities with the aim to rec@@ laim the country &quot;
the road movements in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of fierce demonstrations .
they are regarded as a protest against the decision of the government to stop the referendum of President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the government of Venezuela was rejected by the opposition to a referendum on a referendum , the Vene@@ tians commenced the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country in which they were gathered on the streets . &quot; &quot; &quot;
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the withdrawal of Venezuela ) can be found both pictures of these demonstrations and arguments against them .
the debate will also be led in other parts of the country - among others in the low@@ land area of Bar@@ inas , in the An@@ den@@ regi@@ one Mé@@ rida and T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira , in the central north federal state Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita in the federal state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the country &apos;s political and economic situation deteri@@ or@@ ated continuously , what is noticeable in the everyday life of the Vene@@ tians by a acute lack of food and medicines . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many representatives of the opposition saw in the office of the current president Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro had the chance of a fundamental change , but ultimately the holding of a re @-@ election was blocked by the official authorities .
Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , Contributors at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ ises the context of the context of the government decision as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as part of the social , political and economic crisis , the inflation and fo@@ rested lack of food and medicine , is considered a referendum for many as the only way to give the country the chance to rec@@ laim its institutional structures and close a new government bund@@ le . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the electoral act of Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democr@@ á@@ tica or a short MU@@ D ( about : round table of Democratic Unit ) , in which the demonstr@@ ators joined the National Assembly , as well as a Mar@@ sch to the Mira@@ flo@@ res Palace , the Venezu@@ el@@ an government headquarters , on November 3 , should continue to continue blocking the referendum .
the call was posted on Twitter among other things as follows :
it &apos;s as far as Venezuela : tomorrow &apos;s National Assembly , Friday , nationwide civil strike and on 3 November all to Caracas on Mira@@ flo@@ res Palace .

&quot; the recovery of Venezuela &quot;
the first demonstration in the context of the programme &quot; The re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot; took place on Wednesday , 26 October .
the pictures of the fairy tale , which are published in real time , bear witness among others include an overwhelming participation of people in numerous areas of the country , but also disputes with polic@@ emen and advoc@@ ates of the government .
one of the most commonly shared pictures shows a demonstr@@ ators , who calls through the prot@@ ector : &quot; will you kill me because I have hunger ? &quot;
&quot; will you kill me because I have hunger ? , &quot; it cri@@ es from this Vene@@ tians .

on Twitter are images that tell of disputes , as well as reports of supp@@ ression and abuse .
especially big waves beat the news of police supp@@ ression in the central North of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
there , the protest@@ ers went back to local cathedral in order to protect themselves according to their own statement before the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government .
hours later they could safely leave the cathedral , but the protests went further .
in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop police officers , including this woman in the An@@ den@@ staat T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira :
the women in T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira do not wear skirts because otherwise something could not see what many nation@@ alities do not have !
meanwhile an inf@@ ograph@@ ics power , which forms the extent to op@@ pression each day :
thus the dictatorship has supp@@ ressed the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many representatives of the government had question@@ ed the validity of the demand for a minist@@ erial process - this has now been shown in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the road . &quot; &quot; &quot;
My@@ te@@ ks Media Labs are :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ dado claim that 1 % of signatures are fal@@ si@@ fied .
here is your counter@@ act !
on the road !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others have taken these protests as a further step in the fight against a government that has made a little against the devast@@ ating economic crisis , rather than aband@@ oning critical voices . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they took us so much - but also the fear !
fairy tales always take more to frequency and intensity .
some Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ ans reported media , they are hungry to take part in a strike , instead of working or shopping .

the interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to watch the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ inian city Córdoba .
in the context of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial , Qui@@ j@@ ano said goodbye to his father during the great La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera trial .
in the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes were studied that were committed during the Argent@@ in@@ ean military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano did not choose his life .
starting with the burden , same name as his father contribute to the brutal military operations at La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , has suffered enough .
he kept the family secret for 34 years .
in the situation at that time I thought that was fine .
I felt like a salary .
as a child with 15 years , you don &apos;t notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
I could not recognize that my father was a thief , folk music and mur@@ der@@ ers .
Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie@@ z . during the Argent@@ in@@ ean military dictatorship of 1974 to 1983 , his father was deputy commander of the secret service department 141 in prison La Per@@ la .

however , this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the op@@ press@@ ors who was accused of ab@@ duction in 158 cases , torture , murder in nearly 100 cases and the kidn@@ apping of a 10 year @-@ old child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os Son , a man who had witnessed the extent of atro@@ cities that he had witnessed as a boy , and he said before a German court against his own father .
his story shows what great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose a way of redemption .
from the sports hall to the military base
when my father started to take me to the military base , I went often with us into the sports hall . there I had friends who made martial arts .
everyone named him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ white photo and asked me to identify my boyfriend .
he said :
you are a dick@@ head , you have friends with one of the ERP .
they only believe they will not lead you one day and I must save you .
the abbrevi@@ ation is for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pueb@@ lo , - Revolution@@ ary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the Revolution@@ ary Workers Party of Argentina .
therefore he for@@ b@@ ade me to go back to the sports hall . a few days later he took me to work on the military base .
he told me , I would become a secret .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine . for that way my father had raised me .
on the military base , I had to destroy the papers that had heard the prisoners .
these were all possible documents : university clas@@ ps , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , simply everything .

&apos;@@ there the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
my father took me four times after La Per@@ la , everything in 1976 .
at the first and last time he left me at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time , he ordered me to go out . he led me to a bar@@ racks , in the cars , furniture , TV , fri@@ dges - just everything possible .
everything was stolen .
he gave me a little wrapped in a blanket and told me to wear it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a large cl@@ ump silver .
on that day I went to the other end of Bar@@ ac@@ ke , where the stolen items were removed , and refra@@ ined me with a guard .
suddenly he interpreted to an open space and said :
the prisoners are tor@@ tured over there .
I saw a couch and saw a couch , tor@@ tured on man .
it looked like a field bed and metal springs .
later I found out that they paved the end of a cable . the other end was fast@@ ened at the body &apos;s body which was just cap@@ tiv@@ ated there .
she rarely en@@ cap@@ tiv@@ ates people with wr@@ inkl@@ es on the bed , shot him with water and pursued a charge of 220 volts in the gen@@ itals .

the sten@@ ch there was terrible ... like a dirty wind .
years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came from his room .
I realized the smell immediately and me became clear that the smell of a body is in need .
I never forgot this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that a man can do so much suffering from another ?
&apos;@@ i knew that these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were cap@@ tiv@@ ated and clothed with palms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he spoke with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pe@@ z , a civilian who was also accused in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to cast a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the background I saw a number of matt@@ resses , on which naked people were lying down - they were cap@@ tiv@@ ated in hands and feet .
near the entrance to the elderly people still in the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father noticed I saw to the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you see that as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why did you bring me out ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and was buried by soldiers .
I know this because my father told her home .
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms that were designated as offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rom@@ ero struck a man and killed there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( according to survi@@ vors of civilians , Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also charged in the La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial , was accused of death by the Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Molina student .
the following video is Emi@@ lio F@@ essi@@ a , the director of the La Per@@ la Memorial , through the former Fol@@ lowing chambers .
the way you came in here is also the way you came here .
if you look at the map , see that they took about this path and then tor@@ tured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were assigned as part of the process of de@@ human@@ ization a number .
if they survived torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra till the arrangement of the above came , that they should be laid .
this was the lie - Euph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of people and the dis@@ appearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; war yield &apos;
my father brought all kinds of stolen things home .
at that time , I had no idea what the &quot; spo@@ ils &quot; - as they called it - was .
but when I was later on the military , I was in G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie - it was clear that war spo@@ ils are a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military signs , which one takes a fo@@ e that is fighting .

but if you go into a house and the fridge , turn@@ tables , clothes , paintings , money ... ste@@ als , then that is not a war yield but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
I have always wondered how my father , the leader of security forces , could participate in this v@@ and@@ alism .
I don &apos;t understand it .
I was an officer at the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never have liked to enter into a house and steal everything therein .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
once he called me a crime and I answered : and you , who flo@@ ats cars on the road ?
you are not a crime ?
he explo@@ ded anger , beat me , crying ,
if you go so far , I will find you and hand your own .
we need no one else !
so my father was .
I have no only good memory of him .
when I said in the process I showed a photo of that time I had a jacket and a wheel swe@@ ater of wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he still brought clothes with home .
at that time , the defense accused me of being a complic@@ ity in this crime . I said , no problem she can lay me about what they wanted .
I was there anyway to testify .
&apos;@@ The dis@@ appearance of the body is the last ab@@ omin@@ able act .
now , where I am older , I feel repent@@ ance .
I have children . if you only have children , you recognize the value of a life .
one develops on and recogni@@ zes that it is wrong to kill .
I went even so far to say :
well , you expressed people during the dictatorship . but for what the bodies disappear ?
why do children kid@@ nap children ?
one day my father brought a girl home , whose mother had been killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - just that this was a little girl .
I always asked me the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ?
they could simply have put them into prison .
I guess it was just decided to kill these people , but why their bodies disappear ?
did these people not have families where their mort@@ al remains were handed over ?
the dis@@ appearance of the body is the last ab@@ omin@@ able act , which one can do to a man .
my father told me when democracy was introduced again , they took machines to eliminate the mort@@ al rem@@ n@@ ants of the prisoners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they were crushed and somewhere ent@@ ails - no idea where . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will never find something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but anything remains forever .
&apos;@@ i &apos;ve seen how you killed people ! &apos;
only to declare it : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 crimin@@ als - including my father .
the thought , to show my father , arose during a conversation , while he was under house arrest .
I made him accus@@ ations because of all the atro@@ cities which I had to go because of him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I don &apos;t have killed anybody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I felt in@@ war@@ dly and asked me what the whole @-@ driven patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings , &quot; which they allegedly defended , were really good .
then I cried :
how can you tell me something ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed terrible crime , and you have forced me as a child to participate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he only replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;ll show me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
in 2010 , I refunded the first display .
I had finally recognized that he was a criminal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one can imagine that I am pre@@ bi@@ ased . I have finally told my own father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest until the end of the trial .
he was charged with 416 crimes charges in 158 cases , torture in 154 cases , murder in 98 cases , murder in 98 severe cases , torture with subsequent death sequence in five cases and a fall of ab@@ duction of under 10 years of child .

the judgments in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
the term &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to the mag@@ n@@ itude of judgment .
after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera trial ended in August 1975 and fought against 7@@ 16 victims in August 1978 .
43 The op@@ press@@ ors were found guilty of crimes against humanity . the Tribunal sentenced him life imprisonment in 28 cases , and in nine cases of prison sentences between 2 and 14 years .
eleven of the 54 def@@ endants died during the trial .
# La@@ Per@@ la@@ ze : murder , torture and rape by minist@@ ries . # Es@@ war@@ der terrorism
all def@@ endants were members of the military , including former military families , former police members and civilian personnel .
Pier@@ o De Mont@@ i was kidn@@ apped together with his pregnant woman in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he addressed the following words to the Swiss Chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory conceived by un@@ human heads .
the Court of jurisdiction is a historic landmark for all human rights organisations who have been working for years in justice for the victims .
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the Argent@@ in@@ ean organization H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , who represents the children of people who were murdered during the dictatorship or disappeared , said :
the trial took more than three years , but the research lasted for 39 years .
in March 2007 , the Argent@@ in@@ ean government handed down the country to La Per@@ la , so that a memorial could be erected there , which is now led by human rights organisations .

a translation error makes older people in Kyoto for &quot; terrible drivers &quot;
the sign with translation errors in a centre in Kyoto where you can extend his license .
the photo was distributed in the social media .
editing the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese city of Kyoto customers have been able to extend their driving licence in which one can pro@@ long his driving licence , last month witnesses a very am@@ used translation .
on a sign the Japanese word ( co@@ her@@ ons sha ) , which means &quot; older drivers &quot; means , wron@@ g@@ ly - but perhaps also with the bad background &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; as a &quot; aw@@ ful motor@@ ists &quot; was translated .
the wrong translation was read on electronic ads from 1 to 20 September in the lobby area and in the building itself .
editing the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine , which was often divided into social media .
the error was like the translator Julian Holmes , a population of Ky@@ oto , who was also aware of the local newspapers .
the daily Kyoto Shim@@ bu@@ n , written in Kyoto , wrote :
&quot; how could it come to an English translation ?
this proves that nobody has read the translation correction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is an ins@@ ult to older people and in an international city like Kyoto simply unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Holmes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the defective English translation was initially removed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) was later replaced by the reasonable term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elder drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of the Kyoto Pre@@ fecture was sorry for the translation errors . furthermore , she said that the error was already contained in the text , which they had been reviewed by the translator , and that the translation was not checked for their correc@@ t@@ ness before it was published .
a blo@@ gger reported about the ap@@ ology :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are sorry that older people felt by the in@@ sufficient correction ( the translation ) for our part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ Cast News made a bit more detailed with the phenomenon of the &quot; terrible &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
the word &quot; terrible &quot; has been den@@ ounced as an appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the share of older drivers who are involved in accidents but are absolutely cause for concern .
in the pre@@ fecture of Kyoto , for example , in 2005 1.@@ 9@@ 41 of a total of 19.@@ 460 crash@@ es were caused by sen@@ iors . this equ@@ ates to a share of 10 % .
ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors 1.@@ 80@@ 3 caused by a total of 11.@@ 850 accidents .
this increased its share to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents decreased in total , the proportion of sen@@ iors caused by sen@@ iors in the same period has increased .
the rep@@ orter didn &apos;t mention rep@@ orters in the release of article comments on the light that show pre @-@ judi@@ ces some Japanese apparently against older drivers :
the article on Yahoo about the translation errors got the following comments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is this ( aw@@ ful motor@@ ists ) about reality ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; So does the translation never fail , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think that is a real translation error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread in Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com website is a true discovery for these bizarre mistakes in English .
photo of Flickr user Andrew .
the reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are mani@@ fold .
to over@@ lay two important skills : passive language skills to understand the text , and to present active language skills to transfer him into the target language .
the latter requires an active control of the target language - something that is the case in mother@@ language . generally , the belief that trans@@ lat@@ ors should be in the target language - not in the language language - mother@@ language should be .
a French native language should translate into English for example from English to French - not French into English .
photo of Flickr user Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ staff with English as a native language , which could produce translations into English . this may be due to mis@@ understanding , cost , or the relatively low number of English mother@@ spe@@ ars who are learning Japanese .
some companies , who do not have foreign employees , make translations more fir@@ ing internally . then the Japanese staff , whose English knowledge becomes the best , become a translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are .
photo of Flickr user Karl Baron .
machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results .
the ver@@ itable and en@@ ig@@ matic sentences that arise by machine translations , show that this technology can not yet replace a human trans@@ lat@@ ors . this applies to some languages .
some of the stran@@ gest English form@@ ulations in Japan , among them also the majestic prints , which are often used t @-@ shirts or bags , are used only for sty@@ list@@ ic reasons - not to be read or understood not at all .

translation errors may be still acceptable or at least harmless . however , from large companies or from the government that have the means to ensure higher standards , you can expect more careful translations .
in the future , the city of Kyoto will hopefully make a serious source for their translations .
Venezuela : protest and c@@ ens@@ orship on Internet and Television
main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( Frei@@ es Sur@@ fing ) of the IP@@ YS ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y So@@ c@@ ie@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , 7 April , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users reported that they had no access to the online channel Viv@@ op@@ lay .
later on , other users have signed the internet performances of V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV also no longer available .
other online stations carried out the protests of the protests in Caracas , which were organized by op@@ position@@ ist groups , opposed to the government Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros .
the protests began in early April , after the Supreme Court cleared the parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s duties to the executive and the Supreme Court .
Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a Tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection is glu@@ ed , and recommended for users to receive VPN ( virtual private networks ) to access the Internet .
# c@@ ens@@ orship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that web sites of Venezu@@ el@@ an providers are again locked .
this is from the site of @ Viv@@ o@@ Play@@ net .
offerings like Viv@@ op@@ lay are popular among the Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ ans with internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; traditional media have been in coverage of protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission threatened with money fir@@ ing and closing arguments if they continued to report on the demonstrations by the Commission , as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; call to violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have registered again at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net without cable TV and informative national television channels .
it is aston@@ ishing that it is still cheaper than buying two liters of li@@ on@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ I fil@@ in@@ tro confirmed that not only Viv@@ op@@ lay is accessible through a blocking of the domain name system ( DNS ) , but also two other online stations . this also concerns the website where the National Assembly transfers its sessions .
former research institutes of the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that the local internet providers sometimes use DNS . it is a technique to respond to a certain domain of certain domains .
if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server respon@@ ds or ref@@ uses the request to call such a website .
we confirm a DNS lock : @ el@@ el@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
in V@@ P@@ IT@@ V , a third locked channel , the transmission was stopped on Thursday , April 6 , when the V@@ P@@ IT@@ V c@@ amer@@ aman Elvis Flo@@ res , who performed protests in Caracas , was taken into custody .
Flo@@ res was defeated , while he was in police custody .
he was released eight hours later and V@@ P@@ IT@@ V went back to shipment .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it was also reported that the government is regulated by Internet connections : thus Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ ans will continue to continue access to multi@@ media coverage of the current events of the country .
in Paraguay , many girls will become slaves to preserve a training
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a child a cri@@ ad@@ ita . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today Tina fights for the rights of children and collec@@ ts witnesses of other cri@@ pts , which were just as they were victims of abuse and discrimination . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo of Cecilia Ro@@ jas . use of the friendly permission of the town .
the following article is the shortened version of the report , published by Global Vo@@ ices , courtesy of the authors .
the article is part of a series titled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , es@@ cu@@ elas que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; F@@ ed cows , falling schools &quot; ) , edited by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America and is re@@ published .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived for eight years in a household , where they did not live together with the family who lived there .
shortly before she graduated from the university , she returned to the house again and heard the owner of the house full of pride above her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a has never been treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old she began to work as Cri@@ ad@@ ita for the family . as Cri@@ ad@@ itas , one design@@ ates the more than 46@@ ,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the shop is quite simple : a big family with little money gives her min@@ der@@ year old son or her min@@ der@@ year daughter to another , rich family . in exchange , the child receives food , a training and a roof over the head .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is not mentioned , however , is that the children have to pay for it countless days of house@@ work that can never be paid and sacrifice of abuse and abuse - and all that is within the context of a treaty you can not lift . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this practice , as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go , is widely used in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance of large parts of the society and despite numerous complaints of human rights organisations .
after completing her studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization that fought for the rights of the boys and girls .
she spoke with Cri@@ ad@@ itas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected stuff , resear@@ ched and den@@ ounced .
she tried to call the things by name , as the feeling of gratitude that is vacc@@ inated in the Cri@@ ad@@ itas , guaranteed in general .
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a explains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since it is part of the family that will complete their daughter in the belief that they can make their position in society and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make something out of itself &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; to another family . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the family , who rel@@ ates the girl with herself and just@@ i@@ fies his exploitation with faith , that she would have a chance to get a chance , and perhaps even star@@ ved .
the victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
if the girl is har@@ assed , his family will experience only many years later .
sometimes they never hear about it .
in January 2016 , the previously unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the hidden in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ish households , but a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ ín entered into the hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed traces of heavy stro@@ kes . in short , she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ ad@@ ita in the household of former military family Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as an official partner at the entrance fee .
Mar@@ ín lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ on .
at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ re@@ ira struck as long as with a stick to Mar@@ ín , until they suffered deadly injuries .
this should be the last punishment in the life of a young girl .
a few days later the media reported about the incident .
they con@@ sent@@ ed that the murdered child was cri@@ m@@ ita .
organizations like UNICEF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the deep in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Society for the death of the girl .
they signed the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as a &quot; modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came together to protest documents and demanded that there &apos;s no further Carolina in Paraguay .
the girl &apos;s name and photos were widespread in the social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay , more cows are registered as children , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
without papers , it is much easier to hurt the rights of children .
without official documents it is very difficult to control , under which conditions do boys and girls live .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the neighbours of the couple and almost 60 civil society organizations demanded an excellent examination of the case . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they want Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl who was to be sentenced to 30 years in prison .
if the case is in front of the court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín may be landmark , if it is the case for the first time in the history of Paraguay .
everyday life of a Cri@@ ad@@ ita
the Cri@@ ad@@ itas are not only explo@@ ited as workers , they are also isolated from other girls in their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bi@@ k worked in which her father worked to register bank@@ rupt@@ cy and lost his father &apos;s work .
their brothers now had to work and began to sell on the street or on the market swe@@ ets to earn money .
but they went all further to school .
only Tina has been sent to the capital As@@ unci@@ on in the capital As@@ unci@@ on .
in the house of their employer Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day .
so they had to share the time that their time to learn about it .
it stood up every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared the breakfast for their employer .
for example , cleaning the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and the infected floor .
when the school was at the end , she went back home and had time for learning .
the more they finished with learning , the more free time she had .
but this time was limited , because they had to make dinner for their employer .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she had to never star@@ ving , but also didn &apos;t get unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to get more books from the library of the budget as food from the fridge , &quot; she re@@ minded .
the library was well equipped and belonged to the budget , a former military and symp@@ a@@ is@@ ants of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party that was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who belonged to the opposition from 1954 to 1989 .
on some evenings the landlord Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , to stand beside him and read Editorial from Opp@@ os@@ ition@@ ers , such as &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pueb@@ lo &quot; to read .
he tried to persu@@ ade them to persu@@ ade them to don@@ ate the reports of the official media on the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he held her for intelligent , but not with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the house@@ keeper had found someone who heard while he talked about politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t often allow me to visit my family because they were the opinion that I heard there again &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bad hab@@ it &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; so they supposed that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a belongs to the indigenous group of the Guaran@@ i , at home again their native language Guaran@@ i would speak . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their Lord feared that she had the education that she would allow her to lose again , she explains .
however , you were totally clear that she had paid for everything she paid with her hard work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also in school Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a discrimin@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing about which almost never spoken is mo@@ b@@ bing and the ch@@ ic@@ ans who are exposed to the school when they go to school . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because the other children have parents , they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents , a cri@@ m@@ ita is .
I could not invite anyone home . I had no friends in school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , where friend@@ ships arise , I feel particularly obvious that I was not one group .
the isolation was the worst of all , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
Society appro@@ ves the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where they can share place for cleaning agents and children &apos;s workers in Paraguay .
the administ@@ rators of the group is Pep@@ a Kost@@ ian@@ ov@@ sky , a city council in the As@@ unci@@ on district .
hello ! I &apos;m looking for a little companion for my little daughter , who plays in the morning and in the afternoon with her .
for learning .
please speak to you .
starting from Monday , if possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ad received five &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; likes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and many comments . &quot; &quot; &quot;

bill , writing Egyptian users of social media , registered at the government

&quot; &quot; &quot; sixty Egyptian par@@ liament@@ arians had recently agreed to a bill to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regul@@ ators regarding use and commercial social networks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he is accepted by the Parliament , users must register social media in Egypt at a government agency to use social media , including Facebook and Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
based on the law , a place would be established , which is thus commissioned to share the citizens &apos; citizens &apos; permission to share social media .
within six months with acceptance of the law users would have to register users with their right names and staff numbers to use social networks .
if it failed to do this , it could cause a sentence of up to six months in prison or a fine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the bill that consists of six agra@@ ph@@ s and in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt independent , defines social media as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; jed@@ we@@ de application that is going on the internet and used to communicate with others by voice , video and text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is clear how the law is passed through , as the draft is supposed to impos@@ e no indication of the fact that the Egyptian government should not make up the regist@@ ers of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to ensure the regulation on the level of social media companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Abdul Satt@@ ler , parliamentary deputy and promotion of the bill , registered user name and users , registered user name and a password &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; registered user name and a password &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the fire@@ wall , blocked the Facebook &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this could mean Egypt plans to establish a fire@@ wall in the national level around Facebook . it would be necessary to submit information on their identity for the Egyptians , to access the network . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is not known so far that such plans consist .
experts and experts on site are scep@@ tical about the technical fe@@ asi@@ bility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y R@@ ao@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; senior researcher &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have doubts about the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things that have to do with technology . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in my opinion , they imagine that just as they ra@@ viol@@ ate physical and private spaces it could also be done online .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I take them seriously , it means that they need to filter a strong monitoring system , or do not apply for citizens who require permission or not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that means a mad system to monitor the activities of human beings , and to bring it to a court process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is by no means realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed by the Parliament and the Constitutional Court before being deb@@ ated in the plenary debate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether his acceptance and en@@ forcement is successful or not , the draft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in line with one pro @-@ military thinking in parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ized and ensured that no ev@@ asive nar@@ ration is present on the screen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says R@@ ao@@ of . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed a bill of legislative against cy@@ ber crimin@@ ality , which was found guilty of a life imprisonment for those who were found guilty on &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; to gras@@ p protest . &quot;

high up in the mountains of the Kurdistan region in the north @-@ east of Iraq , the veter@@ inary surgeon H@@ ana Ahmed Raz@@ a and her team from scientists of the NGOs in Nature are working to protect the mental Persian le@@ op@@ ards .
a sub@@ type of the larger family of Leop@@ ards , which ro@@ ams through Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian Leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . in total , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are due to wil@@ der@@ y , loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat , as they always find less prey .
why is this certain kind of le@@ op@@ ard so important ?
as Raz@@ a shows in the video , &quot; the Persian Leopard is the only remaining pre@@ dat@@ ory in the Kurdish ecos@@ ystem &quot; and the health and the de@@ fun@@ nel of the ecos@@ ystem also depends on that a large pre@@ dat@@ ory is present .
the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard in fact is small and goes towards zero . as the team in the video therefore noted that she has a recording of a big cat on camera everyone breaks down Raz@@ a in pure joy .
as a trained biolog@@ ist , Raz@@ a shows a different side of her country , which is not only in war and conflict .
she has been involved in field studies for wild animals and educational programs of Nature Iraq for six years .
it has also been a member of IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group since 2013 and is ensuring that protection zones for wildlife in the Kurdistan region are set up .

in early March 2017 , the Daily K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o , the adv@@ ances that have been achieved for the North @-@ East Japan have been hit by the life of those who have been hit by the &quot; triple catastrophe &quot; of March 2011 . a massive earthquake , a tsun@@ ami and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hima had triggered the disaster .
K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in S@@ end@@ ai , which is located in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ fecture . the pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was a great pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures in Japan &apos;s Nor@@ theast , which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting tsun@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbor@@ ing nests Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate were forced , because the tsun@@ ami had van@@ ished whole coastal cities from the map .
still even the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima had a nuclear accident , already alone , 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o special report shows which progress has been reached for six years , in order to re@@ build the life of local authorities .
the extensive report of the newspaper contains both statistics of the Japanese re@@ generative authority as well as survey results of those affected by themselves .
the apartment building in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper reports that by December 2015 , a total of 77 per cent of the planned spare parts ( the base , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate have been completed .
the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures was reported in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , where 80 percent of the planned spare parts were finished .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hima represents a total of 70 percent .
after the catastrophe more , six years after the catastrophe , was evacu@@ ated by dom@@ ination of dom@@ ination ( standardized , kas@@ et@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) to re@@ locate in final replacement houses .
after the triple catastrophe , nearly 80 000 people were forced to live under control skills .
in December 2016 , 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate lived in such Beh@@ aus@@ ungen .
nearly 40 per cent of the year 2011 evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima still lives in emergency , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was successful . more than 75 per cent of the evacu@@ ated houses , who breath@@ ed after the disaster , were settled in final houses .
for I@@ w@@ ate , the number here is 34 percent .
the stand of works and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
like the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper , 10@@ 74 was able to determine from 1100 schools that were affected by mis@@ fortune , their doors to December 2016 , which makes almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later , the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is much more difficult .
while nearly 100 percent of the fishing ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are back in operation , only 30 percent of the fishing ports are re @-@ recorded in Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
tsun@@ ami and nuclear accident , have with@@ drawn the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agr@@ arian land in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agr@@ arian land .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i could recover 93 percent of its agricultural areas , whereas only 66 percent of the agricultural land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed farm@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hima can be re @-@ used .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the atomic fact that only 690 acres of 5 400 hectares of destroyed farm@@ lands of Fu@@ kus@@ hima , are in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nuclear remote zone &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures the tourism subsi@@ ded again , but also here Fu@@ kus@@ hima remains unbe@@ aten .
the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are again up to 90 percent of the same level as before the disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hima , on the other hand , can have only 75 percent .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper reports that since the catastrophe nearly half of the coastal population , it is more difficult to earn their li@@ vel@@ ih@@ ood .
is the indigenous population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
in order to determine a picture , the newspaper conducted numerous question@@ ings under the local population and under the evacu@@ ated population . she question@@ ed them concerning the state of the reconstruction and also how their feeling towards the tsun@@ ami risk has changed .
in her introduction of the article , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper explains :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o led a survey to bring more about the tsun@@ ami consciousness among the native population in experience .
the survey carried out that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local population resident measures have taken measures to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and tsun@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of respon@@ dents say that still not enough in the dis@@ asters of dis@@ asters has been done .
as it stands for those who had to evacu@@ ate from the Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ fecture
in its issue to the anniversary of earthquake , K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper has reinforced its attention also to the situation of evacu@@ ated Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
Fu@@ kus@@ hima had not only had to experience the massive earthquake and devast@@ ating tsun@@ ami , no , the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima had also been a witness to the worst , nuclear dis@@ astro@@ us , atomic fact that Japan had to participate .
almost 63 000 people were evacu@@ ated outside the pre@@ fecture of 160 000 evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
at the beginning of 2016 , some more than 23 000 people were res@@ ett@@ led back to Fu@@ kus@@ hima , in permanent replacement houses .
after 2017 , 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hima still live outside their home pre@@ fecture .
in the emergen@@ cies most of the evacu@@ ated areas are most of the evacu@@ ated areas , older than 50 years old . they have to be back in proper per@@ missions because they have to compete for the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hima joined by massive construction projects , which are part of the Olympic Games that will be held in Tokyo in 2020 .
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when people encountered people from other countries who speak a different language , the differences seem to be bigger than the comm@@ on@@ alities .
after a while , however , one considers that a more combines one more than it seems at first sight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these global links are important as they challenge our advantages , extend our perspectives , and remember that the world is ultimately very small . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices pod@@ cast , we look exactly these global links . in our In@@ to the Deep Podcast we treat topics that often get fewer attention than they deserve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members that remember one moment , in which it felt very strongly linked with someone about language and country borders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Veron@@ iki Kri@@ kon@@ i speaks about the simil@@ ar@@ ities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i Cam@@ ar@@ asa re@@ members how the love of music has been a lack of common language knowledge during a journey in the rural China ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experience he collected in a small village in Madagascar .

right : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva at a widespread photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered this week into the intensive care unit : last Friday , a police officer had hit him during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with a striking impact on his head . nationwide , millions of protest@@ ers took part in a protest march .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , who studied social sciences at the University of Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered a skull @-@ trau@@ ma and several frac@@ tures .
doctors took him this Saturday and now put him into an artificial coma .
his condition is regarded as critical .
the local photo journalist Lu@@ iz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , spread quickly within a few days fast in Brazil .
the face of the police officer has also been identified with a strike . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police announced in the Brazilian federal state of Go@@ i@@ ás that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had been suspended until the conclusion of the incident recorded by the active service .
the pictures show the police officers , as in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with his striking on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Luz ) .
if a police officers were beaten by a demonstr@@ ators and land on the intensive care , his face would be for six months in television and the entire op@@ pression would be justified .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Facebook page &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Des@@ neur@@ aliz@@ ador &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a video channel from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , shared the video from Lu@@ iz da Luz , in which one sees how Mat@@ eus was attacked from the police officers , and several San@@ itary visits to him shortly afterwards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
another video with the same scenes , but filmed from a different perspective , is also immersed in social networks .
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another federal state , have now donated 10,000 Brazilian re@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 euros ) to ensure a part of the cost of medical treatment and to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , while he is located in the hospital .
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus .

on Facebook Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for more violence against activ@@ ist at Go@@ i@@ ás :
Go@@ i@@ ás experiences a wave of political power : here the activ@@ ist Gu@@ il@@ her@@ me Irish was killed by his father , and here was a occupied school with a gas le@@ ck . and now we have been attacked the very sad case of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , who has been attacked by a polic@@ eman , who has been attacked by a polic@@ eman , who has hit him on his face .
police lock @-@ handles
Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil in which it came to brutal police action against protest@@ ers last Friday .
polic@@ emen put on protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where protest@@ ers had built a stage for speakers , rubber boots and Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as .
the MEP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , social and peace party ( PS@@ OL ) asked the police to aband@@ on violence against protest@@ ers .
this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the country .
once again , the Brazilian Media street pros@@ este ver@@ ts by pushing the focus on another , unexpected prot@@ agon@@ ists : a wind@@ shield .
the fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo were reported specifically about a cereb@@ ral glass windows to illustr@@ ate a photo of their title pages .
in contrast , the O Glob@@ o preferred a title story with a bus set .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason , more than a broken window disc than the protests of thousands of people who serve the defense of a special thing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you have to recognize this , if you are strictly opposed to any form of damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ and@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also receives a absurd , un@@ disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ate meaning , and the typical violence of the military police are tu@@ cked using the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; demonstr@@ ators &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the police &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; demonstr@@ ators &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Un@@ ity Vill@@ ages forgotten in Cuba
with the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ var@@ o Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugar cane factories entered the doors in Cuba ( photo : Julio B@@ atist@@ a )
the community of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , which is located in the western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - known , regardless of that there are no significant sugar harvest@@ ing on site .
it is two years ago when the activities were l@@ ame in the sugar cane factories .
after the harvest the sugar cane industry stood still in the region , and the factory lost after and after its installations , until only the rum@@ ours of steel and concrete remained .
about 272 workers had to re@@ invent themselves .
some changed the work .
others signed and comm@@ ute daily to the factories , which still gr@@ ind .
N@@ ene , a solo v@@ ector , rising every day at 4 : 00 a.m. , the crisis in the sugar cane is not bol@@ ted on his sleep .
he heard that in the east of the region sugar @-@ factories , which are in operation after a long @-@ active time , because they were received .
that was something he was not expected .
N@@ ene rec@@ alls exactly to have heard that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane factory would get , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar cane industry already resist@@ ed the pl@@ agues , the fall of socialism , the low market prices , in@@ efficiency , bad management decisions and climate change .
in 2016 the production was 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than the 1910 produced quantity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message would have been a motive for a couple of decades ago to worry about the country , but the bad yields are no longer any longer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
why was the Cuban sugar cane ?
the old platform of the community saw better times .
( photo : Julio B@@ atist@@ a )
the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economical requirement : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically ob@@ sol@@ ete , and hardly competitive they were im@@ measur@@ able for the country .
the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production objective was 4 million tonnes .
they just left the factories , the sugar for maximum 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0,@@ 03 Euro ) can produce .
the solution to unemployment ?
the motives which led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the global market .
nevertheless the sugar price increased in front of about one decade .
from 2017 until 2025 , the price of un@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the 2016 edition of &quot; Land@@ scapes &quot; by the OECD and FAO , the Agricultural and Food Organization of the United Nations .
when the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , raw sugar exports would generate about 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the day &apos;s day will certainly be in history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were the first words of the Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from then on , the process of restructuring began in the sugar industry .
in the following years , it came to a total of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for further education .
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on May 14 , 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez worked in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if N@@ ene , as a soldier is known for the closure of the factory , is the word that he repe@@ ats the most , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dec@@ eit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents agree : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
in order to get the place , they formed a full @-@ time working group .
before the first time year , the first letters began to come .
it was officially designed for documents which were removed only regarding the parts that would be removed , the address and the date .
all were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister was able to appro@@ ve each withdrawal .
from then on , the responsibility was over@@ seen and the letters were getting more common .
Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the l@@ act@@ ate factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for which he had grown in operation .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years waiting for retirement in another complex that Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was involved with his will at the halt of the factory in which he helped him .
with every part he removed , he dismant@@ led one of his 31 years of work .
the best developed industrial area in Cuba and the most important workplace producers was extingu@@ ished .
in many cases , no alternatives were created for the employment and services that generated the facilities in the con@@ greg@@ ations where they found themselves .
we will never know if during the mamm@@ oth @-@ speech of 21 October 2002 , the former president in the eyes of the present persons saw , when he guaranteed for the areas whose factories were not in operation for five years , everything was going well run .
the price of the population for the closure of the sugar cane factories
since 2004 , sugar cane is extracted only high by hand .
( photo : Julio B@@ atist@@ a )
after two years the popular community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that lots of things change , but not always the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane factory closed , or better said than they began to stop them , they also listened to the road to asphalt , but also dis@@ advant@@ aged other establ@@ ishments .
without a job in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to search other factories .
they have become spare parts .
without any future eye view , many young people also left the region .
a food factory was created in the area , whose production is not even for the supply of the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
at the end of 2016 N@@ ene came back to the factory of Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work .
Ne@@ un@@ und@@ forty yields the old soldiers a pension of two thousand p@@ es@@ o a month to spend the years retired in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich .
Mr N@@ ene , a man black skin colour , small , with a few teeth and clear@@ er voice , is no follow@@ er person , yet he gives the lies that told him not .
they tor@@ ment him for ten years .
N@@ ene goes up to 65 years in R@@ ente , not because it is lacking in force , but because he is bit@@ tered .

youth of First Nations @-@ Communities in all over Canada deal with themes that are important for them . they are doing hip @-@ hop , thanks to a number of hiking workshops .
as part of the N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an tour since 2014 , workshop manager mobile audio studios put directly to schools and youth centres , for youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were led by the ped@@ agog@@ ues David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and worked together in Nord @-@ Quebec with ten Cre@@ e communities and then worked together with the Cre@@ e Hip Hop Group The Nor@@ th@@ Stars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the workshop is increasing the young participants in talks like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cultural identity , language , meditation , love , self @-@ acceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or whatever the meaning emerges . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these questions are inspired by inspiration for songs and videos in which you@@ ths are the main actors .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the U.S. state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this video of the school &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ yo@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the area of the tribe of the kit@@ ties in British Columbia example tells the story of the Highway 16 , also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Highway of Te@@ ars &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a road section in West@@ kan@@ ada , on which almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women were missing or murdered . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cases were largely incomplete .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motive of a video player to mediate , as important to receive traditional customs and customs despite the influences of glob@@ alization .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people do not always rule the languages of First Nations .
in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation has recorded , the refra@@ in will be sung in Cre@@ e .
the young people involved some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from Nor@@ th@@ stars hip @-@ hop group who gave them a verse in the dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e .
on the fac@@ ebook site of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an the verse is available , as well as a translation into English , which is translated into German :
sometimes I feel like I wouldn &apos;t be interested in myself
but I try to keep my days on Earth
this is the day you will get our cry .
because we have lost our way in life
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I believe that we will rise one day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
so they can grow and lead our youth as well
thus , they can do that which determines the Creator ,
in the commentary part , the reader and advoc@@ ate of Cre@@ e @-@ Language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also adds a post and adds the verse in Sil@@ ben@@ z ( which is also published on his blog and published here with permission ) :
in Japan , plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant
base @-@ Floor : the base of a typical restaurant in Japan .

in Japan there can be seen before almost every restaurant sculp@@ tural dishes .
to show potential customers what is exact on the menu , are exhibited in the vicinity of the entrance of sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( the base , &quot; plastic models of the courts &quot; ) , served by any food that is served in this restaurant .
customers can look at this plastic dishes , then decide whether they enter the restaurant or continue .
there is an entire industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes .
in K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi district of K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi , there is a multitude of these small businesses that produce these plastic dishes , documented by the German filmmaker W@@ im Wen@@ ders in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a over 20 years ago .
for most Japanese , these plastic dishes are usually taken to them all . a new trend , however , trans@@ forms them today in show@@ y mobile accessories and other g@@ ad@@ gets .
at Na@@ ver Mat@@ omes , the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i series published by social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
now in special sale : new plastic coating decorated with plastic dishes , such as they are shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u Kauf@@ haus .
many of these artificial foods have been transformed into kit@@ sch@@ y collecting objects , as in this case , fridge mag@@ nets :
here are some Sho@@ ku@@ hin cool@@ box mag@@ nets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom of food@@ stu@@ ffs is increasingly complex .
in this case , an imperi@@ al @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl ) was transformed into a cell stand .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as a mobile stand .
also this part we produced for the exhibition in Tokyo Station .
and here is an apple that cap@@ tures your mobile phone :
designed to look like an apple , with a score for the mobile phone , this is already a great design .
and that &apos;s just the beginning of an increasing flight into the coma .
some mobile support and mobile phone designers allow you to create your own work of art . in this case , ik@@ ura res@@ cu@@ ffs is used , a popular t@@ opping which is served with white rice .
on Twitter , some users had their doubts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; is there someone who would say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wow , cool , now I can decorate my mobile phone with salmon ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I &apos;ll probably be the only one .
this interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appe@@ ti@@ zing form , to surprise for instance colleagues or family members .
our latest mobile stand has the shape of melting ice .
in addition , there are also rice balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , earrings and wrist@@ bands from dried salmon .
you can view other sc@@ anned plastic dishes at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter to the h@@ ash@@ tag # 1 .
if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trends , then this video gives you insight into the city of K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi , which is devoted to the taste of the restaurant industry . as for example with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
the following video shows how Japanese plastic dishes actually are produced .
a Mexican project tells the stories of the survi@@ vors of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; for the victims of the struggle against the drug traff@@ ickers . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in reports and foreign media about the not@@ orious &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fight against drug traff@@ icking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico they are regularly sc@@ rut@@ in@@ ized and ge@@ ared regularly in statistics . however , these are not reflected the extent of the human tragedy that this battle brings together . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the coverage of drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , chief of the S@@ inal@@ oa boxes , urged the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background .
on the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the weddings or the con@@ greg@@ ations that have learned to live with pain .
behind each bone , behind each bone refund in the hundreds of secret tom@@ bs , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners , whose wounds will never be healed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico formed the digital project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Apr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir Con El Nar@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( german : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with drug traff@@ icking to live &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , which told these victims a voice and told stories of people who were forced to fight between the prosec@@ utions and car@@ c@@ els . &quot; &quot; &quot;
animal Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project so :
organized crime cannot only fear our lives .
the effects are much profound .
for example , when businesses close , because they are threatened by drug traff@@ ickers and all mun@@ icipalities have to drive many kilometers to buy something like milk .
the pain of the victims
&quot; &quot; &quot; a video entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vi@@ das que cam@@ bian p@@ or el m@@ ie@@ do &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( german : &quot; like fear life &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) tells exactly these stories . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who is looking for secret graves after his son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ guez , who lost her father on only one day , lost her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ phe@@ w . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ est : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like every Sunday we prepare ourselves for the task that we have made us to get started and go to graves after the people who we loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric store in El N@@ aran@@ jo .
on October 13 he left the house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on October 15th he should be back again , but he never came again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s very difficult for me , because I am now alone with three children who need training . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is also my mother , who is also with me here .
at the moment she has no income .
you are the insurance of my father , but they don &apos;t pay them out because they require a death certificate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; where should we get that ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the editors of &quot; Apr@@ ender a vi@@ vir con el nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must not only show the faces of those who make fear . we must show the international community the conflicts , the frag@@ ility and the government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the project is based on stories by readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ HB , a reader of Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central mex@@ ico .
your contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal , in which form it occurs :
I have been aware of illness and sensation @-@ journ@@ alism now for several years now .
I am coming to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks every day and see the title pages with images that are actually only from a textbook for crimin@@ ology or experts from experts .
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only one that is dis@@ gu@@ essed or sad . it works as a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body .
I can &apos;t be in@@ different or consider it normal .
she writes on :
no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 year old c@@ ousin thinks that he is big . and it &apos;s not normal to hear people &apos;s songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic &quot; of the off@@ ences , when they walk through the streets .
for me it is , as if they have lost those who have lost someone and those who have fear that something happens to them too .
I see our weakness , when stories will become naked numbers in a statist@@ ic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the in@@ action of people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the dis@@ appearance of 43 students in a neighbor@@ ing resort is justified by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think they are trying to persu@@ ade them to remain spar@@ ed of such trage@@ dies , if they are not stirring and still .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the article &quot; Four months &quot; ex@@ tor@@ tion in the Capital District : like a family with threats issued by threats , until they were not only destroyed by the business , but they did not only break their family apart .
you think of everything you &apos;ve lost and about how many people can change your whole life in just a few days .
the pain of it passes away , the trau@@ ma remains , the fear comes up again when you are alone .
habits have changed , phone numbers also .
we just contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the more we are from each other , the better .
she graduated her report with the words :
we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they will kill or kill you .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I asked myself in these aw@@ ful days , if I would need to dissolve my deepest rooted feelings , but the answer is no : I have forgotten how to we@@ ep . I have to learn to live with the pain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a generation of violence signed . &quot;
in the introduction he raises questions like : who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime ?
what is it like to grow in a settlement on the outskirts of the dangerous city of Mex@@ ic@@ os ?
he is not like any other age of his age , whose parents are taking care of them .
Bryan is a f@@ ather@@ less and he tells us to teach himself how to make a egg , cook potatoes , tort@@ illas warm and &quot; ch@@ ichi &quot; for the k@@ ittens . this is his name for the preparation of the vial with water , sugar and milk powder .
he talks about the nine fo@@ ols on his left leg - one for every year &apos;s life .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy who consists of violence and who had to learn to live thereby .
when he was five years old , one told him that his mother disappeared .
but that was not the day that his childhood ended .
his childhood was over two years ago , when he saw only a few blocks from his home , the bloody body of his father , who had been shot by armed men from a passing car .
when Bryan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this :
Bryan was born in 2006 , as a force mixed by the organized crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murder according to public security and government of the United States government .
in 2010 alone , the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors was 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de , representing 8.5 Mor@@ den per day .
these are only some of hundreds of thousands of stories that organized the organized crime in Mexico and penet@@ rate the soul of the country .
just a few stories we still live in the face of the new head@@ lines . but this project reminds us of those who we must not forget .
in addition to the project &quot; Apr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir Con El Nar@@ co &quot; created the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose aim is to depic@@ t the complex information behind the failed struggle against the drug traff@@ icking , which has tor@@ tured the country in the past four decades , in understand@@ able manner .
if a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; from the Flickr user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ ström ( CC @-@ BY @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ ING : this post and the pages that he linked , contain images , on which violence is represented .
the factor check is important in one moment , in which it is about to raise a rum@@ or or fal@@ si@@ fication .
but how is the years since something has occurred ? content in social media , no matter whether true or un@@ true , ten@@ ds to pass on .
let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) .
since its initial release , it was used to show supporting trage@@ dies that actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this false coupling of image and event - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; false description &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - do not deny that there is plenty of careful coverage of events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but there are questions about our desire for pictures on messages .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 , a tank car crossed the place San@@ ge in the East of the DR Congo , ki@@ pp@@ te around and explo@@ ded . 230 people came to life .
after the civil war , Africa had been neglec@@ ted and rav@@ aged for years . the roads in the region became dangerous paths , which were difficult to drive .
trag@@ ically , the tan@@ ker fell victim to the victims .
the Government officials described a fire@@ ball , the dozens of houses covered , including a cinema in the vicinity , which was full of people who illustr@@ ate the soccer world championships .
houses viol@@ ated and shortened cor@@ p@@ ses scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to ignor@@ ance .
a picture with the title &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; from the Im@@ g@@ ur User Myst@@ ical Monkey , 12th January 201@@ 5.@@ Mehr@@ ing photos of the incident form the ugly scenes of this day .
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of hollow body , lined up on the ground , while people watch it .
but here the story doesn &apos;t find their end .
over the years , the same photo was taken several times on social media , blogs , and other platforms , but was not attributed to the trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what did not happen in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , the B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote villages of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported dra@@ stically about atro@@ cities , before they had to flee .
houses and shops were burnt down and cor@@ p@@ se were in streets and bus@@ hes .
reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one remained behind to count bodies , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a inhabitants to Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many were crushed , shot or burned .
only on the basis of satellite images the following time could be depicted .
the reason for the attack was also un@@ solved , but the army base in Bagh@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the B@@ oko Har@@ am &apos;s attempt to win the country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture emerges from the DR Congo as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack was presented :
that is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days to Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from DR Congo is only one in a number of mis@@ de@@ preci@@ ation ; Africa Check has been documented in Nigeria since 2014 .
in all of these cases the image has been presented as a cover for measures .
another step further bring personal comments such as this example f@@ aded the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media related to arguments .
the picture from San@@ ge also appeared in conjunction with the fatal persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a lightning response published by the United Nations , those who have been able to flee , rape and some dead , some caused by burning .
while others reported from violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , post@@ s , like the following , brought these descriptions with photos from the DR Congo :
this picture comes from an aci@@ di @-@ Arab news page that was fal@@ sely maintained that President My@@ An@@ m@@ ars Th@@ an being took part in the assassination of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image from DR Congo to describe this information .
the original fee , which last was taken on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here .
other news organizations , AF@@ P as their source , were also attributed to Th@@ an being attributed to this statement , but did not make the picture taken from DR Congo .
the world wide range of false data
traces of these false cou@@ plings only go back to the year 2011 and 2012 and actually come from all over the world .
using a &quot; reverse picture search &quot; you can see how far more information can be exceeded .
a reverse picture search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 3@@ 44 pictures ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) 3@@ 44 pictures , which are very similar to the written image of the DR Congo .
they come from a mixed mas@@ ks private sites , platforms of social media and social publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have for@@ warded the false reports , others have tried to un@@ mas@@ ked counter@@ f@@ eit@@ s .
we have bor@@ dered examples for the ab@@ used use and associated with the respective countries , based on which page they had been published . thus , we want to represent the range more clearly than by language alone .
from the listed countries ( which were also associated with each other in some cases ) can be used several examples of ab@@ u@@ sive use .
here are some cases that can now be felt completely up ( on the map in orange ) :
map : News Fr@@ ames .
examples of loc@@ ating false cou@@ plings of the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange countries indicate pages or servers , on the examples of for@@ f@@ eit@@ ing or false messages are still available .
the countries in grey are examples that are available according to metadata and information that are available via Tin@@ Eye , probably also counter@@ f@@ eit@@ ing examples .
as a memory , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Algeria , 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is happening in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a link to the image from DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Alg@@ erian and interested Arabs ) as part of a Th@@ reads to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; War of Budd@@ hist@@ s against Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

La Rep@@ ú@@ b@@ lica is quoted as its source the Spanish news agency EF@@ E ( where not known whether the original report has the image ) .
France , 2015 .
T@@ wit@@ ter@@ contributions after the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre , like this , who used the picture from the DR Congo to illustr@@ ate the &quot; atro@@ cities of Islam &quot; have seen clearly no pages like Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster , which refu@@ te this .

Malaysia , 2015 .
in addition , Malaysia offers two extreme examples for a ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from the DR Congo , with part of a blo@@ gger , and on the other hand a blo@@ gger , the claims , the Roh@@ ing@@ ya are persecuted , to del@@ ig@@ ate , since the photos were mis@@ used .

this post , which addressed to the members of the Russian Orthodox Church , clearly depic@@ ts that the picture of the DR DRC shows that Christians kill Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this news page claimed that the President of Myanmar Th@@ ein were involved in 2012 that mon@@ ks and politicians were involved in the killing of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims , and brought the story together with the image from San@@ ge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this release , the picture remains in it .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this article by students who had been killed by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the Catholic near the news page An@@ á@@ l@@ is@@ is Digital , has expressly stated that the picture is not of the killing , but it claims that it is a &quot; similar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; similar d@@ ship assault &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the picture was taken in connection with the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre of 2015 , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te that there were connections to Nigeria .
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ Dün@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria is burning , the world is sleeping ) .
the DR of the DR appeared , provided with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and dis@@ b@@ anded a discussion of Muslims following the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted to achieve that these communities were these events , which took over the name of the Islamic , a greater attention .
United States , 2015 .
the picture was wit@@ ched as a cover for the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times ) . but the messages that were associated with them were not taken up in any religious context .
instead , the goal was to judge attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage compared to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( USA ) , 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after a message that allegedly written by a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Father Juan Carlos Martos &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; written over the Nig@@ erian massacre , it was translated into circulation , like this one here in Vietnamese and declared it to fal@@ tering it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the Embassy in which the picture was included in the DR of Congo , the Clar@@ et@@ iner Mission@@ aries organisation and Father Juan Carlos Martos .
there are further confirmed examples of an incorrect use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
due to other accounts , generators and pages in the following countries ( on the portfolio in grey ) , Tin@@ Eye is also not trace@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the Web@@ cra@@ wler and disp@@ ose of images in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which only appeared clearly after the original accident of 2010 , the picture may ultimately be a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or available .
frames and pictures
there are two strong topics or frames ( frames ) that go through this post . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photo was used in relation to larger discussions about the silence in the context of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the mur@@ ders of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hist@@ s .
a second fr@@ aming uses the image to discuss how an African life is under@@ valued in comparison to a European or French life .
religion understand and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth to examine how images are used in connection with these efforts .
however , a deeper question is , however , what happens if readers can no longer have faith in these images .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with social media , there are people who are un@@ intended to have a stake in water around a tragedy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
suggests this mood of false and false information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and tast@@ ed it the real hor@@ ror of what actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the dis@@ semin@@ ation of massive pictures has been deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one argument is that the re@@ tention of pictures of a ref@@ usal is equivalent to recognize the tragedy . sometimes these pictures are even demanded by the victims themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , the concern is that violent images , readers and spect@@ ator , take the ability to emp@@ athy ( such as such study , which sought how for@@ cible media work to help others ) .
while there is a lot to discuss with violent represent@@ ations in the news media , fact is that they are essential for today &apos;s news coverage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Techn@@ ologist experiment with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ ake News &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; you will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something , which actually can be replaced by the context or completely ab@@ u@@ sive way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
every examination of incorrect de@@ preci@@ ation should also be considered internationally as international .

the &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo of Andy Simm@@ ons uses in accordance with CC BY @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e. g. im@@ measur@@ able ) tries to offer voice @-@ minded a selection of words from all over the world , which are difficult or not to translate .
these words are in every language : they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these irre@@ plac@@ eable words are already well known ( as the famous Portuguese sau@@ da@@ de ) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example , the Spanish so@@ bre@@ mes@@ a ) .
but all resist stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly every attempt of an easy translation .
a word or expression is not enough , which is why a complete explanation and sometimes a bit context are necessary to understand what is meant with this one word .
these unique words have been collected in an online list for quite a period of time .
most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to concentrate on small languages .
for example , in the blog , one finds words from the V@@ anu@@ at@@ u V@@ anu@@ at@@ u , such as :
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Bem@@ ba you for your parents in recognition of how to try yourself in your younger years .
and words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language that are spoken in parts of Brazil , as :
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The convenience or sl@@ oth you feel after having war@@ med yourself in the sun in cold days .
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words about his blog above :
they gr@@ ind other cultures , un@@ veil other thoughts and wake up our curiosity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes you influence what we want to analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this site or show more of these &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; im@@ measur@@ able &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are . &quot; &quot; &quot;
speakers of &quot; Treas@@ ure Languages , &quot; which are very appreciated by in@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favorite words here .

how Sri Lanka is dealing with the worst Fl@@ ut@@ kat@@ astrophe of the decade
the Sri Lanka island state looks at the moment the worst floo@@ ding and im@@ pregn@@ ation in this decade .
triggered by the mon@@ soon , usually ends at the end of May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , Gin , Nil@@ ag@@ a and Att@@ an@@ ag@@ alu O@@ ya in 15 bor@@ ou@@ ghs in the south and west of the country have stepped across the banks .
following a opinion of cat@@ astroph@@ ic Sri Lanka from May 28 , 2017 , 126 people were killed and nearly hundred people are missing because of the floods and sl@@ ur@@ ls .
more than 400 000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and approximately 100 000 people have been brought to 304 safe places of residence .
the rainf@@ all left on Saturday ( 27 May ) , and the waters in some areas went slowly .
health and hygiene conditions of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos con@@ vey an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :
floods in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water stands of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users such as A@@ zz@@ am Ame@@ en and Sri Lanka Twe@@ et offer regular updates to the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the catastrophe .
Sri Lan@@ kan le@@ thal floods , the Den@@ gu@@ ef@@ ie@@ ber@@ y crisis , warns Save the Children , after other rainf@@ alls are already on the way .
today the Nel@@ u@@ wa bus stood in floods , water level up to 6 meters . village of Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle also flooded the floods of Mor@@ og@@ o@@ da El@@ a .
the Air Force provided five air@@ planes for ambul@@ ances and further five are made available to transport of emergency supplies for the residents included in their flooded villages .
various organizations and start@@ ups have also agreed to help .
Facebook pages such as Help Flo@@ od V@@ IC@@ TI@@ MS in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood situation and humanitarian aid .
if any search and rescue teams are needed for their operations , please call the number 07@@ 7@@ 48@@ 44@@ 6@@ 39 .
for everyone who want to don@@ ate dry food and life @-@ necessary goods for flood victims -
today , we are in the area around Kel@@ en@@ i@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call the number 07@@ 77@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 07@@ 77@@ 84@@ 38@@ 41 if animals need help in this field .
the Tax@@ ir@@ uf @-@ App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their location data with the help of the app , so the Cat@@ ast@@ oph@@ en@@ entrum is informed .
last year after the disaster of the Trop@@ enst@@ ur@@ ms Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me introduced a &quot; high water remedy &quot; button to call it users to call for assistance from assistance services and donations . these were then for@@ warded to the sr@@ il@@ ank@@ ian Red Cross .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as well , they led a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SOS button &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to result in more than one thousand en@@ quiries and 150 successful boat @-@ ret@@ ali@@ ation actions for flood victims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the united efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , with which multiple social media platforms are fully at@@ ted , they bring people in need of security and afford assistance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this has prevented the loss of other human lives , with the population of Sri Lanka , the long way to restore norm@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the Women &apos;s March on January 21 , 2017 in San Francisco .
photo of Sa@@ ar Hab@@ ib G@@ ha@@ zi .
uti@@ liz@@ .@@ Dam@@ as in January I took part in Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and love friend .
I will trust her four years old daughter , she tru@@ sts me her children ; she is my rock in the surf .
in the one minute we call par@@ ol@@ es for women &apos;s rights .
in the next scale we will add rights to trans@@ gen@@ ders .
we are in a sea of umbre@@ llas and people , some keep the iconic picture of a woman with head@@ scarf high , bound from an American flag , other sk@@ in@@ ean par@@ ol@@ es against Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; These things are not concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslims ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I already led this conversation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people with whom I work or people who have known me for years , split me - the Sah@@ ar , which they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslims &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which has built up in their introduction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they don &apos;t want to destroy me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not see all the same .
we practice our religion differently .
we identify ourselves to be a Muslim but in different art . but somehow we all put in the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is designed in our collective idea that as soon as Muslims , they will not fit into it .
to become Muslim
I don &apos;t stand alone .
this even happened to the poet whose poetry is most sold in America : Rum@@ i .
what images will be in mind when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
when J@@ al@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Kor@@ an and Prophet Muhammad , were up to the day that he died , the centre of his poetry .
but in the Western not@@ ion religion Rum@@ is was obl@@ iter@@ ated , as is the most popular translations of his poetry .
this del@@ e@@ tion makes a major part of the history of 1,7 billion Muslims in this world .
another consists in the reduced images of Muslims , western books have been colon@@ ised for centuries .
this temp@@ ting language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman that you should save .
the pione@@ ering Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward Said performed the history behind these images in the 1970s .
but these pictures continue to rise further today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to dig@@ ni@@ fy them .
I have been working in the news industry for thir@@ teen years and I have seen how these powerful , incorrect nar@@ rati@@ ves domin@@ ate our news@@ feeds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this nar@@ rative is the reality that has led nine Muslim women in the last three decades , while the US could not even vote their first female presidential candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this nar@@ rative fails to recognize that if French , Muslim women are unable to bear their head@@ scarf in public buildings and to cover acid @-@ Arabic , Muslim women by their government to cover their entire body , which are both sides of the same coin .
a mighty group exercise its &quot; control &quot; to the &quot; others . &quot;
this strong nar@@ rative of Muslim women weak@@ ens the movements for change .
it looks over that the first Muslim prayers were spoken to American soil from Afri@@ cans who were taken with slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of Que@@ er Muslims .
this nar@@ rative has pro@@ found@@ ly occupied our collective imagination so that often S@@ ik@@ h men and children become in@@ tim@@ icro@@ li@@ mic attacks and ch@@ ic@@ an@@ ings .
because of these stories we tell and because of the way we tell it , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is today not only fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; others . &quot;
to the 1.7 billion
in the news industry we do more than just tell stories that are based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create nar@@ rati@@ ves that help us understand the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and my industry has already failed to capture the nar@@ rative of the 1.7 billion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims die in the highest degree &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; religious group in America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than one third of the entire Muslim population are African @-@ speaking Americans .
six of the ten American Muslims belong to the immigrants of the first generation coming from 77 countries .
the writer &apos;s parents in 1976 in New York .
use approved .
four decades ago , my immig@@ rated parents came to New York in order to live their American dream .
my mother put her first jewellery design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American St@@ atic of Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
back then , when Khan re@@ thinking the world &apos;s Sky@@ lines , my parents were indig@@ ent Muslims and Americans .
but am I now uncertain Muslims and Americans now ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , if I ask people why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of my Muslim recipes , I tell my hand@@ ker@@ chie@@ fs that all Muslims bear in themselves - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from respect to Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am jo@@ king , we do not carry all hand@@ ker@@ chie@@ fs with us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not need to be the@@ ological experts to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or to be selected for extra security checks at the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim schol@@ ars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists who ende@@ av@@ our to fight far widespread lies across Islam .
these lies are produced on the current band of a well @-@ lubri@@ cated Islam@@ opho@@ bia machine with money , think tanks and experts for fal@@ tering , which is our already faulty picture of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is manipul@@ ated .
because of the stories we tell and because of the way we tell it , Islam@@ opho@@ bia in more than just a stranger , who breaks out the head@@ scarf .
or as the fri@@ ghtening map of attacks on mos@@ ques in the whole of the USA , see below .
screen@@ shot of the AC@@ L@@ U website .
Islam@@ opho@@ bia in its ugly forms attack our affili@@ ation .
it attacks our identity , which is so far @-@ wide , so versatile and complex that it can be impossible to fit in a drawer .
the author 1986 on a photo of her kinder@@ garten group .
use approved .
I want to explain this .
I was born as a Muslim but was born in my imagination , but when I was four years old , in a provisional mosque in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
when social scientists describe religious life , they look back on the following terms : belief , behavior and belonging .
my Muslim faith and behaviour may not always be visible , but they are there .
maybe my girlfriend , my neighbour , my rock in the surf would see that I am Muslims when they could look through the 15 meters concrete and air that separate our houses .
she would see the ordinary ritual with my daughter when I shook her in my arms and called the Arab verses to protect the Kor@@ an and called the Q@@ uls .
every one of them I repeat three times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask that she is protected from evil , evil , that you can see and evil which you can &apos;t see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my Muslim faith is not always visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow .

use approved .
belonging to my grandmother is the image of my grandmother with her sisters ; as they win a competition by the art of flowers in Kar@@ achi for decades ago .
it &apos;s the picture of her that I &apos;ll see my eyes : Nano , surrounded by her finished paintings and un@@ finished paintings , Su@@ fi @-@ Holy ; and an Kor@@ an with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and four chapters , which it can be virtually impossible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Muslim means to speak the prayers they had said to me when I have a bad day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Muslims , as she taught me to relate to God , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Allah M@@ ian , what God means , my only Lord . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a people , which was founded - over centuries - by an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Empire &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which was founded by a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Imperi@@ um &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; company , it has a deep meaning , God , my only Lord . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the author 1987 with her grandfather .
use approved .
belonging to us means to grow up and to hear that men do not cry , but at the same time to see that my dar@@ ken@@ ed grandfather cri@@ es .
meanwhile , while he wrote books on the modern Islam and beyond the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir , N@@ ana Ja@@ an in@@ con@@ spir@@ ited to his family in India that he was not allowed to close his arms in half a century .
belonging to know that there are millions of Kurds and Palest@@ inians , whose families were torn apart from col@@ oni@@ alists , who have shared the Muslim world as the game risk .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim means to be known that Europeans have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; colonial countries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last two centuries of Europeans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it means to know that the first air@@ ship of the history was rejected by a Muslim country in a century ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it means to know that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , an Indian , recycled sub@@ tan by the British Empire , led by the newspapers of his time as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dangerous &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; since he led the first mosque in England . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even before it was air@@ planes , he travelled into more parts of the world than I ever was and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice .

to my Muslim tribe of 1,7 billion people go back deeply into our unforgettable family trees ; our un@@ plugged history .
it means that fourteen years ago , the most powerful military in the world , with troops that went over every continent apart from Antarc@@ tica , went into Iraq to pursue weapons of mass destruction that did not exist .
it means to know that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is buried under the tru@@ ff@@ ers of the war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an American Muslim means to know that suicide rate has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it means to know that if a tragedy meets the US and bears a Muslim name , the story takes four times more than a story with a white assass@@ in .
it means to know that fourteen years ago the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , was called Bil@@ al by a free black slave .
it means to know that two hundred years ago an African Islam@@ ist named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ l@@ aved and brought into this country .
it means to name Mal@@ col@@ m X a American hero .
it is the warmth that I feel when people crowded the airports to fight against Muslim Ban .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams and if we say black life .
an American woman , a Pak@@ ist@@ ani , a K@@ ah@@ ari , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ ab@@ i , a Muslim and a journalist means that inher@@ ent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our ident@@ ities , but to fail to fail them to communicate to others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the nar@@ rative of the 1.7 billion hides more ways than a magic cube , but is represented in the reduced doubt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be a mother , to make me care of my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged persons will er@@ ect to this branch of structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia is in the Muslim registry , which began with President Bush and were wi@@ dened by President Obama .
it consists of course monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it consists in the immigration agent , who takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child in wr@@ inkl@@ es .
it is in a country that exclu@@ des the borders of people from just the countries that are bom@@ bed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No @-@ Fly @-@ list &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is largely ignored by Arabs and Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are wars which we lead and the bombs we throw in Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because of the stories we tell and those who we don &apos;t tell , we are here today .
in a study of Asc@@ ent of Man , scientists of Nor@@ th@@ western University showed a scientifically un@@ true picture and desired them to assess groups on a scale of 1 to 100 concerning evolution .
Muslims received the least score .
the conversation that we have to guide
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are too deep that Muslim or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ab@@ dic@@ ate Muslim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we stand back for decades to recognize the roots of our fears and the fla@@ wed and dangerous prints , which we inter@@ fere in our news editorial . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims within the media industry , which tries to capture our multip@@ lic@@ ated ident@@ ities and forgotten history .
the pod@@ cast See Some@@ thing , Say Some@@ thing of Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the pod@@ cast # Good@@ Muslim Island ; Sap@@ el@@ o Square on black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Sch@@ ust@@ ler Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative to increase Muslim authors and Ms Mar@@ vel , the PA@@ K@@ IST@@ AN@@ IS@@ CH , Muslim , American Super@@ hero@@ ine - all this makes me hope .

but I am worried about this difficult global time in which we are in .
and this moment has consequences , which go beyond 1.7 billion .
there is a reason that conspi@@ racy the@@ or@@ ists existed in the dark corners of the Internet , now the White House .
they have grown exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally , because they have made Muslims to &quot; others . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is another group that has grown exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few years ago , they had not yet given them ; now they have large areas in Syria and Iraq .
I &apos;m worried about the real@@ ities and history that I was not aware of when I was so old now , as I did my daughter now , but that made me to a controversial Muslim .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; things I left here like a bread@@ crum@@ b track in my speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
things that might aw@@ aken memories , because in all the inter@@ section that makes our humanity a story l@@ ur@@ k , where someone is made to another . &quot;
right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , con@@ vers@@ ations take place within the 8th Annual Conference of Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
more than a hundred ac@@ adem@@ ics talk about our problems with the &quot; others , &quot; structural rac@@ ism &quot; and &quot; American Mil@@ itar@@ ism . &quot;
these are not any terms , with whom we usually read in our schools or read our newspapers in our newspapers .

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; why do I tell that here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward Said , who has shown us how wars are being led and supported by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the public performance four decades ago , I was a scientist of Stan@@ ford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we must make ourselves un@@ comfortable questions about the role of being aware and un@@ consci@@ ously the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the role of being aware and un@@ consci@@ ously the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because the employment that we feed ourselves a new future , in which we have no presi@@ dents , the chocolate cake , and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other made &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people bombs , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for nar@@ rative art will preserve urban language variety
stor@@ y@@ telling , by Flickr user Daniele Rossi , using the CC BY @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 license .
can there be a possibility , here and now , despite a language barrier with anyone else ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Perry , founder of the Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) initiative is a possible answer to stories in their original language .
global Vo@@ ices reported recently about a different initiative of Steven Bird , the im@@ measur@@ able blog .
however , here the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written word , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to obtain the language variety of major cities .
in fact , in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in O@@ ak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has already performed events since 2015 , the risk that small and not quite as little languages will not be shared by the children born there .
for the makers of the project is :
mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided if we accept cities - safe spaces in which inhabitants do not need to forget who they are to belong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listen frequently , these events instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be understood instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to appreciate , to feel , to establish , to establish , &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format , stor@@ y@@ t@@ ellers introduce their story in their own language and translate , or explain them in English .
even if the participants are not a professional stor@@ y@@ t@@ ellers , their dev@@ otion and visu@@ alization will lead to the audience .
they call to laugh and emotions , as if the language is no longer a barrier .
the following video shows a traditional story of Burkina Faso , which is told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the stor@@ y@@ t@@ eller Ras@@ si@@ dat@@ ou Con@@ ate also takes the opportunity to explain the nar@@ rative of the nar@@ rative of nar@@ rative art .
in another event John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the be@@ ak of the rab@@ bits and the P@@ avi@@ an in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
&quot; &quot; &quot; after he explains the meaning of his F@@ abel , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is asked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How is this to speak to an audience , which does not understand your language ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he shares his sense of in@@ firm@@ ity : &quot; &quot; &quot;
you have heard !
they were attentive ...
they were all with me !
so far , the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities , and the organiz@@ ers hope to expand this . all that are inspired by the project can be in contact with T@@ LS in order to organize their own stories .
Puerto Rico calls for the US re@@ organisation of the state debt
with the aim of a re@@ examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico , numerous religious and civil organizations involved in a mass demonstration . the march started with the pu@@ ertor@@ ik@@ an Capitol , the town building of the capital , and went up to the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ ans .

the people of Puerto Rico demands that politicians , banks and government agencies , responsible for the debts , are responsible for their corruption .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for financial examination and a tap committee without personal interests in public debt , with a fixed , our work conditions , which is in favour of the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are ex@@ pressed and supp@@ ressed .
the people of Puerto Rico is ref@@ using to pay a debt that is not thei@@ rs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pension@@ ers will not take away with sin@@ king payments .
we demand immediate measures .
the island - not in the State of the United States - is suffering under a heavy financial crisis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Center for New Economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a regulated non @-@ profit organization without party affili@@ ation with focus on soci@@ o@@ economic development , a law for state responsibility , as an alternative to the existing state view . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Rico requires a wide restructuring of governmental infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; imposed on the outside will run without the participation and convic@@ tion of the citizens of danger to be rejected by the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the Syrian web developer Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bas@@ sel Saf@@ adi , has been missed for over a year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and family re@@ comp@@ ose the campaign for his freedom and remind of the contributions which he did for an open network .
at this year &apos;s re : public@@ a , the annual conference of digital culture , which is al@@ igned in Berlin , dedicated to the event of the # Free@@ Bas@@ sel Campa@@ ign .
Mé@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist of the German @-@ based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , Managing Director of Book Spr@@ ints , a publishing house published by so @-@ called &apos; Book Spr@@ ints &apos; ready books within three to five days , read excer@@ pts from the Book of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive In@@ signia ( The Cost of Freedom : a collective replica ) .
the book published last year has been released and licensed freely , contains a number of essays that deal with free culture in the face of the op@@ pression .
it is a homage to Bas@@ sel and his work .
in the introduction , it reads :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this book would like to discuss how movements for free knowledge will be built and what the real costs are linked to which this is related . &quot; &quot; &quot;
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers , researchers , researchers , researchers and authors who have been involved in the movements of free knowledge have to look over the fog that surro@@ unds our news@@ feeds and to create some sense from our different experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated internet volunteers , who has been detained in Syria since 15 March 2012 .
his name was painted from the A@@ dra prison directory in which he sat on October 3 , 2015 .
since then , we have no information about its current state or residence .
the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice to push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom , instantly .
to see how Bas@@ sel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us begin to think about their own fate , deeds and decisions .
why Are We Here ?
what did we choose ?
what have we abandoned in this process of time of extreme convic@@ tions ?
the web developer for Open Source and digital activ@@ ist has been in custody for Syrian government authorities since March 2012 .
in October 2015 Bas@@ sel was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution , to an unknown location .
his wife , the writer and lawyer , N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi , reported that the &quot; Military Police Bas@@ sel entered the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; commander of the military court of his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
G@@ ha@@ zi reported that she was cont@@ acted by persons on 12 November 2015 , which presented himself as a Insider of the Assad government and put them in knowledge of an alleged death sentence against her husband .
but its position and condition remain unknown .
a pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bas@@ sel played a crucial role in which access to the internet and knowledge for the around public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and at the moment the director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bas@@ sel , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of the bass prototypes were looking ahead as the work that he began with a group of ar@@ che@@ ologists and 3D artists around the year 2005 to re@@ build the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ra .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the destination of many civilians and mer@@ ging gre@@ ek @-@ Roman architecture types with hi@@ es@@ igen traditions and Persian influences .
Bas@@ sel could not know that ten years after he began to work with this work , the IS was going to put everything that is not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world .
this mat@@ uring into the digital archae@@ ology and the preserv@@ ation has created a tim@@ eline , which will be inv@@ alu@@ able in the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
trag@@ ically , Bas@@ sel could not finish this project yet .
N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi has also contributed to the book and writes about her husband &apos;s passion , his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I have spent my whole life to dream of freedom and taught me to embrace them .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bas@@ sel brought me English , even when he was already in jail .
I have learned to read and speak English good , write and speak English .
he has always shared his knowledge with each one who asked . he has taught others to read and speak English .
Bas@@ sel opened my door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he taught me the Internet .
he also taught other agents such as computers , at least theoretical , without knowing they had in their hands .
G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a proxy that she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 when he was in custody .
Bas@@ sel and N@@ oura have worked together in the book for a year .
they s@@ mu@@ g@@ gled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated them out from the Arab to English .
the book is licensed freely .
book covers by Youssef Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to public domain .
here is an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a with the title &quot; It happens &quot; :
it happens every visit ,
that I fail in the world of your ench@@ anting eyes ,
that I lose the reflection in the moment we embrace .
that every haz@@ ards does not matter ,
each of the f@@ ences , fet@@ ters and guards
I forget the prison thought of the prison
and I will sing in every detail of your voice and words
who I carry with passion for me ,
when your eyes fail to say
and I will leave another piece of my soul with you ...
I return quickly to my lon@@ el@@ iness ,
to fet@@ ch all the moments ,
and to cry and smile on your absence .
I bear witness to myself , that I will return soon ...
on the first anniversary of the detention of Bas@@ sel , G@@ ha@@ zi wrote :

and you are still in the cage of monsters
the story is not unique in Syria .
since the beginning of the protests against Bash@@ ar al @-@ Ass@@ ads in 2011 , according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian network for Human Rights ) , more than 65@@ ,000 people disappeared .
those who were arrested or imprisoned under violence by the regime were tor@@ tured or even executed .
until 2016 , the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International died at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians in prison since 2011 .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices Community has been calling for the release of Bas@@ sel since 2012 .
today , we repeat our demand in hope that we have to do this for the last time .
Mozambique : sentenced to previous post due to corruption by corruption .
Mos@@ ambique re@@ acted with anger on a corruption incident , where a government member returned to the workplace in the state of the State of the State .
this is the Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza , which was arrested in 2008 and in 2010 together with four other def@@ endants were sentenced to 22 years imprisonment together with four other def@@ endants ( approximately 800 000 Euro ) .
the money came from public funds of Mozambique by the Council of Cam@@ b@@ aza , between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ b@@ aza was released in 2016 for good guided tour and immediately called for his return to the company , what happened on April 19th .
in accordance with the At@@ tor@@ ney General &apos;s Office of the Republic , which granted the application , there would be no obst@@ acle reason for Cam@@ b@@ aza , because the company had no discipline in custody after his imprisonment .
however , many people do not leave the action well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the centre for public integrity ( Centro de Inte@@ gri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , short C@@ IP ) , a local institution responsible for public transparency in an interview with Deutsche Welle , condemned the company &apos;s decision to establish the director again : &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and clari@@ fy the lack of transparency and is even a step towards the efforts of our legal system , such as the C@@ IP . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what we think is that the company should have a disciplinary method to oppos@@ e an oppos@@ ing authority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the firm seems , however , and caused no reasonable legal steps for the application of the respective functions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Muslim social media , re@@ jects this behavior and considers the case as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contradic@@ tory &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Cam@@ b@@ aza would be a competent guy , he would be consultant after he was sentenced to prison and half of them had to eat .
he could have paid lectures and motiv@@ ating words , he could advise and pol@@ ate his image .
but as he is in@@ competent , he has authorized to be integrated into the company , which he helped damage harm .
therefore , it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ aza is to be paid for his silence .
contradic@@ tory !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mos@@ ambi@@ ance and student of political science in Brazil , says the director no moral :
Cam@@ b@@ aza was rewarded by the State because he ins@@ ulted him , I can &apos;t believe that someone has rewarded someone in such a way that the state has already been so mas@@ sively ins@@ ulted .
Cam@@ b@@ aza lack the mor@@ ality and serve the state , * He had already served a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead only served by the state .
Cam@@ b@@ aza used the state , as hand@@ ing it has become an in@@ exhau@@ st@@ ible money source and the state itself is we@@ ary of this man , who was pre @-@ loaded and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence .
hon@@ est@@ ly , I don &apos;t know why this man was rewarded .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te is preferred to remember the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , remember that a thief belongs to the prison :
th@@ ie@@ ves belong to the prison Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el will not only remain in memory for ever and as a first independent president , but also as a sharp , l@@ apping and - next door - prophe@@ tic speakers .
one of his most famous oral represent@@ ations was , as he affir@@ med , that &quot; an ambitious person is capable of being able to sell his amb@@ itions for his amb@@ itions , his own individual interest . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sam@@ ora also said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious person is changing , my experience shows that this is not so . he changes the tactics , but he does not change his amb@@ itions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a more ambitious person is a crime . &quot;
in Twitter the reactions were also le@@ aning :
Cam@@ b@@ aza was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he sat down 10 years and came free .
and today it is pushing him by the company where he de@@ file Gel@@ der , again under the contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ OM@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - я@@ α@@ em@@ itted ( @ az@@ mal _ Raf@@ ik ) 12 May 2017

Facebook blocked the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cen@@ sored many users wron@@ g@@ ly
the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means K@@ ich@@ er@@ erb@@ se or don@@ or .

according to data from Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network adopted its post from the network because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; although the origin of the word is still more discussed , it is usually used to refer to people ost@@ indi@@ an origin or generally used as an ad@@ jective . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook is the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( in Bur@@ m@@ ese writing ) as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of the H@@ ass@@ language in Burma in the social network . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent years , the ascent of radical nation@@ alistic movements has given the word an extremely ab@@ rup@@ tive con@@ notation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by Ultra nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims who represent a minority of population in Myanmar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in an effort to fight hyst@@ er@@ cial in Myanmar , the company has cen@@ sored a lot of meaningful content on its platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos; may normally be associated with rac@@ ism , but the word itself does not call itself automatically .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that post@@ s , in which they have discussed the use of the word or doubt have doubts the use of his use .
there are several bur@@ ial words with fundamental mean@@ ings , which have the same letter as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , it is written on Bur@@ m@@ ese too &apos; Kal@@ ar ht@@ a@@ ing &apos; which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( sp@@ age ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ at &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ar@@ k@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ ky A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at declared the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a post of one of my friends has been deleted today , because he contained the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he asked his friends on spiritu@@ ally what she knew how he could re@@ lie@@ ve his back pain as he made an Word game .
the phrase ku la - &quot; healing &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - re@@ sembles the rac@@ ist expression very , but the context is completely different .
there were various reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
Z@@ in Win H@@ aving is the opinion that she will reduce H@@ ass@@ pron@@ unci@@ ation of radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook will be analy@@ tic , before it del@@ etes all post@@ ings to spread rac@@ ism .
Facebook does not delete the word &quot; Kal@@ ar . &quot;
it filters the word automatically .
the automation will not understand what you write on Fac@@ be@@ ook .
what it should be done instead , check the post carefully and check it by checking the above words .
for example &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; ( age range ) .
the good thing is that these three @-@ story nation@@ alists , spread to hate , get a pretty good lesson .
now it is time to circumc@@ ise its nation@@ alism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the action may send a strong signal to all , the H@@ ass@@ language is spreading , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have often proved a cat@@ ch@@ - and mouse game , whereby users of social networks will simply start to use a new word or alternative sp@@ elling of the cen@@ sored word to express their views . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook began to clear his post@@ s when he only wanted to tell his friends , that the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is banned from social network : &quot; &quot; &quot;
... as I was aware of this new directive on Facebook , I made a post to share my Facebook friends that the word is locked .
ir@@ on@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and it was forbidden to use the li@@ ken , post and parts of content for 24 hours , because the post &quot; Facebook community standards did not end . &quot;
Facebook has a lot of postcards removed from people who have no negative inten@@ tions , or who simply try to show their opinions against the H@@ ass@@ umes radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed , which has nothing to do with pron@@ unci@@ ation :
post without H@@ ass@@ ay from Facebook .
in the post , the author shared his opinion of why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism are bad in the country .
Chan My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese internet community ask for advice :
Facebook likes to have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to decrease rac@@ ism in Burma through their platform , but it doesn &apos;t work .
such words are to c@@ ens@@ or even more hatred within the different communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , it seems as if they have started this without a local context or technical support and thus have been forbidden as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even when they found out that they made mistakes , they tried not to review the wron@@ g@@ ly deleted post@@ s .
if they had only some respect for the 15 million benefits , they had a great turnover , it would be great .
fac@@ ebooks automatic c@@ ens@@ orship had cat@@ ered for a lot of don@@ ating among users .
instead of taking serious , users can now go through Facebook and consci@@ ously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; in the context of H@@ ass@@ in to see whether their post@@ s are taken from the net .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook post@@ ings , which have no hyst@@ er@@ cial language , but still removed :
with permission used .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text is &quot; I want to sit on a chair and watch a pe@@ at cur@@ ry and watch an Indian film .
only to try out if Facebook contains the mail , which contains the word Kal@@ ar . &quot;

the post says &quot; If you are a doctor , do you cure people ? &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists who have used social networks to extend their voices and influence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among other things , H@@ ass@@ le is to reduce violence in Myanmar in social networks , especially in the field of Rak@@ h@@ ine , where disputes between Muslims and Budd@@ hist@@ s have forced thousands to escape .
Facebook was critic@@ ised for his failure to susp@@ end the balancing act on his Bur@@ m@@ ese pages under control .
but instead of just typ@@ ing the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better getting closer to context than on code concentrated initiatives and learned from them .
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tobago is at the end with the children before
a wedding ring in the sand .

the children before is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago now .
on 9 June 2017 , the country of the country unanim@@ ously decided to offer which this practice is to offer , so that the age of marriage is now 18 .
prior to this amend@@ ment of the Act Law , a number of members of religious and Muslim communities were gathered in practice , and in May 2016 , brother Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ad Mahar@@ aj was gathered to the leaders of the various religious groups of the country , that the state had not inter@@ fere with the state , since that , age is not the maturity . &quot;
this happened , regardless of the fact that Trinidad and Tobago has a contractual partner of the UN Children &apos;s Rights Day , the min@@ ors as defined as every human being under 18 years of age . &quot;
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children who had been married to 15 percent in Trinidad and Tobago amounted to 2.8 percent , and with 18 were 8.1 percent .
in 2011 , the statistical central office of the country confirmed that from 1997 @-@ 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19 .
online pet@@ itions and social media movements , which were ende@@ av@@ oured to abol@@ ish laws on child before , followed by the foot and rejo@@ iced support . without doubt they helped bring about this result .
nevertheless , not everything went smoothly .
a Hindu leader , for example , had no concerns to say the critics of the children before they ought to take care of their own affairs . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of religious opposition sort of ten@@ sions in this actually in@@ intri@@ c@@ ate matter , and some doubts came to doubt whether the opposition would agree to the bill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but at the beginning of 2017 the bill was decided against the children before - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the Opposition and an independent , which was ab@@ stain@@ ed , so that he could be discussed at the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , where a simple majority would take him to the law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now only the President of the country has to agree and release the law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators gave a status update on Facebook , which read Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ agram again :
Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence R@@ amb@@ har@@ at : the bill was approved in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives with 35 votes and not a single decision .
after being decided in the Senate , the draft can now become a law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the majority of social media users were thrilled , because the laws were finally changed before the child . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , who was a minist@@ erial office in the Ministry of Education , said :
it has too much time and unnecessary talk , that has ve@@ iled the core of the thing , but know what ? the children before is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago now and that is worth every price .
while Abel was the opinion of Abel , it was definitely long enough to abol@@ ish the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was happy that the day had finally arrived :
new status update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , who says : News , Excell@@ ent News !
the law law has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for that - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
fol@@ ate Mut@@ ota , who listened to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society which was quite openly about how important the adoption of the law was , noted :
the age of marriage in Trinidad and Tobago is now independent of religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
the draft on the amend@@ ment of the Act was approved today , on June 9 , 2017 .
there are 41 members in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , and 35 of them were present at the vote .
all de@@ pu@@ ties that were against , agreed to the law .
the children before is legally permitted in Trinidad and Tobago .
it was a long struggle ( ... ) # child@@ mar@@ ri@@ age@@ views .
many thanks to all activists who have focused on him .
congratulations .
thanks to our de@@ pu@@ ties .
but a possible hit@@ ch comes in the form of Sat Mahar@@ aj , therefore the Secretary General of San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hindu organisation of the country .
months ago , Mahar@@ aj has announced his intention to undertake judicial steps should be adopted , and he seems to be able to rede@@ em his promise .
while the General At@@ tor@@ ney of Paris Al ra@@ wi , a advoc@@ ate of the law , said it was quite legally , if Mahar@@ aj was going against the law , most social media users wished , the debate would be different on the subject .
Patricia Wor@@ rell suggested :
dear Sat , if we , instead of having to cause the debate so commonly in a way that we would say , instead of the problem , that the state , our daughters from it , protect them from big , stub@@ born hus@@ bands that are mis@@ used to them , would you be ready to continue the discussion ?
or do you believe it is not a problem ?
however , if it comes to a judicial proceedings against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where the children are legal in different gra@@ d@@ ations legal or still the norm , although there are laws they submit .

a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform made all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ cent@@ ered pe@@ er @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network , which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete c@@ ens@@ orship difficult .
the content is however call@@ able in spite of legal prohibition .
in a blog post , IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
after we have heard the news ( about the lock on Wikipedia ) , we set everything to disable snapshots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , the possibility of reading the content on dec@@ entr@@ alized and distributed way .
this can help users to view at least any Wikipedia contents , even if they cannot reach the www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.org website .
IP@@ FS also proved that this step was carried out independently of the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is only about screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wik@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to avoid the lock .
Crist@@ ian Con@@ son@@ ni of Wik@@ im@@ edia Italy , a mirror site from Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that everyone can use to host similar mirrors , when in the respective country , Wikipedia is blocked .
Con@@ son@@ ni reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi - Global Vo@@ ices member and staff at Mozilla in Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi &apos;s Open speaks &quot; Podcast :
there is no complete copy of a proxy address , a mirror .
you are access@@ ing a different URL , which is not the original . that which one sees is from Wikipedia .
essentially , the server runs on the request to the right Wikipedia page , so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia even if these are locked in Turkey .
for this is done by a server that is not in Turkey .

with permission used .
Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was with the photos that he looked around , never satisfied . they were bl@@ ur@@ red with badly positioned mot@@ if@@ s and washed colours .
that motiv@@ ates him to carry a camera for himself , and try to dig@@ ni@@ fy the situation .
back then he was a child .
today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar tries to bring to the international stage as an animal world .
and his hometown directly next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , it offers the perfect opportunity to shoot photos which focus the attention to Nep@@ alese wildlife .
he described on Facebook like this top @-@ class situation in his work helps :
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! !
I just rested at home when I called Navar@@ aj ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) . he had received a call from my father that on the banks of the Rap@@ ti River a le@@ op@@ ard would be .
the river dam@@ m is just a few minutes from the tourist town of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father had watched him and showed me the place on the other river side , where the le@@ op@@ ard was and I immediately started to kn@@ it pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar stri@@ ves to collabor@@ ate with the authorities to obtain worldwide recognition for Nep@@ als Nature and wants to deep@@ en understanding that wild animals are not as terri@@ fying as they look like .
and he should know it , because he was the tiger already from face to face :
a tiger can &apos;t inter@@ fere with the opinion of sheep anymore ! !
late in the evenings . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
I was also because of darkness on the way home , when suddenly the king of the book appeared . he immediately continues to see us and he star@@ es me through the Sal Tre@@ es ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar placed the logo &quot; I click for Conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) to his photos .
however , his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ als nature and wild animals , however , is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days , and lived in a tent in order to take pictures from Ot@@ ters . up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds , which live near the tourist information .
look below some of these photos .

years after the marriage there were Indian women to talk about their hus@@ bands &apos; names .

this post was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and originally published on video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international media organization from India .
a revised version was again published as part of a content sharing agreement .
in many parts of India , there are women with the greatest care to express the name of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
instead , they use a pre@@ stige or say &quot; Father of my child . &quot;
from Ch@@ hatt@@ is@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h to respect women that they should respect the husband due to the social pressure , as well as the fear of the consequences , they should respect the norm in life .
last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was convicted by a head@@ light court and rep@@ udi@@ ated by her family and the village community after they had addressed a married relatives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tradition also does not call their wives by name , it is also common among men . however , they have far less adher@@ ence to fear , if any , they should not follow this practice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the small village of Wal@@ he in the P@@ une district , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health professionals and house@@ wives , a unique club and became fast to the main subject of the city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a place only for them alone , to discuss and discuss the del@@ icacy of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when one of 56 clubs found in 13 Indian states , he is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which is operated by the Community Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and relies on the mining of Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ist has been working for seven years with the help of their video camera on the cover of practices , such as children &apos;s homes up to the exile of H@@ IV@@ - and AIDS infected .
she tells us how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and they simultaneously made them to bot@@ ox inside the wall .
the first video , the Roh@@ ini showed in their discussion round , acted by women who do not call their hus@@ bands on behalf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she decided on this topic , because she wanted to talk about the patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem with which women can easily identify themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the names of their hus@@ bands do not speak lou@@ dly , it is a Br@@ auch , which they end@@ owed all light and never have question@@ ed question@@ ed .
Roh@@ ini means :
this tradition test@@ i@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him long life .
a woman who doesn &apos;t stand this , is regarded as a cra@@ f@@ ist , as a woman without moral .
tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never made thought about this discussion round .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini wanted her husband to have never named her name at home , trying to try out how it runs .
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband are silent for a long time after the video was finished .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pra@@ k@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I should name him from now on his name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage of Roh@@ ini started their first discussion .
many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; never before . some believed that it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , were protected .
at the beginning of the lap , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem at U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection the women tried to bring discussion with a practice .
Roh@@ ini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , upset , sad , loving and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then she asked them all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If we can &apos;t say the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us what they want , means that they should not respect us ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
should it not be equivalent ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day in which they brought the name of their hus@@ bands on their lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ c over the course of a century @-@ old tradition , in which women married the name of their hus@@ bands .
Roh@@ ini tells :
one woman was so shy , that during the whole exercise only be@@ amed around ; another decided to release the whole fru@@ str@@ ated fru@@ stration against him and his family by cursed him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
even in the adren@@ alin rush to have broken with an old custom , the women decided that they would actually try to call their hus@@ bands on behalf .
and they kept their word .
in the coming days Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas they put to women in his head : his wife could not stop to say his name .
another club member decided to do it during dinner before the entire family .
when she was her mother @-@ in @-@ mother , she was afraid , and said that it was a mistake .
another woman said , &quot; Roh@@ ini said I should do it . &quot;
a husband of a participant in less understanding was less understanding and the situation art@@ ed in violence .
Roh@@ ini reports how women have attempted to stop other practices , such as wearing the cin@@ ogenic red dot on the forehead , which indicates the sp@@ inal status :
why do women only have to show that they are married ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said to my husband that I would carry the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red point if he would do it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he laughed at only and I was listening to carry him .
the other women didn &apos;t stop it completely , but I think they are now in a better position to choose it , not to wear it in some days .
for many women , the discussion l@@ b is a safe place where they can share their opinions and goals .
&quot; we are doing a trip for each discussion .
normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to worry about women who could hear what could hear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last months , they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes ; they danced , and spoke about things about which they had never thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for many years and yet I have said about some things , for example like our ident@@ ities of our hus@@ bands , have never been so hon@@ est@@ ly spoken .
it feels great to say certain things loud , no matter how small they occur .
in a discussion round , we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothing .
some women in the group have carried only Sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most , this is okay , but some people wanted to carry a Sal@@ man @-@ Kur@@ ta , a vast shirt over a pants , but they didn &apos;t get married .
after a lot of dispute and discussion about the advantages of their own coat @-@ selection , mor@@ ality is related to the sar@@ is and much more , g@@ nat@@ ched Roh@@ ini her own pair of Kur@@ tas ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) in a discussion round so that women were able to carry them .
next , they have decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a where they can wear je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is sure that they will be able to create it .
on the question of whether in the five months of their first discussion , Roh@@ ini confirmed that things happen slowly to the rolls :
so far we have made little steps so far .
some women tested it a few times , but then they listened to say their husband &apos;s name .
some , including me , make it still , but only when they are alone and no other family members .
only one or two will continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now wear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red on their forehead .
the women in discussion will know that the changes that they want to achieve in their lives - like the fen@@ cing around more freedom of movement or their own clos@@ ets - at the end of a hard to navigate the river .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each one of us is a victim of Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am also there .
but this club gives everyone of us confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction if every woman goes home and told other people about what we are talking about and what we do .
we are all sitting in the same boat .

and as it belongs to fans , Japanese also make pilgri@@ m@@ ages to the well @-@ known places that are related to the band .
when you love The Beatles , you are the 5 places that you must definitely visit .

a new system of kidn@@ apping of gl@@ itter@@ ing persons for organ trading , probably for aber@@ st@@ itious purposes , the police force of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government now called a number of operations into life to stop the Pra@@ k@@ tics .
at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the Mil@@ k district , a few kilometres from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims was found and part of the organs were removed .
two men were arrested and they stood in the row that the organs of Sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi are being used .
there are the local super@@ st@@ ition that the head of a bald man of gold could be given to gold or wealth , the police spokes@@ man of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia , the BBC .
it is the first time that succ@@ essive attacks were registered in Mozambique .
another group , the aim of mur@@ ders for obsc@@ ure purposes are people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to the UN in SA to explore a mission in the South African country to investig@@ ate this practice .
the persecution of people with Al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in neighbouring Tanzania , where the government of campaigns were developed to fight these super@@ st@@ ition and pre@@ judi@@ ce .
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the city of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who prefer to travel to the country :
attention to k@@ ah@@ le men who are in Mozambique are the target of ritual attacks , war@@ med the Muslim police after the latest murder of three gl@@ itter@@ ing men based on their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ k , where the murdered people were arrested .
Hus@@ sen@@ e Lag@@ y Ad@@ amo , student and residents of the town of In@@ ham@@ b@@ ane in the south of Mozambique said that the local police had already entered the case :
PR@@ M believes that the sh@@ am@@ ans are involved in the death of bald men .
the persecution and murder of gl@@ itter@@ ing individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ ca@@ bal@@ a , has been commissioned by the traditional sh@@ am@@ ans , which also exists from the traditional sh@@ am@@ ans , which also exist by the traditional sh@@ am@@ ans , according to which the victims had existed in the head of power , the riches of wealth .
in the last days , three men with hair loss problems were murdered in this part of the country .
on Facebook , Angela Fer@@ re@@ ira Sam@@ an@@ tha divided the chron@@ icle of the Blo@@ ggers arms Sn@@ ai@@ ppa , which clearly stated that the problem is part of the larger social difficulty of which Mozambique is opposite :
I would like to ask GER@@ NE E@@ IN Mos@@ ambi@@ k , TH@@ AT S@@ ME , in which the teachers would have sh@@ amed up on the road and others would not hurt men to make their bread , a country in which neither the Al@@ bin@@ os become ch@@ ased or &quot; black magic &quot; that aim to move to fast wealth .
despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some may have the opportunity for mac@@ ab@@ ing humor .
Zen@@ aida Mach@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Mozambique and enthusiastic Twitter users , twe@@ et@@ ted that both the chief of the district of Mor@@ ov@@ bal@@ a , Pedro Sap@@ ange , as well as the police pre@@ cher Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zi@@ as , In@@ á@@ cio D@@ ina , both gl@@ atz@@ kö@@ ping are :

a photo of Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Liu X@@ ia , which probably was made recently .
this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of imprisoned Chinese dis@@ si@@ dents Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has drawn attention to the international community , after his lawyer had been announced at the end of June that he has been hosp@@ itali@@ zed due to liver canc@@ ers in the hospital .
in 2009 , Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( so@@ vereign debt ) , after having responded to the design of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o that claims the democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China has referred to Li@@ us case as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an internal thing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a speaker tells , he said it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yet China is still receiving calls from the international community to allow Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate and his wife , po@@ ets of Liu X@@ ia , or allow him to permit treatment abroad .
while some countries have critic@@ ised the strict treatment of Pa@@ ares in Beijing , others are completely exhausted .
Hong Kong Free Press has sum@@ med up some reactions from abroad .
United Nations
Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met at the end of June Chinese civil servants to discuss the case of Liu .
however , a speaker refused to comment whether the United Nations should ex@@ ert pressure to enable Liu in foreign countries .
Norway
Norway &apos;s prime minister in Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende have refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
the relationship between China and Norway came to Sto@@ cks after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu in 2010 , although the Norwegian government announced that it ultimately decided nothing to do with the decision .
the diplomatic relations were continued until December last year . only in June , Norway signed an agreement to res@@ ume the salmon trip to China , as the exports had been mostly blocked since 2010 .
after the message has spread that Liu was seriously ill , the Nobel committee was hoping for an un@@ conditional release to the expression and invited Liu to get his prize in Oslo .
due to his arrest , he was unable to gain his price .
Liu was represented by an empty chair during the ceremony .
European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a resolution on which China was asked to deliver Liu and his wife immediately from house arrest and allow him to seek emergency medical support , where he wants .
the leading diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mog@@ her@@ ini , also called for the release of Li@@ us for the release of Li@@ us in a statement on 30 June :
at the same time , we expect China to raise all constra@@ ints of Mr Li@@ us wife as well as family members .
they should meet and receive all visits you want , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
United States
us ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad told him that the Americans asked him that he had the opportunity to treat the treatment abroad , if it was to him for his recovery . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an spokes@@ woman in the US Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the message that the Chinese authorities refused to release Liu X@@ ia of her house arrest but also his wife Ms. Liu X@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the invitation of the US Embassy with@@ drew a fur@@ ious answer from China according to the Foreign Ministry of Foreign Affairs , that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no country has the right to inter@@ fere and make ir@@ responsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pol@@ ley told that China should offer the couple the following :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; protection and freedom like freedom of travel and access to the medical supplies of his choice , to which they claim according to Chinese constitution and legal systems as well as international obligations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and Ted Cruz also introduced a resolution on the Congress to push the Chinese government to un@@ condition@@ ally release Liu and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally .
I urge China to release the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o un@@ condition@@ ally un@@ condition@@ ally allow himself in proper medical treatment . htt@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany
&quot; &quot; &quot; on July 3 , Berlin , the German government spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote that Liu &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; receives all the medical support he needs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanitarian solution for Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chinese President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping appeared on the G20 summit in Hamburg on 7 and 8 July .
previously , diplomatic sources reported in Beijing of the news agency Reuters that China had big concerns whether the vor@@ tex could allow Liu &apos;s visit to Hamburg .
Canada
on 28 June , the Canadian ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um China called on to provide Liu an adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to let him take care of his family .
Li@@ us attorney told AF@@ P before that Li@@ us woman , Liu X@@ ia could visit him every day , but the police always monitors the room in the hospital and that it is not allowed to speak with anyone outside , including his lawyers to speak and contact .
Mc@@ Call@@ um continues :
Canada calls for China to uph@@ old his international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , and for the exercise of these rights .
France
the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs urged China to release Liu from humanitarian reasons :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all the treatments that he needs , regardless of where needed . furthermore , his wife and his family have been in contact with him .
although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that France will not give any further information if France would ultimately absorb it .
Taiwan
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of commemor@@ ative affairs in Taiwan called on June 27 to release Liu and demand a major tolerance towards those who want to use peaceful funds to demand political reforms and democratic development . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legisl@@ ator Yu Me@@ i @-@ nu also challenged China to allow intellec@@ tu@@ ally intellectual Liu to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , showed herself on June 28 at Liu very worried and gave that many have asked him to pray for Li@@ us well being .
he said about Liu :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is my belief that he took and for whom he had been strictly punished to a harmon@@ ic , more stable and wealthy China , which would have contributed to a more peaceful world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I felt personally moved and encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellec@@ tu@@ als and affected citizens , inspired by Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , the Charter 08 signed , destined for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may appear dum@@ b , since Singapore is recognized as an independent state as an independent state .
but according to the Minister of Justice K. Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am , Singapore should be considered as a town .
this remark has triggered a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the State Bar in New York , the Minister , that many people critic@@ ised the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared to Singapore in other countries .
he supported that Singapore should be considered a city .
... No one has question@@ ed whether New York is a democracy ...
that is , most people go a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we might be different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blog Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; turn the logic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then , after all our efforts and sacrific@@ ed to create this valuable country , one hears that we ultimately could not be a country .
it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of an escape before the responsibilities , a bre@@ ach of duty .
Singapore , if you are not my country , whose country is it ?
the reasons made by Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am were not very no@@ bel : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in view of his , he appeared in@@ inev@@ it@@ ably un@@ democratic .
on the other hand , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that become permanent from a party .
these cities are demo@@ cr@@ atically .
once you reach the core point of the subject , the good old cor@@ er appears from the author@@ itarian rulers , which pret@@ end demo@@ cr@@ ates , leaving the twi@@ sted logic , as it fits better to their power .
in the end of this week , the last week of Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am gave answers to his American guests regarding our press , our dic@@ ate , our political system really non @-@ answers .
according to relevant questions , it tar@@ ts with non @-@ responses irr@@ ational styles .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls for Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am to illustr@@ ate his mind , since they did not understand this conclusion .
personally , I find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
if Singapore is not a country , but a city is , so far our city belongs ...
in short , I don &apos;t understand anything .
I would be very grateful if our dear K Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am would take the effort to clari@@ fy this point , if it was highly paid to be part of the government of Singapore .
by announ@@ cing on the blog , he has published his comment on the critics to start reading the complete co @-@ ordin@@ ance of the conference , so that you can understand the context of the statements of Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am better , according to which Singapore was a city and no country .
read the tran@@ script .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore was rather a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained why the elections in Singapore be so un@@ important , even if we are looking forward to free and just choices . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he compared to Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities witnessed a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said , Singapore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is no country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he obviously did not mean it in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cle@@ ment T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment via Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am , who as the leader of a growing generation , makes such a pol@@ em@@ ic statement .
I am about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said very much ...
at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Ye@@ w and the members of the old Gar@@ de that I expect - do I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing .
but with K. Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am , member of the new generation of the political leader of Singapore I have doubts and I &apos;m not even sure if he really believes that he really believes and aware of what he is defended .
the TE@@ MA@@ SEK Review dis@@ moun@@ ts the weak@@ nesses of Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ ams Arg@@ anda :
does Mr Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am &quot; committed a mistake &quot; or was it a free speaker ?
when Singapore is not a country , we are considered as an independent and so@@ vereign state ?
if not , on which country go back the so@@ vereign rights of the city of Singapore ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally country and city .
as he plays an important role within the government office , the statements of Mr. Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am are of severe importance .
why do the Singap@@ ur@@ ers afford their military service , but do they only defend their city ?
who must pay back our prime minister ?
what is the value of our pink personnel ?
are we citizens of a country , or the inhabitants of a city ?
in addition , the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade on affir@@ mation to Singapore is always a town :
&quot; I did not say what I said ... &quot;
this sentence seems to have been anno@@ yed by a lot of Singapore ...
no one has ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island nation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defense of the country above all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but that is not quite true . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we should rather speak of the defence of the city . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the myth of the &quot; cute Can@@ adi@@ ers &quot;
Canadian N@@ ed Flanders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices asked for short of his editors : what is the most ab@@ used aspect of your home country or home country ?
your answers will be published here as part of a continuous series , with rum@@ ors relating to certain parts of the world and to be shown another fac@@ et .
the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thompson , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
the question that is asked for me in Japan is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; no , I am sorry , &quot; I want to answer . &quot; I &apos;m from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I live and again in Japan .
depending on the situation the conversation takes place , it is considered to be polit@@ ely , interest in his conversation by asking personal questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on my clari@@ fication then the standard answer follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice hockey , nature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many Canadian cook perhaps inside anger , if they are kept for Americans , but don &apos;t b@@ other me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for someone who doesn &apos;t know , there is little that distingu@@ ishes us Can@@ adi@@ ans of Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Can@@ adi@@ ans bring a Canadian flag clearly visible on her backpack when travelling .
all dear Canadian .
Americans , however ... .
so it was already when I began to travel through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 .
Can@@ adi@@ ans have always carried small map@@ le leaves on their baggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbors .
we have a free health care !
there is no weapons with us !
same @-@ sex mar@@ riages are already legal in Canada since 2005 !
all seem to think Canada is so great .
we are polite .
we clearly say very often &quot; sorry . &quot;
Canada is also regarded as the most toler@@ ant country toward ethnic groups .
we are not like those types south of the border .
we Canadian are nice .
I hate that .
first , I have many American friends who I admire very much .
it wouldn &apos;t make me any thing if you would exchange myself from Johnny from Dallas .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there are some problems with the stamp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
first , to be called &quot; nice &quot; is basically a sp@@ ind@@ le to be sp@@ li@@ ous - as the gut@@ ters , soft , but trag@@ ically un@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flanders from &quot; Die Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has one own Canadian Doppel@@ gänger ) .
if Canada really had a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flanders , this would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality .
there are no corners and edges , nothing at which you can change .
being harmless means to be un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive and un@@ remarkable , and not to earn attention .
this can be something good if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , away from things that are happening around .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I even would go to say that the desire to be free and alone , a major member of the Canadian . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we tend to take care of our own affairs only .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what out@@ si@@ ders as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is perhaps just bold courtesy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Can@@ adi@@ ans don &apos;t talk about the fence over the fence .
we lack a warm heart@@ y , open friendliness , which I now connect with my American friends .
luckily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) , Justin Tru@@ de@@ au then entered the stage to show that Can@@ adi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our prime minister has made Canada down@@ right .
musical video of a pop @-@ band par@@ odi@@ zed Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one in Thailand &apos;s famous pop band has released a musical video that took power in 2014 , and despite their promises to recover the civil government , still re@@ ig@@ ning the country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells him which rules his girlfriend .
although not expressly politically , the music video refers in@@ directly to the pro@@ longed military dom@@ ination of the jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the country &apos;s situation .
the video to the song was a huge success .
in the first three days alone , the video @-@ loaded video 1.@@ 254 times was divided and received 8,@@ 800 likes .
last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; The dict@@ ator &quot; was blocked in Thailand , after a group of activists open the public , watch this video .
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai policy , in particular as it is with the situation of the country under the jun@@ ta rule .
have a look at these shots of the video that relate to some of the political issues that have har@@ med Thailand in the past three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may refer to the dra@@ stic Constitution &apos; 44 of the preliminary constitution which is the commander of the army &apos;s absolute decision making important national issues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 11th rule : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change your attitude &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Change &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people who are considered to be critics of the Jun@@ ta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crimin@@ ality , whose v@@ age and un@@ clear rules often are used by the authorities to susp@@ end activ@@ ist and other critics of the state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this purpose a new unit in the army has been established , the online content is monitored and persons who are accused of being de@@ fam@@ ed , prosec@@ uted the monarchy .
Thailand uses a strict face against &quot; L@@ esis Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ esty of Maj@@ esty ) .
on 20 May 2014 , the martial law was declared war in Thailand .
two days later , it came to a put@@ sch of the army .
one of the problems that the jun@@ ta still pursu@@ es is to buy expensive U @-@ boats , although security experts war@@ n them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of control .
in the video even shows how people are thrown into a black v@@ ans before they bring them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some journalists are in prison because they rep@@ or@@ tedly created &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confusion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in society and on Internet users , they should ins@@ ulted the monarchy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , the te@@ aser of the songs of the band formed the Sal@@ ut &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which was already used by Putin opponents during protests in 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
life goes on to the ruins of the ghost cities in the Eastern Ab@@ ch@@ as@@ ies

the following article , written by Dmit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ no@@ v , was first published on the website of OC Media and appears with kind permission .
the post @-@ war society re@@ covers only very slowly in East @-@ Ab@@ ch@@ asia , especially in the T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al district .
now over 20 years have passed since the Geor@@ gian @-@ ab@@ as@@ ian war officially ended , but its scars are still visible in this part of the republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern bor@@ ou@@ k in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show distinctive pictures .
villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ kh@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ ava are located in the carbon basin of Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , Eur@@ as@@ ies , Geor@@ gian and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together in the area .
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
today , the biggest part of Russians and par@@ ch@@ ases live in the area .
such sett@@ lements are also called viol@@ ale cities in Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
in the pre @-@ war period , more than 10,000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people in these spirits .
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of 16@@ ,000 people had risen to 16@@ ,000 people after they had barely increased over a decade .
in 1989 , about 4@@ 3.000 people lived in this district .

&quot; all this is a result of war &quot;
the empty five @-@ story blocks of the Soviet Union from the early &apos; 60s , called the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ t@@ schu@@ k@@ ow@@ kas , stand symbo@@ lically for the decline and the devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are decay and quite rare , they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a local old man .
he begins a conversation , and it is hard to stop this .
&quot; all this is a result of war . &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot;
it is still unique . &quot;
before the war , the village was full of life .
there were community centers , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens , who served all the community .
now there is only paved road with f@@ las@@ er@@ ous spl@@ end@@ or @-@ buildings .
people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning industry of the Soviet Union , meanwhile , have left the borough .
in the ghost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , about fifty residents live .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ che@@ v , which is still one or two families , you can recognize on the balconies where clothes is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when they discover me with the camera in the hand , they immediately move back .
&quot; our mother has forbidden us to photograph us , &quot; says one of the girls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is simply forbidden to us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her friend and suddenly she left the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence industry ( cultivation of agricultural products such as livestock farming , bee@@ keeping and vegetable farming .
it is difficult to get over the rounds .
the district management provides free candles and bread to the villages .

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build cour@@ get@@ tes . &quot;
about ten years ago an old woman moved to Gal@@ ina ( or aun@@ t G@@ alya , as it is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Jed@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
despite her oldest daughter , who lives in France , Gal@@ ina did not leave Ab@@ ch@@ asia to live with her . &quot; my heart will remain forever in Ab@@ ch@@ as@@ ies , &quot; she tells .
Gal@@ ina doesn &apos;t want to accept financial help from her daughter and insist@@ ed on supporting her young grand@@ son instead .
Gal@@ inas monthly pension are just nine dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it &apos;s very difficult to survive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
aun@@ t G@@ alya tells us that she and other vill@@ agers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year old woman and a young family and I live in this building .
when holidays are , we visit us .
but we can &apos;t do this constantly - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot;
while she tells her story , a younger neighbor appears on the balcony .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she calls her to her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said we could build cour@@ get@@ tes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I already prepared the ground .
I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build cour@@ get@@ tes . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ as talks partner Nat@@ ascha together with her husband and the five common children lived in her house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day she reminds of the village in front of the war .
despite the relatives who live in central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country Ab@@ ch@@ asia broke away ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave .

&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build a house there , but it will take some time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ ascha is spending about $ 9 child money for every child .
her husband works in the cab@@ bage ruin .
the young family has its own farm .
near the house where Nat@@ asha &apos;s kinder@@ garten was once again , they keep pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chickens .
it tells us that it was a very fri@@ ghtening situation , when many people left the village after the war .
but during the period , they lost their fears .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t be afraid of the dark street or few people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
but in fact , it has rather something to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war there was hardly any job and everyone lived like it was right .
I remember every day , like the city and the war once were . &quot;
when our conversation ten@@ ds to the end , a little boy is running on us .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hides .
a ball flies from the window and another boy turns him back .
he plays with the ball , who then down the hill .
a group of children pursu@@ ing the ball now .
while running , some of them throw stones to the buildings .

in Mexico , &quot; Mama Africa &quot; houses the migrants on their long journey
Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez heads a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border of Mexico to Guatemala .

this article by Amy Bra@@ cken published on April 19 , 2017 on the website of our partner PR@@ I.@@ org and published here with kind permission .
on the way of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , located on the border with Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
it is led by a 59@@ - year @-@ old Mexican writer , a small woman with a cor@@ all@@ ish pink flam@@ eco chassis and golden earrings in te@@ ddy bear .
she is called Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless they know many under the name Mama Africa .
this nickname is the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a target for Afri@@ cans and Ha@@ iti@@ ans who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
for about 2,50 dollars the night sleep the guests in simple rooms , with bare , br@@ ittle walls and beds made of metal .
there is a par@@ r@@ ots in a cage in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - still hundreds of African immigrants come here .
sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez told the people in full mini@@ buses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to call : &quot; Mama Africa !
where are you with Mama Africa ? &quot;
currently it &apos;s more quiet but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have slept outside on boxes outside .
she doesn &apos;t want to reject anybody .
she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick , she buys them medication that they cannot pay them , they mass@@ aged them with a bal@@ m that exhau@@ sts off the long voyage .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebast@@ i@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived at a short time ago .
I asked him whether Mama Africa was a reasonable nickname for Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the Sebast@@ i@@ ao family ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a yogh@@ urt cup ) pos@@ ing with Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to walk to Boston .
photo : Amy Bra@@ cken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he replies with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel that it suits her because African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebast@@ i@@ ao travels with his sister she hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and her three children .
they already lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on the way to the United States to take a first stop in South America and then move north .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the family had heard from other pione@@ ers in M@@ om Africa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he tells us that Ha@@ iti@@ ans and Afri@@ cans often travel along the route and that Afri@@ cans have already speaking to W@@ hat@@ s@@ App by Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
as many of his companion , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil in advance and worked as a construction worker for the Olympic Games and the FIFA World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy has been weaker , he started his journey into the United States .
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months . he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the Bu@@ st@@ ic@@ ket to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he will contact Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let them go again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is smiling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will always remain in touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez told that their guests have often send text messages when they are gone to gr@@ ate them or to report about the course of their journey .
she explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work .
she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa but her guests have taught them to prepare chicken as in Ghana .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known here , but it is not the only spark of hope for migrants who are travelling through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have recorded migrants in their little house .
it is a polic@@ eman and has found that the Bu@@ st@@ ick@@ ets are sold to numerous African immigrants .
he started to help them to get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for a dollar spent the night .
at the moment , there are 25 people , mainly Ha@@ iti@@ ans .
some sleep on the ground , but at least they have electricity , washing machine and a kitchen outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests can do .
&quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; he told . &quot; I experienced what they are experiencing .
I crossed the border crossing the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others do not help . that &apos;s why I give them my support . &quot;
after he lived for three years , he was deported to a raid on his office from the United States .
the majority of migrants who travels through Tap@@ ach@@ ula comes from Central America , other inhabitants also open the doors of their houses for them .
José Antonio Cor@@ do@@ va Mel@@ én@@ dez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to make money from him , without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for a housing and an un@@ familiar , single @-@ minded , offered to him their roof .
a few months later the family lives still there and she tries to decide where the next steps should go .
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is again full of guests .
in the courses , the trav@@ ellers consult their phones .
a mini@@ bus arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , most of Somalia .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is nost@@ al@@ gic , because of those who have gone away .
like a proud grandmother , she leaf@@ lets her album in her album with numerous photos .
there are one of her daughter with African hair spots that you made a client , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , kids and old .
she laughs , while she imag@@ ines her .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ er@@ on &quot; is repeated every time . &quot; they have already gone . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; in the message , the app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should get access to terrorist information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the authorities used to use the app for more than fight against terrorism .
according to an exclusive report of Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ fecture , because they had installed the app shortly after they had been replaced with a private chat group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the communication of the police , the app would determine the sources and the distribution channels of terrorists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contradic@@ tions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal religious &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; activities and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; harmful information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; including videos , images , e@@ Books and documents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ gs website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elecom .
the main function is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic web pages , of online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing pages to make users attentive to how much time they spend online , and to remot@@ ely control their own home network .
this app , with the filters for min@@ ors , aims to help the children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many ways .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; or even h@@ ack@@ ers capable of manipul@@ ating a person &apos;s home network or steal it .
this introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
while news about digital c@@ ens@@ orship in China mostly focus on the experience of users in the larger cities in the east and south , the reality is often very dark for those who live in distant ethnic minority regions like X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
to limit distur@@ ban@@ ces and dis@@ satisfaction in conflict areas , authorities often arrange extreme c@@ ens@@ ors and security measures as well as rout@@ in@@ ely Internet inter@@ ventions .
the media @-@ based media Out@@ let &quot; Images from the China &quot; ( standardized in China ) , the cen@@ sored news published in China , showed photos from a Check@@ point where the residents were sel@@ ectable if they had installed the surveillance app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure the people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification requested that people install the app within 10 days .
if you are discovered at a Check@@ point with a device without these software , they may be imprisoned for up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced people to use devices that are intended for older people .
this is a form of captivity through the rest of w@@ aking technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; images from the China &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( the base of the base of the Base ) also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , out of which the software can lift the password requirements of a Windows operating system and thus receive unlimited access to the computer &apos;s hard drive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and mobile phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang are to electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
the provisions in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may have a reaction to the instructions of the City Party Council to minim@@ ize the spread of illegal content .
all government branches , authorities and related institutions , including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the instructions of Cyber@@ security Office when operating their computers and communication devices .
a recent report by Freedom House , a US @-@ American human rights organisation , also mentioned this new monitoring methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , authorities published on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi a decree with the statement to all residents and entrepren@@ eurs , until August 1 , their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks , and media memory cards . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the intention is obviously able to identify and destroy any &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrorist videos &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; this action viol@@ ates the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a number of other possible violation , including those who relate to peaceful religious or political messages . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sleep or death , Part 1 : all cri@@ es after death

&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the first of six reports in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sleep or death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane portra@@ ys his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot; &quot; &quot;
far from our blue , virtual world you look at and make sure you &apos;re alone at a place where everything is all important .
everything has changed after and after dis@@ sol@@ ves and a truth revealed , which is clearly identi@@ fi@@ able , both from inside and outside .
one that makes their name all honor .
one that has struck down in a list of feelings and supp@@ ress no met@@ aph@@ ors .
but if you look back the reality and look behind the scenes - beyond the acting , the beautiful scenes and the performer - turn the characters into beings of flesh and blood , and everything cri@@ es after death .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all doubts dissolve in smoke , and you will be aware of your existence , even if the earth turns on to the axis of the Un@@ le@@ ils . it is clear that you are caught up here between the walls that have built up your parents &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stone &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they have arrested me and my father three times , but this was not enough for me to learn &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my lesson , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; like the chief of the Security Service , with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he presented his power over us , as he even destroyed the sim@@ pl@@ est concepts we knew .
five young people were torn off during a peaceful protests such as we@@ eds from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
it was enough for the city to cr@@ ush the darkness of the night with &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; scre@@ ams .
all the city districts sought , only my own not .
for the first time it was silent , in@@ efficient , for false time , even if I had no high demands on a city , which is up to the arter@@ ies with state safety organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces .
in the third night things had a bit cal@@ med down after the power supply had stopped in the quarter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I broke the silence by crying several times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from my house roof . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I heard my voice resist@@ ed through the silence .
a few minutes later , some of my friends felt cour@@ ageous enough to gather together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends joined me ; we alli@@ ed us to a beautiful picture that filled my expectations and completely filled .
in such a moment , you are aware that you delivered the spirit out of the lamp , but it simply doesn &apos;t care in the least .
I received a call from my father : &quot; make you ready , we meet in the military security building . &quot;
he put on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I learned the following : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low - nothing can give you your voice , after you brought it all the way to the office of security from the body . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I arrived there .
the Colonel Gh@@ assan stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I am now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Colonel Gh@@ assan begins to speak : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me hear how you cry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ gä@@ u Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or you are only brave enough to scre@@ am if we are not near . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his filled eyes appeared on me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you trust yourself to look in my eyes , and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did so did nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood in front of this building .
perhaps it was about my fol@@ ly , vanity ; perhaps in the revolution .
I was so sure when I answered , &quot; I would not think you have forgotten my voice since yesterday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I think I never stopped to look at you in my eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I don &apos;t regret a word of what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does it in individual and his father equal with them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; his father is with them . &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this cursed sentence lies in me until now in the nose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he became a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; syndrome , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a mental torture that I was exposed to months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I cry the farm .
at the first office I leave everything I carry with myself .
then by the farm and into the second office , which leads through a gang to the individual cells .
I describe all details exactly before I manage the room .
otherwise they have assigned a greater cell to me this time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to share it with only one other prisoner and may immediately place me without waiting for her permission . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes , who felt like a whole life , the officials left the cell , and I took back on an old @-@ proven communication method : to strike with f@@ ist against the wall .
I learned that my cell phone was a &quot; merciful det@@ ain@@ ling . &quot;
after a long h@@ ow@@ ry , he finally answered me .
apparently , in any of the surrounding cells was a respected man @-@ middle age , which looks similar to me and is called &quot; the doctor . &quot;
in perfect darkness , no prominent facial features can be recognized , and physi@@ cians don &apos;t exist ; we are all only numbers .
&quot; maybe someone whose voice sounds like mine ? &quot;
all answers relate his existence .
perhaps he was moved to one of the big cells .
perhaps he will stop immediately .
the investig@@ ator had assured me , they would release him when I stay .
li@@ ar .
gladly I would have had a scar@@ ec@@ row to drive all these cro@@ ws , which lab@@ elled in the fruits in the garden of my head .
I still listen to &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; from the distance .
it must be about 10 am in the evening ; always around this time the cri@@ es , every day .
the door opens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was always convinced that black the colour of corruption is , until I saw the yellow light , which gave us the hor@@ ror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Don@@ ner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the 13th S@@ ure of the Kor@@ an ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they are here to be heard . &quot;
thus it was secret to protect and prevent the state security before us and to prevent the terrorists in us , they talk in the al@@ a@@ wit@@ ian dial@@ ect - so they played their con@@ vol@@ ition card and dist@@ orted the narrow point of view of their world view .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not a house , which is not a country ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to transform the crimin@@ als into a hero . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I cared for the hearing and meet Abu I@@ mad , a slim and sto@@ cky man ; at least he comes to me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he starts a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; despite the facial expres@@ sions , that would come to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My boy , you are still young , you can start so much more important with your life than to protest these day@@ time and to protest them soon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not answer .
I have acc@@ ust@@ omed to myself , not to answer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can really no longer say when ins@@ ults and stro@@ kes become a friendly conversation for me to become an ordinary communication agent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when and how this happened was un@@ important .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a voice in me told me to be punished if I had to be punished if I had nothing to earn this punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at punishment in all its diversity .
his command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body .
he calls the lov@@ ingly &quot; conf@@ ession . &quot;
it begins with a plastic pipe , which probably comes from the clo@@ ak .
your Hen@@ ker ra@@ vis@@ h@@ eth at your cry .
give him the pleasure , you cannot measure you with him , and you cannot hold your cry .
my cry was not enough for him , which is why they made the re@@ ed out of a cable .
in my first arrest , I asked whether the investig@@ ator had worked as a garbage collection or whether it belonged to normal working equipment .
they had four cables in each other to present themselves from their perspective , great invention of a giant cable .
within a single hour three of them changed , while I was still in the row .
I had lost every feeling in my body - and my voice is why I listened to scre@@ am .
the Hen@@ ker re@@ marked the cooling down and found no plum@@ age so that it is the next to an electri@@ cally charged staff .
stream through all your body , enough to store my whole quarter .
my semi @-@ nude body , which was stretched out on the ground , was the perfect black@@ head .
the num@@ b@@ ness van@@ ished and the pain was back again .
after two terrible hours , he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
it must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep back again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
some hours passed , which came to me like minutes .
then the appeal to the morning prayer .
the door opens and the morning light ful@@ fills the space . &quot; R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fic@@ ker . &quot;
I am answering the voice of an exhau@@ sting young people : &quot; my lord , my father has to worry about . &quot;
&quot; be silent and walk away , you are going to be laid . &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they had always been released .
where do they take me ? !
the Jord@@ anian Rap@@ per Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b talks about the rights of LGB@@ T@@ Q + community , free expression of expression and resistance
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b re@@ covers the majority of his time inside ; sometimes he s@@ itt@@ eth to his screen , to his computer , and again to his couch .
what you can rely on is a cigarette between his fingers or his nic@@ otine bor@@ dered lips to discover .
he died in the top of his family house which had belonged to them since 1967 ; the year , in which Israel had completed its occupation of the West Bank , and H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs family had forced to flee from their village in Palestine , where they had lived as fel@@ ah@@ ye@@ es ( about : Farmer ) .
for six years , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist that was transferred to the conservative majority and left their old proven opinions on sex roles , sexu@@ ality and free expression of expression through art and rap@@ ture .
with his music they often deal with topics such as Ori@@ ent@@ alism , rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian ge@@ wing@@ ed , but also calls for the core of the entire Arab world , but also in cities that from Damascus to reach San@@ aa within Yemen .
with its 25 years , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees himself as a man who is not restricted by limits to his mind , and he can feel according to their own statement by people who suffer from the devast@@ ating consequences of foreign intervention in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even though he does not give it open , he puts a special ten@@ se against US foreign policy .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b looked at his art in his studio in Amman .
recorded by the author .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b does not believe that his sympathy for those who try to do in war zones , must do anything with his identity as &quot; Palestinian ge@@ aring of the second generation &quot; - so he himself was born in Jordan and never before Palestine .
&quot; I don &apos;t think of my own living conditions so , &quot; emphas@@ izes H@@ d@@ ai@@ b .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think I &apos;m a person , while he pour into two cups . it is the holy month Ram@@ adan , in this time it is intended for Muslims to fast sunset from sunrise to sunset . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also says that the public consumption of food is illegal during Ram@@ adan .
obviously H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee at a sen@@ ing hot young Congress has little to do with protest against Islam .
basically the s@@ mu@@ g swe@@ pt the coffee and the sw@@ aths of the K@@ ent cig@@ ar in the nose into the first line of freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open air , especially when you throw a look into the neighbouring countries .
it is simply avoid@@ able to do basic things - as in the public during Ram@@ adan water - to land not to land in prison .
recently , the Interior Ministry of Jordan took part in the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Le@@ ila , already for the second time .
some par@@ liament@@ arians support the Muslim Brotherhood - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argue that the sexual orientation of the homosex@@ ual inc@@ ts , Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no , contra@@ dict the cultural and traditional nor@@ ms of the country , and the main reason for the concert hall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an interview with CNN , the Socialist Coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said that the concert &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had been cancelled because of the sexual orientation of the sc@@ ans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many also claim the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , Human Rights and free speech of expression in the Arab world is more dangerous ac@@ ti@@ vis@@ m that in@@ quire the old legitim@@ acy of author@@ itarian regim@@ es in the entire region . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Le@@ ila appreciated the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; progressive supporters of human rights &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who continues to stand for an intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this statement is probably not just the rhetor@@ ic of rhetor@@ ic , but actually a more evident reality reflected in Jordan , which emerges in H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs &apos;s work .
in 2016 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b created traditional gender nor@@ ms to body , formed by his vision of the fate of Arabic women who did not have sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of a clearly drunk uni@@ denti@@ fied woman whose arms and legs stretch out to the corners of the canvas .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those who should actually trust .
over the past years , Jordan has increased the number of &apos; hon@@ our@@ able moral &apos; - the un@@ official outside .
according to Human Rights Watch , the number of Hon@@ our in 2016 reached its cul@@ mination in 2016 ; however , the institutional infrastructure is missing to support women who attempted to support the victims of murder or domestic violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to a law on the frag@@ ile loss of the year 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and for her release , often a years of bureau@@ cratic effort and the guarantee on the family is necessary that the woman will not happen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs music is a great popularity and is known for it , also not shy away from themes that have long been t@@ aboo in his country .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b deny that his work is politically , however , that he is his music that is full of explic@@ it announ@@ cements on sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression of expression .
&quot; I come from the food , man .
he was inst@@ aller on me , &quot; he says .
in a song called &apos; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b takes the question of the Palestinian identity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lies the focus again on poverty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the list of songs that are politically active in the core , can be continued .
in March 2016 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b released a song titled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse repeated itself often :
&quot; you are free , and every other is it . &quot;
in further course of the song , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b describes the world as a kind of market , on which one can get in his words , &quot; that can get what you want &quot; - be Faith or Non@@ sense , H@@ et@@ ero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality .
he not@@ ices that there are hardly anyone in Jordan on the rights of gay and readers , and that comments on equality of LGB@@ T@@ Q + individuals are still heavily cen@@ sored by 2014 .
in 2014 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b conducted an interview for the popular j@@ ord@@ an On@@ line@@ Program Ro@@ ya to remember that his comments were torn out of the context , twi@@ sted and cen@@ sored in his view .
&quot; on Youtube , it was uploaded without cuts , but it was only a revised version , &quot; he says .
today , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b advert@@ ises the Arab LGB@@ T@@ Q + community and represent the opinion that int@@ ol@@ er@@ ance against homosexu@@ als do not speak of Islam .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ what , a poet of the eighth century , who still has remained in memory thanks to his hom@@ o@@ erotic poetry .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b asks itself : if Abu Nu@@ what was supposed to work once again on behalf of the Cali@@ ph , in eighth century openly about homosexu@@ ality , why can Jord@@ an@@ ier not know that ?
the real problem , so H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , I have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; Le@@ ila or the fact that the concert was canc@@ eled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ian kingdom there is nothing new that the government announced the attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are being put to silence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian news service announced several former government officials and members of the textbook that were critic@@ ized with the problems in social media , which were united with the deeply rooted corruption in the country .
in view of this , the H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs concert is only the tip of the ice@@ berg - the actual challenge is to make structural changes in the next generation of the Jord@@ an@@ ians .
for him , progress is a constant giving and taking . Jordan has denied a appearance for the second time in a row , but the way of progress - so it looks like a slow , bed@@ side and internal changes . it is certain that these changes will take place daily in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society .
ultimately , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , also dre@@ amt of an Arab world without inter@@ ventions from abroad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is not only dre@@ aming of bringing his work to Bagh@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also of it &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the region is thinking about music , art and literature of a true and basic op@@ enness - and not by bombs , stre@@ et@@ un@@ itions , and on artificial kind . at least he hopes it .
until it is ready , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b will continue to ra@@ p and thus afford resistance .
this report was made by the Pul@@ itzer Center on Crisis Rep@@ orting , which A@@ man belong as a student Fel@@ low .
Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 largest festivals in Japan .
these big , extravag@@ ant war pu@@ ppen are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ uta festival .
it is thought that there is a variation of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival that is usually also celebrated in many areas of To@@ ho@@ kus . another theory suggests that the wag@@ ons , the drums and dancing were taken over a thousand years , in order to force the indigenous people of the region to force the indigenous people of the region , the Em@@ ishi , to force the knee .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we could catch a few great seats , so we have a great view .
you can only imagine how big these parts are ...
a joint centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition at W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( liter@@ al ) .
I &apos;ve been watching the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en again for a long time : there are two wag@@ ons just to see .
nevertheless , for many people who take the journey to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta festival will take the only way to spend his summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer Festival in the North of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a 18 metres high tower was amazing .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !

rarely were outer appearance and body care so important as in this story , because they help to promote the Peruvian youth from Crime and promote a legitim@@ ate profession like the hair@@ der .
El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of the capital Lima , a region with a very high crime rate , where street rob@@ ber@@ y and illegal drug traff@@ icking are daily .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region do not feel safe .
in the same time Peru - like many other middle and South American countries - rising demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend , appearance and also the unusual hair@@ styles by famous athletes such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( Peru ) , has led to become more norm@@ ality in the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ s@@ ers , which can recre@@ ate these aw@@ ful hair@@ styles .
the un@@ preced@@ ented demand for hair@@ styles , which go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition of hair@@ dresser &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 .
there are experts in each other to show who can create the most un@@ centr@@ alized L@@ ooks you can see in the following video ( other videos on current competitions there are on public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as the school August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , who found themselves in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to persu@@ ade young people to find their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and to obtain training in hair art , which allows them to find work .
motivated by this activity and the opportunity , dozens of teen@@ agers have seen that they can take a job , which is currently in fashion .
the school year before the school year announced special training workshops and reported some of their successes :
in 1995 we were the only specialist school in the community and the district , which we are very proud , because of love for the children we built this educational community .

the entry will be published here in a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people who we know ?
is it not yet much more important , people who are e@@ jected to offer affection ?
this question was exactly this question the two young colony activists Leonardo P@@ á@@ r@@ ra@@ ga from the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art and Crist@@ ian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young Youth Foundation and inspired her to write letters to the campaign cart@@ as p@@ or la Rec@@ on@@ cili@@ ación ( letters for Rec@@ on@@ ciliation ) , the young people encouraged to write gu@@ err@@ illa fighters letters .
only recently , its land was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute to their part : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had signed a peace agreement with the Guer@@ ill@@ a@@ movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary armed forces ) , which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; International applied to the peace agreement as so significant that the Colom@@ bian president Jose Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his services . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , in front of the columns there is still a long way to speak from a real prop@@ iti@@ ation and peace . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ err@@ ill@@ ak@@ klu@@ ft , who lived for many years in illegal camps , were exposed to a war rhetor@@ ic , and around the clock had carried their weapons at themselves and now have to integrate into life as civilians .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Colom@@ bian society , again , who had become acc@@ ust@@ omed to life in some cases and in some cases , must now record their ranks and support them in the construction of a new life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Leonardo and Crist@@ ian were convinced that the young colum@@ bi@@ ans would close together and help with the integration process .
and that &apos;s exactly what they did : until now , thousands of young people have written letters - love bot@@ an@@ ings to former gu@@ err@@ illa fighters in order to welcome them back in society .
the goal of the campaign are 6@@ 900 letters - one for each former gu@@ err@@ illa , which should then be handed over personally .
the Valentine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the letter to reconciliation was held at the World Summit of the Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ate who took place in Bog@@ ot@@ á . there , Leonardo and Crist@@ ian had the opportunity to speak shortly with Kail@@ ash Sat@@ y@@ arth@@ i , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this stated that we love the people who love to write thousands of love letters , but those who need them need much unnecessary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he plane , he told him to share his love with people this year , who needed most urgent issues .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so the plan arose , letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the letters will show that Colom@@ bian society is ready to make a dis@@ course from a war history to a common history of peace , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they say . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than 2000 letters were collected during the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á .
&apos;@@ i never thought that someone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over on March 19 in one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region .
a group of 40 students from the University of J@@ aver@@ iana in Cal@@ i , two members of the Municip@@ ality of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art traveled into the camp to bring the letters personal .
the members of the F@@ ARC presented themselves as they had done earlier in order to oppos@@ e the commands of their leaders .
but this time they didn &apos;t receive commands , but letters full of sub@@ protected people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for all involved . &quot; it &apos;s unbelievable how many different feelings can walk through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that lies in between , &quot; explains the polit@@ ician Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z Av@@ ila later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , an employee of the Governor of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience :
after crossing the letters , a former fighter led me through the camp of gu@@ err@@ illa fighters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when I saw in one of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cam@@ book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( a kind of hut , where the gu@@ err@@ illa life ) saw , I saw a gu@@ err@@ illa , who wrote something . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was afraid to go down , as beside him on the bed was a M@@ GL gren@@ ade , a deadly weapon in the bush .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but I spoke to him and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hello , what are they doing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am answering a letter which someone wrote to me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; never in my life someone has written something like this , that &apos;s why I answer it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the tears ran through the che@@ eks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I embra@@ ced him completely , and put me beside the p@@ omeg@@ ran@@ ates .
maybe he was sorry for the war , I was sorry to be all those years of the faithful companions of this battle , and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he had never expected something else from life . the F@@ ARC had never been expecting him to preserve him and his six brothers before the Hung@@ er@@ to@@ d . &quot; I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistake .
but now I know that there is a company outside , waiting for us with open arms .
until now , I only learned how to deal with weapons .
but now where peace is prev@@ ailing , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
for the pre@@ lu@@ de , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC came together to a discussion round .
the students were all grown up as a war and the F@@ ARC was already in secret .
therefore , the leaders of the F@@ ARC declared the history of the organisation , its ide@@ als and gave insight into their views on the whole Colom@@ bian people . now , where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party , we can help to develop the society in this country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the aim of this mag@@ n@@ itude is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
those people who had never heard that previously had never heard and had no electoral law , and even learned to know that people who were often shot as monsters and even hate , even people with beautiful feelings and their environment was very painful for me .
the reality where the country lives , doesn &apos;t hurt me .
but it comforts me that all men - even those who have killed and so much harm can be taught us and give us a smile and a hug .
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
Gust@@ avo Gonz@@ á@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ ío de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , arch@@ bishop of the city of Cal@@ i , the following letter :
colum@@ bi@@ an@@ ists was proph@@ es@@ ied that peace would prevail after dis@@ arm@@ ament peace .
but this is not the case .
as long as it is ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are ready to rise to the weapons and to protest their rights and that is completely justified ( ... ) .
we from the F@@ ARC now rely on peace , on a policy without weapons .
that is why we call all def@@ enders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ide@@ ology they belong - to rise above all those that dream of a country in the war .
we give you our word , make our contribution , and give sacrifices , for we know of their own experience that nothing is simple . the one among us who defend life as the basis of existence will be min@@ ent .
on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them .

homosex@@ ual and que@@ er people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ ian region are exposed to a great range of dangers - including discrimination , physical violence and sexual violence and ex@@ tor@@ tion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with hor@@ ror , activists have witnessed the coverage of the last months over the persecution of gay men in Che@@ chn@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the threat , which depends on the LGB@@ T@@ Q community , is not just about night .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny , who share some of their experiences with us and talked about what is currently happening in the republic .
the LGB@@ T@@ Q legal situation in Che@@ chn@@ ya has conquered the international head@@ lines several months ago , after reports were published , which at@@ ised the towing , torture and killing of que@@ er men in the republic .
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the Now@@ aya Gaz@@ eta . she threw a light on the methods of Che@@ chn@@ ya authorities , susp@@ ecting suspic@@ ious que@@ er men and put them into secret pris@@ ons in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; they have brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sabrina , a trans@@ wife , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there .
she felt that she felt a woman in reality .
when she was grown up , you became aware that Che@@ chn@@ ya was no safe place for them , which was why they moved to Moscow .
after a group of Che@@ chens were experienced by the gender equality of her land@@ lady , the hunt was opened to Sabrina .
for fear of her life , she moved to the USA last du@@ des .
Sabrina : I worked as a volunteer hel@@ per in a human rights organisation .
one day , I told me that someone needed my help .
it was a friend from Da@@ gest@@ an , a trans@@ itory , which was in trouble .
she had no money , so I took them without hes@@ itation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while I tried to help you , someone from whom I thought he would be a copy of mine documents , and spread them anywhere on his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so there &apos;s no men in Che@@ chn@@ ya who can eliminate these shame ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after that , the photos of my documents took the round of the W@@ hat@@ s@@ App .
I was attacked on 10 October 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when I was doing just a few grocery bags of my car , I heard a male voice saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Here is a gift for you from your uncle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I did nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard a phrase , but this time on Che@@ chn@@ ya : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long do you want the family to join her ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
I only know that there was a young man , not 30 years old .
then I lost consciousness and woke up the last du@@ des in the hospital .
apparently some women had received everything and started out to scre@@ am .
the man was fled .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital , I learned that I had two sampling in my right lung wings .
OC Media : which wings have you laid out - in which the men or the women ?
Sabrina : my documents are out@@ dated , there is still my male name ; but the doctor stood and put me to the women .
I am very grateful to him .
when I read his name for the first time at his office door , I was afraid to do it with fear ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ cas@@ ian name .
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him that he is respec@@ tful with me .
I spent more than one month in the hospital .
last February , I got threats .
they called me , wrote me - relatives , stranger , some completely unknown .
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbours and some remote relatives .
the requested , send me back to Che@@ chn@@ ya to prove that all that was a lie .
they asked absurd claims : some say to me , I must prove it off by streets ; others wanted that I had not changed in the official television in Gros@@ ny , and I say that I had not changed my sex , that everything was just bad talk , and Photoshop .
I have grain size C - what should I have to say on television ?
OC Media : how has your family tried to deal with this pressure ?
Sabrina : it &apos;s still difficult for them .
some older people once said my mother on the road .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You have brought a monster to the world , not only your family , but the entire republic was ashamed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we can &apos;t touch you , because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must van@@ ish from here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my mother got too much and she got a rope around the neck .
luckily the neighbors and saved them came .
at the time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later there was a car with dar@@ ken@@ ed window plates and a number plate with a 95 .
after the third time happened , I realized that there was a bit lazy .
my human rights friends checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how are you fled ?
Sabrina : with the help of activists .
for safety reasons , I don &apos;t want to give their names but I want to remember them all ; they really helped me .
with their help I left the country , but then something terrible happened .
I can still not understand how it could be .
shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother once I arrived .
I bought them , without registration , without ID , without everything .
I broke my old SIM card and threw it in the garbage .
arrived and checked in the hotel .
the number was registered with a stranger .
I hid the SIM card in my mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the moment when I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t believe , you would be safe , just because you left the country ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
our people know already , in which hotel you spell . you even know your room number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only to prove it : it &apos;s the 115 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
can you imagine this ? !
that was actually my room number .
OC Media : do you still stand in touch with your family ?
Sabrina : only with my mother and my sisters .
however , we don &apos;t talk about the gender equality , but this is a t@@ aboo subject .
I still carry some traditional Cau@@ cas@@ ian items in me .
so much I wish I can &apos;t overcome this se@@ el@@ ian barrier .
I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to hurt them .
when we chat with camera , I really give trouble to look like the person to look at them from their past - so to my male form .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know anything about the current situation in Che@@ chn@@ ya ?
what are your friends , those who are d@@ ort@@ able ?
Sabrina : I submitted a report in Washington last week .
I needed more information about the situation in Che@@ chn@@ ya .
I spoke to somebody who had one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he told that during Ram@@ adan , he was arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan were barely able to wait , and he did not lock a new wave .
most likely they will focus on family and relatives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so that my I , they probably invite their relatives , these take care of the problem with the affected person , and at the end demand a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honor &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experience by blood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : are now even gay men arrested in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sabrina : a friend of me says it would not be very many .
if , then especially those who have no rich relatives or were left behind their relatives to place Kad@@ y@@ rows &apos;s court .
as far as I know , they are detained there so that they can present yourself later as terrorists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Should they be killed , they will show their bodies on television and claim they have attacked any village or a military base . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you understand ?
as if these people were not simply van@@ ished , but di@@ pped specifically to radic@@ alise herself .
OC Media : is that now just a mistake or do you have a source for this information ?
Sabrina : I just quote someone who was imprisoned in Ar@@ gun for a half months .
he says that many people had disappeared in this prison after their be@@ ard had grown .
there have been nothing new of them since .
they just took them .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was , as these people were taken away .
however , until now , they were not introduced as band@@ its , so far there were no reports about it . however , we susp@@ ect such actions are possible .
why would it not be allowed to shave these people ?
do you know if these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation have already occurred in the past ?
Sabrina : I &apos;ve been wearing my hair always long .
in Che@@ chn@@ ya , I had a Bob .
I think that before 2003 , I was already well known in Great Britain , when I was still living there - and I never had problems .
Ernst ! in Ernst !
even from 1998 to 1999 when the Sh@@ aria was considered , I never had problems .
on the contrary , it was much safer than now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia originally wanted to lead us to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; civil war &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but finally threw us back to the st@@ one@@ age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under Sh@@ aria law ?
Sabrina : my eyebrows were gri@@ pped ; I had colored eyelashes , bore tube je@@ ans and short tops .
the Ministry of Security of Sh@@ aria has never touched me a hair too .
before the Russian theater in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every night , especially at weekends , a whole group of people met me .
it was a small place where several ben@@ ches stood , and the whole city knew it ; they knew why men , young people , met there .
we have never been ins@@ ulted .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a Rede@@ mp@@ le : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that means : &quot; Scot@@ sman is not about mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
you often say it to children when they make sick of sick .
OC Media : so they just have their eyes closed before you because they believed they are sick ?
Sabrina : yes .
they never ins@@ ulted me , never hun@@ ted and never defeated .
OC Media : how long did this wil@@ low cost ?
Sabrina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ row came to the plan .
when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began to talk about mor@@ als on television .
he did not talk about us , but primarily about the behaviour of women .
nevertheless - you could feel how people started to change in the city .
those who had suffered and laughed at once , did not see you with suspicion .
at the time I left Che@@ chn@@ ya .
but every time I got back home , I could feel how the situation in the republic gets worse .
OC Media : what activity do you go now ?
Sabrina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I do not earn much - $ 700 to 800 dollars per month in the US .
apart from that , I &apos;m still working as an activ@@ ist .
currently , I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organize te@@ et@@ re@@ ffs , mer@@ gers , I join them to the hospital and help them to get food types .
I don &apos;t have a p@@ enny for it .
I have discovered these people , when I conc@@ eive of breeding .
I am Muslims and want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear an Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sabrina : that &apos;s al@@ able .
so is nature , that has nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same as Che@@ chens who proph@@ es@@ ying with foam in front of the mouth , that there are no spo@@ ols in them .
the Da@@ gest@@ ans have which the Cab@@ ard@@ iner have , the Russians have known what they have ; on the whole planet they exist - but &quot; not in Che@@ chn@@ ya . &quot;
I &apos;m from there , that &apos;s why it is unpleasant for me to hear .
here I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and during Ram@@ adan - live together with men .
you know , many think of tran@@ si@@ dent@@ ity to men who love men and believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a turbul@@ ent .
these are two different things - two different ways of feeling to be precise , different life settings .
for me it is the most important thing to feel me in my own skin and not to be ashamed for my body .
not if I have a partner or not .
sorry I &apos;m so personal , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago .
and I am not sad at all - I simply don &apos;t know that I &apos;m myself .
local groups war@@ n against an increase of self @-@ moral within the armed Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi community in Iran
Iranian ancest@@ or region suff@@ ers from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
for the past few months there is a strong increase of self @-@ mor@@ ality .
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was made available by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : using with permission .
the self @-@ burning of a man called Jas@@ sim Mor@@ amaz@@ i de@@ pressed the desper@@ ate situation of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi community in Iran on August 27 , influenced by poverty and unemployment , to the spotlight .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ ra@@ z in the southwest of Iran .
he suffered under anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed for his own hel@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness to get in@@ ability for his family , such as Ah@@ w@@ azi human rights groups , who want to work and remain anonymous .
a video shared on YouTube kept the moments after he had kind@@ led himself , firmly .
some people put it quickly to er@@ ase the flames and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ eg@@ hani @-@ hospital in the city of Ah@@ ra@@ z .
according to local sources , burns were so strong that doctors could do nothing more .
he died a short time later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not the only suicide that has established itself in August within the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi minority , and activists warned on site that even more men could take life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ah@@ w@@ azi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some other - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ b@@ awi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - hung up .
their stories have a thing in common : there were all family pat@@ ern@@ ers , who felt hel@@ pless and unable to eat their families , and to follow a safe work .
Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region , where most of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi community living in Iran , was shaken by a profound economic crisis which makes it difficult to deny the native Arab population .
a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran , until the P@@ ahl@@ avi monarchy assumed power and had taken great effort in 1925 to stop ethnic autonomy all over Iran .
in the region of Ah@@ ra@@ z , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran , as well as some of the most experienced and valuable commercial areas for Iranian agriculture .
despite this valuable resources , the regional economy is still developing slowly , and the indigenous population receives only little of this wealth .
it is often victims of untreated disease , hunger and de@@ comp@@ ense .
the Iranian regime ref@@ uses to overthrow the Ah@@ mad@@ azi Ara@@ bians in local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industry .
the government has also built a multitude of d@@ us@@ men , the waters of the Arab territ@@ ories in the Persian areas , where the Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an Province , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ hom lie .
these dam@@ s have only managed to swal@@ low the devast@@ ation in the region by d@@ rought , and to destroy local agriculture as well as fish and palm trees industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ Hawai@@ ian youth has now risen to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian general director for co@@ operative , work and social welfare , reported that 5 % of Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is who has completed a job that ended primary school , 55 % completed a secondary school and 45 % having a university degree .
a &quot; systematic strategy ... that aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance &quot;
Kar@@ im Doh@@ im@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ mad@@ azi human rights activ@@ ist with residence in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; resulted in a &quot; high increase &quot; of the number of self @-@ moral amongst the young Ah@@ w@@ azi men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ken@@ ji Doh@@ im@@ i said that especially the unemployment has become worse . reason is a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ sians and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the integration process : &quot; &quot; &quot;
as officials and institutions do not prefer Arab labour force , the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi is dispos@@ ed of access to employers in all sectors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime that aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and to force them to earn their li@@ vel@@ ih@@ ood out of their home ancest@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are people who had to hide their ancest@@ or and sur@@ name to hide their belonging to the Ah@@ w@@ azi , as even Arab names are not toler@@ ated by the workplace , because the speech of Arabic language or the wearing of Arabic clothes are not toler@@ ated .
given the circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi must end@@ ure , human rights activ@@ ist alarm , before the situation explo@@ sives .
it remains to be seen whether the world is w@@ aking up and aware of it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoid@@ able .

&quot; why I identify myself with femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ als not &quot;
detail of a photos . recorded by Pix@@ ab@@ ay . published under the CC@@ 0 Creative Commons License .
the following article is a revised version of the opinion that was published by Ay@@ om@@ ide and originally published on the website of Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as . the article was the subject of several discussions where many different positions came to expression .
they can be read in the comments under the original text .
if I say that I &apos;m not a femin@@ ist , many women - especially white women who themselves describe themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - with fru@@ stration .
they wonder why I &apos;m not part of the movement .
they even thought well thought out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be femin@@ ist and why we generally should be all femin@@ ists * .
for example , women nowadays still earn less money in spite of the same education than men .
that women are still under str@@ ingent monitoring if it comes to what they are allowed to do with their body .
violence against women is a global epidemic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or that cultural and social standards still contribute to a glass ceiling earlier or later in various fields of life to a glass ceiling , and that discrimination based on gender is still passing through the many different countries and beliefs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all of this is aware and known .
I am convinced and I agree twice and triple among them .
I am a black woman .
and nevertheless : when I speak on skin color , on black c@@ is women , on black tran@@ si@@ f women , on black tran@@ si@@ ent women , on black tran@@ si@@ ent women , on black tran@@ si@@ ent women , both in and outside the femin@@ ist movement , had to mention both white femin@@ ists and white inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but all agree that women - all women should come together to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lift up their voices and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ umb@@ aya , my lord &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to achieve gender equality ( some ) of women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they don &apos;t want to talk about it in addition to sexu@@ alised violence , in addition to sexu@@ alised violence , we are exposed to black women on two occasions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or above that black women and women of other eth@@ nic@@ ities and origin are less than white men and women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that black girls and girls with a migration background more often referred to the school than white girls , due to obvious integration problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or that women are exposed to a higher risk of women and women with a migration background , domestic violence and violence among the partnership . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in part , I want all men , all men , and all human beings or any other human rights have the same rights ; on the other hand , I can &apos;t join the white woman in whose center the white woman is , who ref@@ uses to consider in@@ just@@ ices of sex as well as the skin color of a person .
I am de@@ pl@@ eted and won &apos;t fight for my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ femin@@ ist @-@ orient@@ ated sphere , which always rejected me and countless other black women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 1851 , So@@ jour@@ ner compl@@ ained in her speech : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I also refuse to maintain an ide@@ ology in which the black woman is a human and mar@@ gin@@ alised nature . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I refuse to join group@@ ings , which also absorb our customs and customs , to push their eg@@ o@@ centric program . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will no longer try to give white women the importance of over@@ cutting of skin colour and sex . for some of them will still keep the meaning of black women for the femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women try to teach them better . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; although the inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ al femin@@ ism was founded to give women different approaches to a home and bor@@ rowed from white femin@@ ism , the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is still in its name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I draw it out to resolve me and wholly from femin@@ ism , which was called for my dark skin and my status as a woman , instead of having white @-@ femin@@ ist para@@ dig@@ m which is so stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a new phenomenon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now it is more important than ever that we define black women in our own ideas and bring us into the spher@@ es that are created by us for us .
Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ can@@ a bl@@ ur@@ ism : Rec@@ la@@ iming O@@ ur@@ selves ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : how we can defend ourselves ) in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural , mental , mental , physical and even the spiritual elements can be rever@@ ed to make the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists are immediately calling separ@@ at@@ ism and exclusion after they have read these lines , I ask you to inform about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradic@@ tions of femin@@ ist movement , of which the black woman is affected .
in a vag@@ an@@ istic environment I can up@@ lift black women and women of other cultures , because in this para@@ dig@@ m I exist .
I will be recognised as part of this para@@ dig@@ m because of my dark skin and due to my existence as part of this para@@ dig@@ m .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in a environment where my life has neither passed , nor ignored nor rejected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
p@@ add@@ ling against the pollution : the mission of a man to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations
&quot; &quot; &quot; this article by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine which reports special about international efforts to solve environmental problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as part of a content sharing agreement , this article will be published again .
in the past 7 years , Maikel Mus@@ a traveled to Iraq in the past 7 years - mostly with surfing board or in the can@@ oe - with a special concern through the Kurdistan region in Iraq . its mission aims to consci@@ ously make people realize the importance of clean waters for current and future generations .
in this documentary by Emily Kin@@ s@@ key we follow Mus@@ a , who explains to the rivers of the region and the effect of the pollution to his church .
&quot; I really wanted to do something for the river we lost when I was a child , &quot; Mus@@ a told .
scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dust , pollution and un@@ controlled development , will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organisation Water@@ keepers Iraq - a subsidiary of Water@@ keepers Alliance - which is involved and work to protect &quot; the rivers , streams and rivers in Iraq , as well as to support local communities in sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
at the end of the video Mus@@ a summar@@ ises the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we had no water , how would we survive ? &quot;
this video was filmed and edited for En@@ sia by Emily Kin@@ s@@ key , one in Er@@ bil , in Iraq based documentary filmmaker and multimedia journ@@ alism , produced , filmed and published .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the emphasis on their work is followed , little considerable sub@@ cultures and presents itself through the use of co@@ operative video photography and new multi @-@ media techniques , with their help de@@ pressed con@@ greg@@ ations to tell their stories in their way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Paraguay women and her difficult fight against violence
&quot; &quot; &quot; a group of women poses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The crying women &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to express their pain on the women &apos;s moral in the country and in the region to show their re@@ jection . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is the shortened and worked version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; the article belongs to the series # Por@@ ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # sof@@ ter ) , which reports on the violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect the affected persons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a police commission@@ er said A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez , that she could not do anything against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex @-@ partner who would have been violent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the end of her relationship , some time had passed and the police told her statement would be put to the files , but more could not be done .
when a further wife Bal@@ bu@@ ena displayed because of the abuse of abuse , A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez also used nothing .
a few days later the second wife moved their ad back .
breaking the v@@ icious circle of violence against women is difficult .
if women ask at all once , they generally do not get support from the state .
in many cases , women may also be fin@@ anci@@ ally dependent on the men who abuse them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women admit to be victims of violence to be victims of violence at all in the prosecution authorities .
inhal@@ t@@ 1 Sle@@ eping and Statist@@ ical 2 In@@ visible Mis@@ use and a legal system that does not sub@@ int@@ end any of Paraguay : good approach , lack of execution and statistics
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is hard to determine how many women are really ab@@ used , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says My@@ rian Gonz@@ á@@ lez , a researcher for the social research institution in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are various statements and reports which show the extent of gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the numbers available are al@@ ar@@ ming .
in 2015 , at the At@@ tor@@ ney General , there were 9@@ 600 ads because of domestic violence . at 70 % of it went about violence against women .
86 % of the advertis@@ ements by the police came from women .
there were more than 5000 ads for domestic violence at peace hist@@ ories . 86 % of the ads were given here .
in the ads , 40 % of women were physically har@@ assed , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse .
however , these statistics do not show the true level of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ian women &apos;s Minister Ana Bai@@ ardi will see only few of these off@@ ences even though . &quot; on every woman who will not do this for psychological abuse date , 9 women who do not do this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on every woman who will be reimbur@@ sed for physical abuse , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two women who do not do this &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; stated at the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since women &apos;s murder is not an own crime , the prosecution authorities cannot document appropri@@ ately , as many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners .
by August 2016 , journalists killed at least 12 cases of traff@@ icking in the country .
the coordin@@ ator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases , in which women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates , Paraguay died every ten days a woman because of violence caused by men .

invisible mis@@ use and a legal system that will do nothing .
Mariana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z was the strong friend of Carlos Vera , he insist@@ ed that she named him the names of all her former friends .
at the beginning , she didn &apos;t want to do it , but she wanted her to repent .
today Mariana 28 is 28 years old and no more with Carlos . but for two years she carried the psych@@ ic violence on its part - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult :
I have never thought that I would once be victims of abuse .
if I read about it earlier , I always thought that this is only women who are subject to di@@ lap@@ id@@ ated , because they are dec@@ ei@@ ving of violent men .
I was convinced that this would never happen .
Mariana used social media to report about the abuse by Carlos Vera .
on Facebook , she wrote posts on Facebook in which she described his ins@@ ults and various attacks during their two @-@ year relationship , and told how he was isolated .
many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked to rhetor@@ ic if he ever raised her hand against them and refused to admit that his behavior was also a form of abuse .
other Facebook users survey@@ ed Mariana , why they liked it so long by Carlos and didn &apos;t leave it earlier .
it seemed almost as they wanted to say that victims of mis@@ concep@@ tions would have at least a certain complic@@ ity .
Victoria Santos , who was not from Paraguay , fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay , to prove that her former partner was har@@ assed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Victoria is a member of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ o te Cre@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; network ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) which consists of women that are victims of mist@@ re@@ acts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the group , they can talk to others about their experiences , listening to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the women &apos;s statements seriously .
in Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as case everything started with psychological abuse .
her wealthy partner finally managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat them .
Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as advertis@@ ements in the authorities remained without a result and also of their relatives , she got no support .
it led a process against its former partner , who developed into an op@@ a@@ que judicial struggle between Paraguay and its home country , where it mainly went about money , power and influence of its former partner .
Paraguay laws : good approach , lack of implementation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay , there are many laws which are very good but not applied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message of abuse is a way of resistance and a fight against corruption in justice &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Victoria Santos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , also sees major problems in the application of laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 , a bill was discussed under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ El@@ la ( # Princip@@ le ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # Non@@ Un@@ less ) are part of a campaign on Twitter that is supported by Am@@ nesty International .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the original design of the law looks before Fem@@ izi@@ d to explain to an independent off@@ ender and harder to pun@@ ish as it is the case in neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the legisl@@ ator has changed in some points to win the de@@ pu@@ ties to the law , that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions , which are currently banned in Paraguay , and sentenced to five years &quot; imprisonment &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the original draft law had en@@ vis@@ aged the majority of the ( bureau@@ cratic and economic ) process of proce@@ eding to bear the victims of violence by themselves , if they would like to pay a safe accommodation to the state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ech@@ au@@ ri argu@@ ed that the law is not effective if the legisl@@ ator does not provide sufficient financial means :
in Paraguay , mis@@ use is seen as part of human relationships .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must take place where violence is no longer regarded as a little bit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who are silent about this facts , and contributes to the perpet@@ rators of the perpet@@ rators .
we need to refund so long display until mist@@ re@@ ation is not regarded as normal .
on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Senate . before , parts of the law had been changed , however , among other things , a passage in cases of domestic violence was called for reconciliation .
opinions about the changes go apart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the section regarding reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor , to attack his victim again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cancellation of the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gender &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; political force &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is considered a great set@@ back . &quot; &quot; &quot;

independent media in Oman a year after prohibition of a newspaper continued to attack attacks
&quot; this website was closed due to a decision of the Information Minister , &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &apos;s homepage is on the homepage of the banned newspaper Az@@ am@@ n .
more than one year ago , the om@@ anic authorities closed the independent Arab @-@ speaking newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of their coverage on corruption in the Sult@@ ant .
You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues to be in prison where he served a prison sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , Ibrahim Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and zah@@ er al @-@ Abr@@ i , were also arrested and placed before the court , but later released .
Oman has ruled over the power since 1970 by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn &apos; , who came to power after he had depos@@ ed his father , Said i@@ bn &apos; Ta@@ im@@ ur .
since then , in addition to his role as a single Sultan , the most important offices in the country : Prime Minister , Defense Minister , chief commander , Minister of Defence , Foreign Affairs , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the Sult@@ ans of the Sult@@ ans is characterized by the persist@@ ently efforts of security forces , in particular of domestic intelligence , including press freedom , restrictions and human rights def@@ ending , independent journalists , blo@@ gger and other activists , in@@ ti@@ mi@@ date and incar@@ n@@ ate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; authorities limit peaceful and legitim@@ ate activities in the area of human rights system@@ atically , and activists , too , their views on the public affairs of the country such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , her closure and the imprisonment of three of their editors last year is a hard blow for the press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper , in which since its founding in 2007 over corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) was reported until they were banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on 28 July 2016 , Security forces Ibrahim Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , chief editor of Az@@ am@@ n , firm , having appeared in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 . in this , it was published about corruption in the judicial authorities and the interference of high @-@ ranking officials in judicial decisions .
in the report , government officials were accused of having put the judge of the Supreme Court in Oman under pressure to raise a verdict in an inheritance dispute .
issue of the magazine Az@@ am@@ n , 26 July 2016 with a report on the front@@ page with the heading : &quot; high @-@ ranking parties bind hands of justice . &quot;

on 3 August 2016 , zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , member of the executive committee , was charged by the Special department and arrested on his arrival by the security forces .
on 9 August 2016 , the ISS drew the Deputy editor , You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j who acts as chief editor after Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ aris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper was closed for in@@ definite period , after the information minister had given the order , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the publication and distribution of the newspaper on every way , including online , will be banned from August 9 , 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the trial was held on 26 September 2016 in Mas@@ kat the first trial in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i .
the court sentenced the three journalists to prison terms and also ordered the final closure of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were convicted of public order due to a distur@@ b@@ ance of the public order , &quot; mis@@ use of the Internet &quot; and &quot; Under@@ standing of the State of State . &quot;
in addition , al @-@ Ha@@ j was also found guilty of violation of a audience ban and s@@ lander .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three year prison sentences and fin@@ es in the amount of 3000 om@@ anic R@@ ial ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . in addition , a year @-@ old occup@@ ational ban imposed on both journalists .
al @-@ Abr@@ i was sentenced to a year jail and a fine of 1000 cen@@ ial ( 2600 US dollars ) after having found the use of an information network to spread material that could represent a danger to public order . &quot;
for Al @-@ Abr@@ i a damages deposit of 5000 om@@ anic R@@ ial ( 13 000 US dollars ) was sti@@ pul@@ ated and released on 22 August 2016 before the verdict of the sentence .
the Appeals Court acquitted Al @-@ Abr@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but Al @-@ Ha@@ j sentenced Al @-@ Ha@@ j to six months in prison .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 after leaving his six @-@ month prison sentence from the central prison in Mas@@ cat . al @-@ Ha@@ j continues to serve his sentence in prison .
the Appeals Court also took up the decision of the Ministry of Information , to close the magazine &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
in spite of the decision of the Court to allow Az@@ am@@ n again , the newspaper looks after attacks by the om@@ anic government .
on 8 January , the Minister of Information made a statement with which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information was personally signed by another statement in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , and with which the Minister proved another time against the decision of the Appeals Court .
the permanent shut@@ down of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which Oman has been viol@@ ated the press freedom in Oman .
further injuries include the closure of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercising of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to put its operation .
due to the continued closing of Az@@ am@@ n and the detention of journalists Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the om@@ anic authorities are still not ready to prepare an end to the press freedom .
the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls on the om@@ anic authorities to :
1 . You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j promptly and un@@ conditional release ;
2. to create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , so that their journalists can follow their work ;
3 . protect the freedom of press in the country and
4 . under all circumstances ensure that human rights def@@ ending and rep@@ orters in Oman have un@@ hin@@ dered their righ@@ tful human rights , and without fear of ret@@ ali@@ atory measures , including stra@@ igh@@ ten@@ ants .
the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organisation , human rights def@@ enders ( also independent journalists , blo@@ gger , lawyers etc . ) in the Gulf region and in ad@@ joining states , supported peace@@ fully and provides protection .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ concep@@ tions
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , with his agreement
medical research in Africa is only rare or not mentioned in the media . thus , it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
for the need on @-@ site medical research there are two reasons : for a lack in the offer of global health system , many medicines and vacc@@ ines decided to cover the special healthcare needs on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ culosis and malaria have become far more serious in the p@@ oo@@ rest countries of Africa than elsewhere , and lacking investment in exploring these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a big problem .
secon@@ dly , research , which is conducted by African scientists , helps build up their own research capacities in Africa . a major role in science and technology can only be eligible for the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Center for Inf@@ ectious diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) .
he grew up in the 1990s in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just as the AIDS epidemic had shown the first serious impact on national health .
he left Zambia for studying in the United States , initially in Louisiana , later in Indiana .
as a post@@ doctoral researcher at the University of Pennsylvania , he resear@@ ched himself on HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the sam@@ ic health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about these research .
( Dis@@ cla@@ imer : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( G@@ V ) : what is your research theme ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment , the focus is on my work on the application of research . thereby I support the sam@@ ic national programme for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
in addition , I just launch a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB , and other relevant path@@ o@@ gens .
G@@ V : what are your opinion of the important current scientific themes in your country and general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there are no basic research here . we only employ solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
this must change , otherwise we will always remain receivers , rather than to be mo@@ vers .
the solutions that we get are often not usable in our environment , and sometimes it is impossible to use it here .
G@@ V : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are supported differently .
it is difficult to find people who come back or hi@@ ther , because the financing and development opportunities are better in other countries .
G@@ V : what is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work which you did not have before ?
RW : basic infrastructure does not comply with standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money , a continuous supply of electricity , water and Internet .
laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import them from other countries .
G@@ V : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there are already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods were taught in schools to improve the situation .
G@@ V : how big is your opinion the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they concentrate ? how can we support the development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there are needs of special academic training , starting at any age .
social sciences , computer science , big data , research of space , health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and inf@@ ectious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will greatly benefit .
G@@ V : can you describe the pros and cons of life as a scientist in Africa opposite Western countries , based on your experience ?
RW : many times are the limited speed , things to do , and the easy access to scientific expertise , which represent challenges ahead .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the system that magazines can make articles accessible only against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , also limited the quantity of available information and speed of research . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the USA to India : how &quot; Open Source &quot; seed producers alter global food production
this article by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the En@@ si@@ a.com website , a magazine which focuses on solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mort@@ on has been bre@@ wed in the USA since the 1980s .
its company offers 114 species , such as out@@ red@@ ded , the first plant which has been cultivated and consumed by NASA ast@@ ron@@ au@@ ts in space .
almost 20 years , Mort@@ on &apos;s work has been made only through his own in@@ genu@@ ity and the question how many sal@@ ads can get limits .
but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s he noticed that there were ever more sal@@ ads patented , and that he could not use them for bre@@ eders .
the patents are not only for individual varieties , but also for certain traits such as resistance to diseases , a special rotor or green or cl@@ utter@@ ed leaf@@ s .
in recent years more such patents have been applied to more plants such as cer@@ eal or cart@@ oons . due to these trends , plant breeding and expert food security concerns the future of food production .
as a passionate member of a mill@@ en@@ nia of ancient tradition , Mort@@ on is still bur@@ dened with salad , but it needs longer , because his work is still imp@@ acted by more restrictions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is , as if there would be a rock of b@@ oul@@ ders , around which I have to be called . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we have to do that now , but it &apos;s a bre@@ ach with the breeding tradition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think these patents are going too far . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if they stand before court , no one can breed a new salad , because all features are already patented . &quot; he &apos;s so good as possible and tries to breed those features , which he wants .
however , he is very careful and tries to use no material that is protected as intellectual property .
it has also been connected to a movement that is growing in the USA and everywhere in the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding ) .
ast@@ ron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have eaten red tubes of the sort out@@ red@@ ded in the &quot; greenhouse &quot; plant and eaten . there we tested whether plants can be grown in space .

it is no co@@ incidence that this name sounds rather as it would come from the IT field and not from the field of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed ) can be inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software , which provides alternatives to copyright protected software .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was established in order to ensure that some plant species and gene are not protected as intellectual property and can be used permanently for plant bre@@ eders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as part of the initiative , called O@@ ss@@ i , US bre@@ eders can also undertake that others can use some of them bred seed @-@ free .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bre@@ eders allow her seed to breed it , and it is not immediately removable - two aspects that are prohibited or prescribed by many plant pat@@ rons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
dozens of bre@@ eders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014 .
dis@@ mal prospects
for emer@@ itus Professor of the University of Wisconsin @-@ Madison and O@@ ss@@ i @-@ member of the board Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are control over seed and the possibility of breeding new plants , both important for food security and environmental protection .
seeds plays a role in larger form@@ ations such as biodiversity , rights of pe@@ as@@ ants , control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bre@@ eders would try to use the latter or only little to use natural resistance to natural resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg emphas@@ ises that the &quot; open source &quot; movement does not work with gene@@ tically modified plants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all kinds of plants could be patented if vegetables , grain , gene@@ tically modified or not , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who wants to get control over the seed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says , and takes care of the increasingly common mer@@ gers in the global agricultural industry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he who wants to buy food markets in August and September 2016 , should also know that the way is bred on how this vegetables are far@@ med . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; nutrition sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative are committed to others to provide seed more freely . in contrast , their pre@@ judi@@ ces are to be patented with seed and plant features .

O@@ ss@@ i supporters argue that the future of food supply is endangered because of the most numerous intellectual property rights to plant material , which thus is always restricted , inc@@ ess@@ antly to shr@@ ink .
Claire Lu@@ by , Executive Director of O@@ ss@@ i , worked in her thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability . she found out that roughly one @-@ third of all cases of cart@@ o@@ ots is protected as intellectual property , which means that it can either be used for plant bre@@ eders either .
for other plants , there are not such estimates yet , but experts like Lu@@ by susp@@ ect that mass@@ aged plants like wheat in even bigger style are patented as a salad or carrots .
a question of view
plants are so bred that they have targeted special features - of such , through which their taste or colour improves up to such , because of them flour@@ ish in certain environments , such as p@@ ests and ill@@ nesses .
ad@@ vers@@ aries of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for bre@@ eders is decre@@ asing by increasingly more patents . however , genetic diversity is currently more necessary than ever since the changed conditions are much worse before climate change .
in an e @-@ mail Monsanto &apos;s spokes@@ woman Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to acknowle@@ dges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsanto &apos;s activities . with a total of four banks and the cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States , the company set up the preserv@@ ation of genetic variety .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it does not contra@@ dict that other bre@@ eders of other bre@@ eders &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promote &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patents and protection of plant vari@@ ance systems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow , as soon as the patent has exp@@ ired . &quot; &quot; &quot;
often they help others to come with another method to come to the same result .
such a protection does not in@@ hi@@ bits innovations , but promotes the public and know more material and know @-@ how . &quot;
Mort@@ on sees the other way : 20 years to wait until a patent is composed , that certainly does not support any innovations .
and if you are waiting for so long to breed in plants , which have been adapted to the modified environmental conditions , one would have lost the fight .
however , the main argument for Mort@@ on is that genetic resources should have been a general well and remain there : &quot; independent plant bre@@ eders have neither the time nor money for such form@@ alities , and mon@@ et@@ ular inc@@ enti@@ ves are not attractive to us .
we want to make farmers easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is what drives us , and it will be impossible if we cannot continue to use the best and latest genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in total , Mort@@ on is disturbed on the concept to patented plant features : &quot; we do not create the characteristics itself .
they form the plants themselves , and as bre@@ eders , we have no idea how the plants do this .
a secret of nature . &quot;
for Carol Dep@@ pe , plant breeding in the US state Oregon and O@@ ss@@ i board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; those who bre@@ eds a variety , also chast@@ ens its own values in it .
those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mono@@ cultures , in which cultivation approaches Her@@ bic@@ ide , breeding into his varieties of this concept of agriculture .
my concept is closely gent@@ ile . &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such that move on international markets , but smaller than e.g. Monsanto s ) patents have to survive the most smaller seed companies , either to survive it or hold it for expensive and therefore not re@@ warding or both is the case .
the independent plant bre@@ eders Frank Mort@@ on is looking for sal@@ ads in its breeding garden .
photo by Karen Mort@@ on .
Mort@@ on is also the view that bre@@ eders would be innovative by avoiding the plant pat@@ ent@@ ative : &quot; it looks like me to produce new efforts to produce new , stronger than companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I need constantly new material for my catalogue , as I know my competitors are selling my varieties in a couple of years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a patent it is protected for 20 years before competition , with which it is quite simple . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; although the USA seem to be leading the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; breeding , but the concept is growing rapidly throughout the world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in India , the centre for sustainable agriculture ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , which itself describes itself as a professional organisation in the area of resources , is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open @-@ source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plant and helps preserve the center with farmers and helps them to breed new varieties that fulfill certain requirements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also supports them to come to &quot; Open Source &quot; seed and sell her own .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German organisation promotes a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; license , which ultimately is a formal and legally binding form of the O@@ ss@@ i obligation for bre@@ eders in the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( regulations for breeding differ from country to country , because the O@@ ss@@ i commitment does not simply become one of one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive branch of the European Union , the European Commission , declar@@ es that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be patented . thus , it speaks against the current practice of the European Patent Office , the patents on conven@@ tionally bred plants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a statement is not yet a law ; now it is in governments of the Member States to put the Patent Office to translate this new line . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2016 , the Dutch Organisation H@@ iv@@ os organised a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , on farmers , operators of seed banking and seed companies from all East Africa came to learn something about the &quot; Open Source &quot; seed movement and the global trend towards developing seed .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for H@@ iv@@ os &apos; program for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems currently declar@@ es that the organization is currently a worldwide alliance for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems to drop the planned start next year .
a combination of environmental protection and development groups ( including H@@ iv@@ os ) , the international non@@ profit development aid organization US@@ C Canada and the action group on ero@@ sion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database about seed and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , has published a report as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - a report . in it it represents the opportunity to exchange and improve the seed policy , so that a stable supply of food can be ensured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the report also highlights the importance of a diverse , local supply with seed for sustainable food systems - a connection , from which Lu@@ by von O@@ ss@@ i hopes to recognize him soon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological food is particularly respected where and how something is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we try to make people clear that there is even more behind her food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the newest c@@ ens@@ orship in Egypt
still , the Egyptian authorities still lock content on the Internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ ni@@ sts .
on the weekend of the 05.@@ August , the Egyptian government closed the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt as well as the Arab world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; August , the network published an opinion on Facebook in which the Egyptian authorities critic@@ ised this step sharp@@ ly and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information Comp@@ lies , despite this attack and the re@@ productive of the Egyptian Law and the Constitution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it has never been so difficult to pursue these goals in this part of the world , it was never as important as now . AN@@ HR@@ I thus has never been so important to overcome this targets and not follow it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we ins@@ ist on it to continue our task . &quot; &quot; &quot;
AN@@ HR@@ I is considered as the first cen@@ sored web site of a human rights organisation in Egypt , after the authorities blocked the independent news page MA@@ DA Mas@@ r , arab@@ ic @-@ language edition of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Al Jazeera network of Al Jazeera because of alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organisation of the wave of web@@ side effects to the victims . @ an@@ hr@@ i one of the main sources of human rights in Arabic language htt@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / N@@ IZ@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
besides the AN@@ HR@@ I , there is no access to the blog of the colum@@ ni@@ sts and Human Rights Studies , Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada .
Zi@@ ada took advantage of his blog for spreading Kolum@@ ba and articles that he does not access websites and media available in Egypt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the blog has been built to circum@@ vent the c@@ ens@@ ation of the Egyptian government , even the goal of an attack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
blo@@ gger , the vend@@ or , too , is home to Zi@@ adas blog , however , is further accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity , after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces during December 2013 , while he recorded a video about the students &apos; protests and recorded a video like the police trained physical violence against two students .
his articles mainly turn around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada commented on the blocking through the government and reflected what it means for him :
those who block blogs is very old , however , in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ att@@ ah al @-@ S@@ isi priority ; and even if the blocking of the blogs may not be significant for the world , it is for me for two reasons :
1 ) It &apos;s been successful to give me the feeling of an siege system ; an arrest , a succ@@ essi@@ vely murder , un@@ loading of the national Security Council , the blocking blogs and any other website for which I worked .
2 ) You have proved that I did not write for nothing . in other words , my words have influence , if only on a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first , I used it to the post of articles to b@@ ypass the c@@ ens@@ orship .
but now , after they have closed it , and have fear of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the mu@@ gs go the way up to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( AF@@ TE ) , Egyptian authorities closed from 24 May to 06 August 133 websites . this resulted technical tests on the networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vod@@ af@@ one and Et@@ is@@ al@@ ate .
AF@@ TE also documented the blocking of providers by creating internet search and private surfing possible , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
AF@@ TE reported in her research :
on Monday , June 12 we noticed how the blocking of Web pages that V@@ P@@ N@@ s began to offer .
such practice suggests the intention of the Government to continue to block content and filter to filter the Egyptian users .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the situation will also be wor@@ sen@@ ed that the cen@@ sored decisions are taken behind closed doors , whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis by which they can proceed against this actions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with c@@ ens@@ orship and who will attack it next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants argue .

day for day news reports in Brazil with glo@@ omy head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of many postcard pictures .
some of this head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot in school , &quot; &quot; Every second day , a police officer in Rio de Janeiro is murdered , &quot; &quot; Die@@ be smo@@ ben pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; President T@@ emer sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , Navy and Air Force to Rio . &quot;
in the middle of the economic crisis and in an en@@ lighten@@ ed financial situation , the violence in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Global Justice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brazilian Justice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says even the United Nations to interven@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports like these are ordinary every day and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; at least the manager of a local newspaper .
thus , published for the detailed reporting on violence in Rio well known newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; on August 16 , the editorial &quot; This is not normal , &quot; where they announced , a new category called &quot; war in Rio . &quot;
all reports on violence in the city are now published there .
the motives for their decision explained the newspaper so :
extra will continue to report about crime that will happen in any major city on the world like murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexu@@ al@@ ab@@ rupt , etc . everything , however , is published in the heading &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the only alternative that we as journalists did not close our eyes before the cru@@ el@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a four @-@ minute video that was shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes said that this decision was not an occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure :
extra is probably the only newspaper on the whole world with a war ru@@ bri@@ k in a country that didn &apos;t recognize the war .
in the same video , a journalist in the newspaper explains that according to the Institute of Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro 8@@ 43 territ@@ ories that are controlled by crimin@@ als organizations .
in the Editorial , the newspaper writes further :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are aware that a war dis@@ course , if it is dist@@ orted , will also be used to susp@@ end cru@@ el@@ ions of the police , who is only shooting and then ask questions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but we defend war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose goal is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the Mafia and its partners .
does the term &quot; war &quot; harm more than it ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ cept Brasil , journalist Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira has argu@@ ed the violence as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; war &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; in their opinion , it was a just@@ ification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult to take charge of the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a war .
this is the result of corruption and worse planning - such as extra in the analysis of military interest rates in Rio itself - in combination with non @-@ sufficient investment in staff , recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance and historical and sel@@ f@@ ty neg@@ lect of public service .
reminder : the state of Rio de Janeiro is greater than just its capital .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Rio de Janeiro as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most violent place in Brazil &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is false : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 22 of the 30 violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics from 2015 in the north and northeast of the country . these are the latest available data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of these cities is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
if we look at the M@@ ord@@ rates per state , Rio is on No.@@ 16 , &quot; she writes .
extra belongs to the company Glob@@ o , the largest media company of South America , which , as Cec@@ í@@ lia , emphas@@ izes the security policy of the state for years .
to these safety measures , the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia Pac@@ if@@ ic@@ ad@@ ora ) , one of the federal states of Rio in 2003 , whose objective is to capture a fav@@ ela by using a massive police infl@@ ating and a unity permanently .
at the beginning , this was actually lead to a decline of violent deaths . but for a number of years , the U@@ PP came to more reports about Sch@@ ic@@ ans and re@@ pres@@ sions against the poor con@@ greg@@ ations , which should actually protect the newly created police unit .
on his Facebook page , the journalist João Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux dating from an article from 2010 , where he explains why the violence in Rio is not determined by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; besides legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio will change as a result of serious consequences for the human being . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; because this calls for the state to be typical for a war . this is the in@@ tru@@ sion into the territory of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enemy &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which a civilian is a sharp point in the countryside and an object for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ir@@ reversible balls &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
war or her , fact is that the inhabitants of fav@@ elas will continue to suffer from Rio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a week , it is now that police attacked the mountain with the fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho , in order to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the midst of all this violence this incident occurred : an or@@ char@@ ist died as a result of a kiss that the police had fired from a hel@@ ik@@ op@@ ter .

to stay alive : Ch@@ ag@@ ated Syrians learn to plant mushrooms
screen@@ shot from the advertising video .
source : Can@@ Do@@ Action
since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the following civil war many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime towards loyal troops .
according to victories Watch , a joint initiative of the Organization &apos;s PA@@ X and the research institute The Syria Institute , are located in Damascus , and Um@@ land , Homs , D@@ eir E@@ zz@@ or and Id@@ lib currently about a million Syrians in a state of siege .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the region of Eastern gh@@ out@@ a particularly strongly affected is the region of East Gh@@ out@@ a , where an attack with chemical weapons required the lives of hundreds of civilians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition are based on the basis of investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre had been pract@@ ised by the Assad regime . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2013 , these in@@ surg@@ ents controlled areas outside Damascus have stood under siege under siege , which resulted in that inhabitants are on local or through tun@@ nels and control points mut@@ ed food .
by years of block@@ age , traditional foods such as meat have become un@@ att@@ ain@@ able for large parts of the population .
as a counter@@ measure a group of Syrian humanitarian assistance and ac@@ adem@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of Eastern gh@@ out@@ as , as they can plant their own mushrooms as &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot;
they call themselves Gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ nah@@ da and execute the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fung@@ i do not belong to traditional food in Syria and are only extremely rare part of the Syrian cuisine . however , they are an attractive food source for many residents of the besie@@ ged East Gh@@ out@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the board of the Project , Abo Nabil , said to the French news agency AF@@ P :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we decided to cultiv@@ ate fung@@ i , because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cell@@ ars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Ahmed Le@@ ila , one of the organis@@ ers , reports Global Vo@@ ices , that this project has been fighting for three years , and pressed his relief from that it now wins more and more &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to collect money for the initiative , use the humanitarian Crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do in consultation with the NGO Gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ nah@@ da .
it is planned to provide 125 families knowledge for plant@@ ing fung@@ i , so Dr. Le@@ ila to Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the Constitution this article , they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of around 12,@@ 700 € , but will continue to collect donations on Can@@ Do until Monday , 04 . September 2017 .
the initiative is dependent on generators , which keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity of 80 % .
due to the fuel scar@@ city , plastic fuels are used locally to supply generators with the necessary energy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Le@@ ila told Global Vo@@ ices that they began with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; production of the fung@@ al seeds &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before they checked out their quality and if they are suitable for consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then they planted a small mushroom farm in a tub . when this managed , they used a larger tub . and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; teaching farm for the region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they spread mushrooms throughout the gh@@ out@@ a for free .
Dr. Le@@ ila declared that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people for different reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : bre@@ ach of siege . &quot; &quot; &quot;

creating new work@@ places , especially for women working at home .
creating new jobs for people with disabilities that are bound to her home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea in the whole world , so that our success and our fight against the hunger and the siege is visible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experience inspired by people in crisis areas and we can help humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Portuguese Call Justice for Vic@@ tims of fires in 2017
on the 21st of October , several hundred people protest@@ ed in many district capit@@ als in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of fires that were war@@ med in the north of Portugal .
two @-@ two people died and roughly 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the government that the government called for 3 days of solidarity with the victims for 3 days .

numerous videos spread in the net and show images that allow better insights into the events :
the fore@@ se@@ eable tragedy
the aim of protests from Saturday was the demand for better pre@@ ventive and fire fighting measures by the state .
people asked why civil protection was not able to cur@@ b the extent of the tragedy as far as possible .
João So@@ ver@@ al of the farmers of Portugal declared the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
after Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão streets and villages were evacu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
they did not do this Sunday : there are dozens of streets of open roads that were surrounded by fire .
in the forest of Lei@@ ria a similar tragedy could happen again as in June , as the streets were closed very late . &quot;
furthermore , construction permits in locations with high bran@@ dr@@ is@@ iko are question@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an extensive proposal for the wh@@ aling form , which had introduced the government after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was ob@@ jected by the mun@@ icipalities which saw the new rules as an obst@@ acle to investment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government introduced a loos@@ ening of the law , if the applic@@ ant had in case of case allowed the applic@@ ant on means of self protection , so that it was an open door so that everything was built , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; João Sor@@ val continued on the same article in the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Environmental Organisation Quer@@ cus pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus trees made of slightly combust@@ ible wood , as in a v@@ icious circle , according to fires of this species always spread .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to these problems , the website of the civilian protection from Portugal on 15 and 16 October when people sought information or tried to contact people offline . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was a private initiative that supply the population with information : they used their own civil protection data using the f@@ og@@ os@@ .@@ pt application and informed the population in real time across the location and spread of fires .
the project was founded in 2015 by the developers of João P@@ ina , in order to simpli@@ fy the work of the fire brig@@ ade and was so crucial that the server followed the ons@@ lau@@ ght of 400@@ ,000 users who did not stand out : the site counted more than half a million times .

the Way from Afghanistan for successful entrepren@@ eurs

in one night in the autumn of 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan began with the Taliban .
two years ago , a terrible civil war broke out between the different Mu@@ ja@@ he@@ din groups that had conquered the short @-@ lasting pro @-@ Soviet government . it was Afghanistan to become a country of terror and despair .
at that time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , belonged to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in Central Afghanistan for the last time together with his family at dinner .
even if his mother never said it then , she knew she was no longer able to see her son anymore - maybe even more .
in the morning , the boy should break up .
his uncle would pick him up and bring him to the locks .

CC @-@ 2.0
Abdul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the Party of He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat , had just been murdered by the Taliban , and many Haz@@ ara felt suddenly .
the Taliban for their hatred came closer to Haz@@ ara &apos;s well @-@ known Taliban .
many Haz@@ ara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape A@@ shar@@ af found himself in Pakistan .
for a few years he worked in a coal mine . the work was heavy and made him sick .
then he took what was left of his low salary , and went to Iran . once again he was in a foreign country together with other refugees and tow@@ ed sacks with mort@@ ars who were heavier than he himself to earn his li@@ vel@@ ih@@ ood .
the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was characterised by mis@@ ery and exploitation .
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; A@@ shar@@ af in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afghan refugees ) lived in an empty building on the building site , where we worked as well .
there were no services there and no heating . we suspended nylon before the open window so that we cannot hear at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left his life without Pap@@ ers in Iran and made herself ready for the journey to Europe .
during the dangerous crossing on the sea he suffered ship@@ wreck and stran@@ ded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek Auth@@ orities had rejected his asylum request , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 .
some time was A@@ shar@@ k homeless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church who shared twice a day out of cooking .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s true that Italy is a kind of second chance for exp@@ ired asylum seek@@ ers . however , it is true that the conditions that asylum seek@@ ers are pre@@ cat@@ astroph@@ ic in the country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Human Rights Organization of the Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system suff@@ ers from a general lack of transparency .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the vast majority of asylum seek@@ ers is housed in more than 3000 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special reception centers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; this is impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared staff . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be assigned to a admission centre , if they officially en@@ forced a request for asylum , which can still go for months after the registration of the asylum seek@@ ers .
until then , people who have no money for accommodation , to either rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street .
so there is also A@@ shar@@ af .
but his immort@@ al life has helped A@@ shar@@ af to free himself from these conditions .
after he had made several years of work in construction industry , A@@ shar@@ af hid his total savings in the formation of a host@@ els in Venice .
this was so good that he opened a second hostel and a quick lim@@ bic after a while .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis Success Story is now the theme of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director Am@@ in Wah@@ id@@ i .
the film won the Venice City Award , which was awarded in 2017 for the 24th time .

the conditions for entrepren@@ eurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Italian - are very difficult .
much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are only some of the obstacles .
according to un@@ official estimates , some 20,000 Afghanistan live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a trans@@ itional solution on the way to other European countries .
in recent years some of Afghan companies , including tail@@ or , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice Ham@@ ed Ah@@ mad@@ i had the idea of its restaurant Orient Experience in which the wa@@ iter and kitchen staff were mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant is told by the various Afghan , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes , the history of their journey to Italy .
the Afghan entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the restaurant Peace &amp; amp in Padua ; also behind the pizzeria Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na in Bologna and a s@@ ushi restaurant in Rome also Afghanistan .
A@@ shar@@ af@@ s aims to go far beyond the Italian food industry and the retail , and aim back to the country that he had forced to leave as teen@@ ager .
&quot; where a risk is , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan .
I never forget my country and I cannot live happily when I know my people suff@@ ers .
I plan a project for pe@@ as@@ ants from the p@@ oo@@ rest provinces of the country , especially for women .
they represent the half of the company and must get the same possibilities as all others . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ af also for@@ ged plans for opening a factory in Kabul , where people can learn packaging and preserv@@ ation techniques . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they can sell their harvest excess on the market and improve their financial situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the development of the successful entrepren@@ eurs was a journey through in@@ security and doubt , but at the end , stability and prosperity are .
A@@ shar@@ af made this journey itself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Egyptian Parliament ass@@ ess@@ ments a bill to see that users can only use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after a registration with a government authority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
users would need to be able to use social networks within six months after a succ@@ es@@ ful legisl@@ ature order on the website of the authority , indic@@ ating their full name , as well as their ID @-@ number .
those who missed this move could be sentenced to six months of imprisonment or en@@ rol@@ ment of a penalty .
the law , which was advert@@ ised by sixty members of the Parliament , lies on the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and shall be deb@@ ated there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in May , another deleg@@ ate filed a bill in the tou@@ g@@ her pen@@ alties for the ins@@ ult of the President or a high official . &quot; &quot; &quot;
under Egyptian Law , the siege of the President as well as government institutions is already pun@@ ish@@ able . in this case , such a deed would be prosec@@ uted with prison and money pun@@ ishments , such right wing @-@ experts at the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East policy .
if the law should be adopted , this may mean up to three years in prison for the convicted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , this would be a political climate , in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of freedom has been in danger already for many years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud subscription Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) that was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he had captured Egyptian police officers , while demonstr@@ ating violence against protest@@ ers , who led to the military coup against the elected president Mohammed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan waited so much more than 700 protest@@ ers who had been arrested during the same incident , four years in prison on a court date .
recently , his trial was post@@ pon@@ ed on May 20 , because the sentence was failed , according to human rights groups , accused the accused of prison in the cour@@ tro@@ om .
Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups are involved , head@@ lights from among others , weapons of arms , illegal gathering , murder and attempted murder .
in another case , a Criminal Court in G@@ iza spoke out the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were accused of their coverage for pro @-@ Mor@@ si seat block@@ ade on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya in Cairo .
the court also reduced the pen@@ alties of the journalist Abdullah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested at the previously mentioned incident , from 25 years to 5 years .
tun@@ es@@ ian activ@@ ist to be heard through @-@ soci@@ able documents
in May , Tunis@@ ian authorities spent six hours with the sound of Sami Ben G@@ har@@ bia , who co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia has mainly heard a consistent action plan . Bes@@ ag@@ ter &apos;s plan was supported by the President of the Republic , according to the plan , accused of business@@ men and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of the corruption official am@@ nesty , unless they return all un@@ justified funds .
the document published on April 21 on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at casts a light on how splendid plans look out for the support of the bill .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia rejected the nam@@ ing of his sources indic@@ ating article 11 of the Tunis@@ ian press code which sec@@ ures the right to protect their sources .
nevertheless he joined the Tunis district court in Tunis , on May 09 as a witness .
will China force the users of social media to present their ID ?
according to new rules on the Office of Information Council of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China require permission to write or share news in social media .
in the regulations , the registration with the full repe@@ al name will be required .
analysts agree that it should be achieved by the elim@@ ination of anonymous comments in entertainment within social networks . it is un@@ clear until now the authorities will apply these regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chinese citizens have proposed in social media to asser@@ t these regulations only sel@@ ective to protect the journ@@ alism and independence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
will we see you in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
may the state c@@ ens@@ orship of Russia closed the access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat .
according to Ros@@ kom@@ n@@ ad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat is used to sign up with the regional government as &quot; organis@@ er of the information Pro@@ lifer@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this term is part of a law from the year 2014 , thanks to the Russian government organis@@ es a list of online services . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the law also allows the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; publication of the Information &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; the law also allows for removing contents and force them on request for the suspension of user data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to these websites currently belong to websites such as V@@ contacts and Od@@ no@@ fe@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two arbit@@ rar@@ est social networks ) , the image board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the e @-@ mail service mail@@ .ru and dozens of other services .
Turkish court with blocking Wikipedi@@ as
a Turkish court had the blocking Wikipedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia administ@@ rators refused to delete two English @-@ language articles , which indications , Turkey support the jihadists in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , maritime Affairs and communication existed , as it was closed to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a source of information that deals with groups to attack a political de@@ fam@@ ation campaign against Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first time that Turkey has blocked the website completely . it is , besides China , one of the few countries around the world , in which access to Wikipedia is not possible .
great Britain can &apos;t stop , fl@@ atter@@ ing
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after this week , the UK government is in a targeted consultation with increased surveillance powers , the Internet service providers would force to monitor communication in real time and encryp@@ t back@@ door programs which de@@ cryp@@ t data encryption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the government has cons@@ ulted with t@@ elecommun@@ ications companies and intelligence agencies , but has left other technology companies and the civilian population outside .
despite this the consultation process continues until 19 May . reactions and proposals by members of the public can be for@@ warded to the Ministry of Interior .
