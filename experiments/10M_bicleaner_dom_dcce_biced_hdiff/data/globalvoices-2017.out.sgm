<seg id="1">Although I visited the USA for at least once a year since 2012, I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love to America is extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="4">As many of my generation I grew up with American movies, I danced American music and operated American writers and operated for his sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I was mainly inspired by an American film.</seg>
<seg id="6">When I was 14 years old, I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican Letter, a fearless reporter who was with the help of Julia Roberts as a Jura-Student, who had inclined the Supreme Court with judges who had inclined his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was prisoner.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "according to Method Man," "" "I was like that the absolute truth is, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona had only intensified my admiration for the US.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "I always said," "" "America is the only country where I have ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting you can always be that you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of equal people." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">I had even written a very warm love letter about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">A lot was written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most unusual aspect of its ascension is for me, as he goes with his bottdie.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never stops behind the mountain, as you say so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he thinks, as a former colleague expressed it, and publicly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, AfroAmerican and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, people have responded to his testimony and tuned in droves for him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won with republican elections, was the highest number obtained by the nominees of the party.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans, who support this bigal person, I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not line Trump and his voters in line with the people I had met in Phoenix during my time.</seg>
<seg id="22">For example, my Professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, Director of the Journalism Program, the People from all over the World, a deep-believing man, with whom I could talk about Islam and his past.</seg>
<seg id="23">Also, Trumps would not agree with Peter Bhatia, the present editor of the "Cincinnati Inquirer," agreed.</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours in order to watch the "Phoenix Suns" in the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trumps Intolerance is also about the contrast to generosity that I experienced at Sandy Bahr, who fought for her life long the environment, and her husband Dave, my host family that treated me like her son.</seg>
<seg id="26">Yet it fits to the engagement of Kristi Kappes, who always helped with much patience and grace to me and my colleagues helped us to accustom the complexity of the American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then Andrew Lecco, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wise Council helped me a lot in my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and those affected by them are deepened my love in America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump came to nominate his way to the nominated republican presidential candidate, they offered me a stop and the equivalent of his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On November 8, 2016 over 50 million Americans, mostly White, the Presidency of a man, despite - or maybe due to his contempt towards non-white men.</seg>
<seg id="32">Confronting with the idea that people voted for trump, because they either shared his racism and fanatism, because they were ready to oversee these things, almost the heart broke my heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Maybe it is unfair to call the Trump voters as a shave.</seg>
<seg id="34">To arrange the people, one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "this is superficial and respectful and implies an inability to understand those who act in a different way and think." ""</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows the people that their worries and fears are not taken into account regarding the hectic changes in their communities.</seg>
<seg id="37">"" "" "" "could it be that those voters have voted for trump, because they want to regain control over a country they are disappointed?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they would perhaps want to say that they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe. perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, you can hardly forget the words of David Remnick who comments the cruel decision to raise a man who look down with contempt for those who look differently than he.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "this" "" "Whitelash" "" "(Anm. Ü.: as much as" "" "white against all other ethnicities" "" "; word game from white in play on the whites and whiplash, which means that great Van Jones has been killed exactly what America has made so great." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciated the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality, it is still a powerful idea - what faith or background you may always have, America welcomes everyone.</seg>
<seg id="43">Because this country chose as its President, twice the son of a Kenyan, its history, as he says himself, nowhere else in the world would be possible.</seg>
<seg id="44">However, with the election of Donald Trumps, there is a huge portion of the White America promise, saying: hell with diversity, religious freedom and the whole term of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In the America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the Ruder, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">"" "" "" "with all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq and what he said on the eve of election." ""</seg>
<seg id="47">At a rally for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a change of vocabulary with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, had my son, captain Humayun Kahn, had a place in your America?" he asked Mr. Khan.</seg>
<seg id="49">The crowd answered with a loud "no!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"could Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" the crowd had roared.</seg>
<seg id="52">"have Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered.</seg>
<seg id="54">Have Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" they cried and their voices were louder.</seg>
<seg id="56">"could anyone, who doesn't like you, a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a vocal and vocal "NO."</seg>
<seg id="58">"" "Mr. Khan concluded with the words:" "" "thank God, Mr. Trump, is not your America." "" "36 hours later he was replicated." ""</seg>
<seg id="59">The land, for which his son was fallen, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">That is now Trumps Country, said the message.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people that look like Mr. Khan, could no longer find space in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks me my heart.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero congregation in the Province of Oaxaca, with the children of the Paraguay city Cateura in common?</seg>
<seg id="70">That the music that is played on both places is not only changed the life of children, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music, who lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump, only 16 Kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial town that is very popular among tourists - but worlds from the nearby magnificent ruins and its world-famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For a few years now the La Banda de Música (musical bande) in the village: a symphony orchestra which has a possibility of overcoming poverty has been found with their musical instruments.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become the central interest for the municipality of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The community located in one of Mexico's poorest provinces, is known for its drug abuse and banden violence.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot, who started a musical project and the youth had a rare hope of hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously, the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI comments:</seg>
<seg id="79">As soon as they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to follow their big passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They always come and with shiny eyes and play with shiny eyes and play day for day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, timbreach, Bongos and the conga to play.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from garbage</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7.000 kilometers south of Vicente Guerrero are the children of Cateura - a village that lies practically on the largest garbage dump of Asuncion in Paraguay, on instruments which are made from recycled waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with reprepared instruments, which consist of local solid waste materials, produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recycers have begun to transform pieces of waste in instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments imitate violins, viola, celli, double basses, guitar, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and percussion that were all produced from garbage.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire comprises classical music, folk music, paraguayish and Latin American music and music of the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article of the Los Angeles Times Favio Chávez, a local ecologist and musical instructor of the children of Cateura, at the beginning time:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no place for rehearsals and we had to teach in the same place where the children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them do not live with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">That changed as Favio a little bit showed what he had never seen before: a violin made out of waste.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today, there is an entire orchestra which plays on instruments from reprepared material and called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "a documentation called" "" "Landfill Harmonic" "" "(Harmonic garbage dump) shows the musical performance:" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">Every year, the world generates about one billion tons of trash.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and live by him are the sleeves - like people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn it into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra with his inspiring spectacle from rubbish-to-music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra has even played his music before Pope Francis:</seg>

<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that focused on international, practised solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">The re-release happens in the context of an agreement with Global Voices for shared use of content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa, the ship was already known that this ship had already been powered by illegal fishing in liberationic waters, before it was searching the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">"" "" "" "the East African countries were consequently raised and slightly inclined to welcome a law in its coasts." ""</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Komres, Mozambique and the Seychelles mobilize quickly against the ship. they refused to gain one of their harbours and refused to share a fishing steadress.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "" "" "suddenly the Premier is surrounded by countries that you simply refused," "" "Benedict Kiilu remembers a leading employee of the Kenyan fisheries authorities. he is part of a team that discovered the ship during his time and followed." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013, the ship was driven out of the waters of the region: it was not successful to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">Finally, it was compelled to pay 2 million US dollars in Liberia because of pillage the country's fish stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, crossing the criminal practices and protects resources, FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NRO Stop illegal Fishing (Illegal fishing) was founded.</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network are in addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the six countries who had already expelled the Prime Minister from their waters.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "" "" "we have eight countries, the same minded people and work together. they exchange information and stand out each other where it comes to illegal fishing," "" "says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trust Ending illegal Fishing. this project offers FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is imited by definition: what is captured, is hidden that it is extremely difficult to track down because it is illegal fishing a leading cause of overfishing of regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">By deliberate abuse of existing laws, which should be protected by certain habitats and types, the illegal fishing ecosystem could harm that have a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while actions against illegal fishing once were hindered by bureaucratic hurdles and also by the snail-pace, with the information between individual countries, the actions nowadays occur in real time, with traceability on FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There, for example, individual countries can exchange opinions of existing licenses, news on suspicious activities or details that you had noticed or experienced during a port inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i is also very attentive to the activities of ships, if they move on the open seas, by satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This allows the authorities to identify ships that fish in banned areas - such as suspicious driving routes - such as such that a ship invites his caught fish to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such studies show whether the participating ships have a fisheries license where they were traveling and possibly even if they have a criminal register.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegal fishing, may refuse to accept such ships in their ports. what means that the ships cannot be selling their cargo. and that they may even be forced to pay off penalties, as in the prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "it's then about substantial financial losses for the owners, which means the illegal fishing catch is financially worthwhile." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">And that is what we want to achieve, "says Per Erik Bergh, Director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consulting firm supporting the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The already mentioned platform was created to win an estimated 20 million USD in lost turnover, which will lose eight members of the network HISH-i every year because of illegal fishermen who penetrate in East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fishing spots that attracts the region's commercial fishing in all over the world. among these, those illegal fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">These practices include actions such as the sailing under false flag, fake license papers, specifying identikit species, fish protected species and fishing in reserves.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "" "" "they take advantage of the lack of international cooperation and make the weaknesses of a non-seamless control system," "" "says Long." "" "earlier one ship was illegally fishing and a country could say 'You mustn't walk along my port." ""</seg>
<seg id="124">"" "but another country could say 'Come to me'." "" "and this legitimate loophole tries to close FISH-i now." ""</seg>
<seg id="125">So far the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 studies in suspicious ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has uncovered criminal networks, which had counterfeit licenses in Tanzania. these discovered ships who used several fraudulent identities and has found winged ships and found.</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to his cooperation with Interpol, the international authority for combating crimes, FISH-i can share information on illegal fishing across large distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "" "" "some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks organised crime," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that can help FISH-i to provide suspicious ships.</seg>

<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite-system, which will always be developed further, helps also hiding the illegal ships to hide themselves.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position," "" "says Duncan Copeland, head analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, a NGO which also deals with fisheries data and FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships can switch off their automatic identification systems, with which they can no longer be ordered by satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland helps to build a system that connects different information levels. it should help FISH-i to find criminal ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But FISH-i's team may actually influence the global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth opened together with Google and the Maritime conservation organization Oceana opens the platform Global Fishing Watch: a platform that allows satellite data to be displayed worldwide by the position of any tracking ship worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "to accumulate with the neighbors to get a better picture of it, who knows what is doing - this is just sense," "" "he says." "" "here is a chance for countries to unite and make their resources for an investigation." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "we should do this in a global level." "" "Pew Charitable Trusts has a similar project with which a global system allows the persecution of ships." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities did not only feel criminals but put it off.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships which previously exploited without license and barely have to reckon with consequences, know that they are observed.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu some of the countries involved in FISH, some 33% increase in fisheries sales, since many fishing boats bought more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i Somalia had assisted Greko 1, the inspectors found there on board tow nets, whose use is forbidden.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"" "other countries also notice this successes." "" "the effect is so strong that other countries will now copy us," "" "says Kiilu." "" "in West Africa, several hundred million dollars will disappear every year." ""</seg>
<seg id="148">"" "there are six countries together in 2015, at the so-called West Africa Task Force. they also fight against illegal fishing, according to the same model as FISH-i." "" "safety is the aim of creating more such initiatives and structures in other regions," "" "says Copeland." ""</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently, FISH-i's latest member country Somalia was able to report his first big triumph: in October, there were Greko 1, a ship which was under a false flag. and not only was the ship used without license and have been banned towing networks which are now prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="150">"" "the ship was also entered into forbidden waters, reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "" "with the rules of Somalia, these were a strong sign that they proceed against illegal fishing," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>

<seg id="204">He kept the family secret for 34 years.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation at that time I thought that was fine.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a salary.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child with 15 years, you don't notice that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">I could not recognize that my father was a thief, folk music and murderers.</seg>

<seg id="358">A blogger reported about the apology:</seg>
<seg id="359">"" "" "" "we are sorry that older people felt by the insufficient correction (the translation) for our part," "" "said the police." ""</seg>
<seg id="360">The Japanese online news service J-Cast News made a bit more detailed with the phenomenon of the "terrible" older drivers in Japan and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">The word "terrible" has been denounced as an appropriate description of older drivers. according to the police, the share of older drivers who are involved in accidents but are absolutely cause for concern.</seg>
<seg id="362">In the prefecture of Kyoto, for example, in 2005 1.941 of a total of 19.460 crashes were caused by seniors. this equates to a share of 10%.</seg>
<seg id="363">Ten years later, in 2014, seniors 1.803 caused by a total of 11.850 accidents.</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">To overlay two important skills: passive language skills to understand the text, and to present active language skills to transfer him into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires an active control of the target language - something that is the case in motherlanguage. generally, the belief that translators should be in the target language - not in the language language - motherlanguage should be.</seg>
<seg id="379">A French native language should translate into English for example from English to French - not French into English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo of Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ staff with English as a native language, which could produce translations into English. this may be due to misunderstanding, cost, or the relatively low number of English motherspears who are learning Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies, who do not have foreign employees, make translations more firing internally. then the Japanese staff, whose English knowledge becomes the best, become a translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo of Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The veritable and enigmatic sentences that arise by machine translations, show that this technology can not yet replace a human translators. this applies to some languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strangest English formulations in Japan, among them also the majestic prints, which are often used t-shirts or bags, are used only for stylistic reasons - not to be read or understood not at all.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo of Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may be still acceptable or at least harmless. however, from large companies or from the government that have the means to ensure higher standards, you can expect more careful translations.</seg>
<seg id="389">In the future, the city of Kyoto will hopefully make a serious source for their translations.</seg>

<seg id="391">Main page of the portal "Navegar con Libertad" (Freies Surfing) of the IPYS (Instituto Prensa y Sociedad, Institute for Press and Society).</seg>
<seg id="392">On Friday morning, 7 April, Venezuelan Internet users reported that they had no access to the online channel Vivoplay.</seg>
<seg id="393">Later on, other users have signed the internet performances of VPITV and El Capitolio TV also no longer available.</seg>
<seg id="394">Other online stations carried out the protests of the protests in Caracas, which were organized by oppositionist groups, opposed to the government Nicolás Maduros.</seg>
<seg id="395">The protests began in early April, after the Supreme Court cleared the parliament and transferred the Parliament's duties to the executive and the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos Díaz, journalist and author at Global Voices, published the results of a Traceroutes. he pointed out that the connection is glued, and recommended for users to receive VPN (virtual private networks) to access the Internet.</seg>

<seg id="398">It seems that web sites of Venezuelan providers are again locked.</seg>
<seg id="399">This is from the site of @ VivoPlaynet.</seg>

<seg id="403">It is astonishing that it is still cheaper than buying two liters of lionade.</seg>
<seg id="404">The local NGO VEI filintro confirmed that not only Vivoplay is accessible through a blocking of the domain name system (DNS), but also two other online stations. this also concerns the website where the National Assembly transfers its sessions.</seg>
<seg id="405">Former research institutes of the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, had shown that the local internet providers sometimes use DNS. it is a technique to respond to a certain domain of certain domains.</seg>
<seg id="406">If a website is blocked by the DNS, the server responds or refuses the request to call such a website.</seg>
<seg id="407">We confirm a DNS lock: @ eleloliotv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>
<seg id="408">In VPITV, a third locked channel, the transmission was stopped on Thursday, April 6, when the VPITV cameraman Elvis Flores, who performed protests in Caracas, was taken into custody.</seg>
<seg id="409">Flores was defeated, while he was in police custody.</seg>
<seg id="410">He was released eight hours later and VPITV went back to shipment.</seg>
<seg id="411">Although some channels are still accessible via YouTube, it was also reported that the government is regulated by Internet connections: thus Venezolans will continue to continue access to multimedia coverage of the current events of the country.</seg>

<seg id="526">A subtype of the larger family of Leopards, which roams through Africa and Asia, belong to the Persian Leopards (Panthera pardus saxicolor). in total, there are between 800 and 1,000 animals, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature. they are due to wildery, loss and fragmentation of their habitat, as they always find less prey.</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this certain kind of leopard so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">As Raza shows in the video, "the Persian Leopard is the only remaining predatory in the Kurdish ecosystem" and the health and the defunnel of the ecosystem also depends on that a large predatory is present.</seg>
<seg id="529">The chance to see a Persian leopard in fact is small and goes towards zero. as the team in the video therefore noted that she has a recording of a big cat on camera everyone breaks down Raza in pure joy.</seg>

<seg id="544">In early March 2017, the Daily Kahoku Shimpo, the advances that have been achieved for the North-East Japan have been hit by the life of those who have been hit by the "triple catastrophe" of March 2011. a massive earthquake, a tsunami and an atom accident in Fukushima had triggered the disaster.</seg>
<seg id="545">Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, which is located in Miyagi prefecture. the prefecture of Miyagi was a great prefectures in Japan's Northeast, which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighboring nests Fukushima and Iwate were forced, because the tsunami had vanished whole coastal cities from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">Still even the prefecture of Fukushima had a nuclear accident, already alone, 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes.</seg>
<seg id="548">The Kahoku Shimpo special report shows which progress has been reached for six years, in order to rebuild the life of local authorities.</seg>
<seg id="549">The extensive report of the newspaper contains both statistics of the Japanese regenerative authority as well as survey results of those affected by themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">The apartment building in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that by December 2015, a total of 77 per cent of the planned spare parts (the base, saigai kouei juutaku) in the prefectures Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate have been completed.</seg>
<seg id="552">The biggest success among the three prefectures was reported in Miyagi, where 80 percent of the planned spare parts were finished.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, whereas Fukushima represents a total of 70 percent.</seg>
<seg id="554">After the catastrophe more, six years after the catastrophe, was evacuated by domination of domination (standardized, kasetsu juutaku) to relocate in final replacement houses.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the triple catastrophe, nearly 80 000 people were forced to live under control skills.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016, 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate lived in such Behausungen.</seg>
<seg id="557">Nearly 40 per cent of the year 2011 evacuated from Fukushima still lives in emergency, whereas Miyagi was successful. more than 75 per cent of the evacuated houses, who breathed after the disaster, were settled in final houses.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate, the number here is 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The stand of works and everyday life in the three affected prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">Like the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper, 1074 was able to determine from 1100 schools that were affected by misfortune, their doors to December 2016, which makes almost 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, the industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is much more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While nearly 100 percent of the fishing ports in Iwate and Miyagi are back in operation, only 30 percent of the fishing ports are re-recorded in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="563">Tsunami and nuclear accident, have withdrawn the three prefectures of agrarian land in the three prefectures of agrarian land.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi could recover 93 percent of its agricultural areas, whereas only 66 percent of the agricultural land in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed farmland in Fukushima can be re-used.</seg>
<seg id="565">"" "it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the atomic fact that only 690 acres of 5 400 hectares of destroyed farmlands of Fukushima, are in the" "" "nuclear remote zone" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures the tourism subsided again, but also here Fukushima remains unbeaten.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwate are again up to 90 percent of the same level as before the disaster. Fukushima, on the other hand, can have only 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that since the catastrophe nearly half of the coastal population, it is more difficult to earn their livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the indigenous population prepared for the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to determine a picture, the newspaper conducted numerous questionings under the local population and under the evacuated population. she questioned them concerning the state of the reconstruction and also how their feeling towards the tsunami risk has changed.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction of the article, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo led a survey to bring more about the tsunami consciousness among the native population in experience.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey carried out that 83.1 percent of local population resident measures have taken measures to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of respondents say that still not enough in the disasters of disasters has been done.</seg>
<seg id="575">As it stands for those who had to evacuate from the Fukushima prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">In its issue to the anniversary of earthquake, Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has reinforced its attention also to the situation of evacuated Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima had not only had to experience the massive earthquake and devastating tsunami, no, the prefecture of Fukushima had also been a witness to the worst, nuclear disastrous, atomic fact that Japan had to participate.</seg>
<seg id="578">Almost 63 000 people were evacuated outside the prefecture of 160 000 evacuated from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016, some more than 23 000 people were resettled back to Fukushima, in permanent replacement houses.</seg>
<seg id="580">After 2017, 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima still live outside their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the emergencies most of the evacuated areas are most of the evacuated areas, older than 50 years old. they have to be back in proper permissions because they have to compete for the reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima joined by massive construction projects, which are part of the Olympic Games that will be held in Tokyo in 2020.</seg>

<seg id="626">With the introduction of the law of Álvaro Reynoso, almost hundreds of sugar cane factories entered the doors in Cuba (photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">The community of Gregorio Arleé Mañalich, which is located in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - known, regardless of that there are no significant sugar harvesting on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years ago when the activities were lame in the sugar cane factories.</seg>
<seg id="629">After the harvest the sugar cane industry stood still in the region, and the factory lost after and after its installations, until only the rumours of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to reinvent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changed the work.</seg>

<seg id="635">That was something he was not expected.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene recalls exactly to have heard that in Mañalich the sugar cane factory would get, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar cane industry already resisted the plagues, the fall of socialism, the low market prices, inefficiency, bad management decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016 the production was 1.6 million tons of sugar, less than the 1910 produced quantity.</seg>

<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old platform of the community saw better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economical requirement: the 155 sugar cane factories were technically obsolete, and hardly competitive they were immeasurable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production objective was 4 million tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="645">They just left the factories, the sugar for maximum 4 Centavos (0,03 Euro) can produce.</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution to unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives which led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the global market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless the sugar price increased in front of about one decade.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 until 2025, the price of unrefined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the 2016 edition of "Landscapes" by the OECD and FAO, the Agricultural and Food Organization of the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="650">When the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), raw sugar exports would generate about 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>

<seg id="654">In the following years, it came to a total of 98 sugar cane factories, more than 65 million people received their full salaries for further education.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane factory Gregorio Arlée Mañalich on May 14, 2004.</seg>

<seg id="675">When the sugar cane factory closed, or better said than they began to stop them, they also listened to the road to asphalt, but also disadvantaged other establishments.</seg>
<seg id="676">Without a job in the region, and with advanced age, Nene and Eddy had to search other factories.</seg>
<seg id="677">They have become spare parts.</seg>
<seg id="678">Without any future eye view, many young people also left the region.</seg>
<seg id="679">A food factory was created in the area, whose production is not even for the supply of the community.</seg>
<seg id="680">The ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive.</seg>
<seg id="681">At the end of 2016 Nene came back to the factory of Boris Luis Santa Coloma, the ruins of the place where he began to work.</seg>

<seg id="692">Youth of First Nations-Communities in all over Canada deal with themes that are important for them. they are doing hip-hop, thanks to a number of hiking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan tour since 2014, workshop manager mobile audio studios put directly to schools and youth centres, for youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were led by the pedagogues David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked together in Nord-Quebec with ten Cree communities and then worked together with the Cree Hip Hop Group The NorthStars.</seg>
<seg id="695">"" "the workshop is increasing the young participants in talks like" "" "cultural identity, language, meditation, love, self-acceptable" "" "or whatever the meaning emerges." ""</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspired by inspiration for songs and videos in which youths are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Winnebago in the U.S. state of Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">"" "this video of the school" "" "Na Aksa Gyilak'yoo" "" "in the area of the tribe of the kitties in British Columbia example tells the story of the Highway 16, also called" "" "Highway of Tears" "", "a road section in Westkanada, on which almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women were missing or murdered." ""</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were largely incomplete.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motive of a video player to mediate, as important to receive traditional customs and customs despite the influences of globalization.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the young people do not always rule the languages of First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation has recorded, the refrain will be sung in Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved some help from Gary Jolly from Northstars hip-hop group who gave them a verse in the dialect Eastern James Bay Cree.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the facebook site of N'we Jinan the verse is available, as well as a translation into English, which is translated into German:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like I wouldn't be interested in myself</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to keep my days on Earth</seg>
<seg id="707">This is the day you will get our cry.</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we have lost our way in life</seg>
<seg id="709">"" "" "" "but I believe that we will rise one day." ""</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">So they can grow and lead our youth as well</seg>
<seg id="712">Thus, they can do that which determines the Creator,</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan there can be seen before almost every restaurant sculptural dishes.</seg>
<seg id="719">To show potential customers what is exact on the menu, are exhibited in the vicinity of the entrance of shokuhin sanpuru (the base, "plastic models of the courts"), served by any food that is served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers can look at this plastic dishes, then decide whether they enter the restaurant or continue.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is an entire industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">In Kappabashi district of Kappabashi, there is a multitude of these small businesses that produce these plastic dishes, documented by the German filmmaker Wim Wenders in his film Tokyo-Ga over 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese, these plastic dishes are usually taken to them all. a new trend, however, transforms them today in showy mobile accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">At Naver Matomes, the blogger itinii series published by social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sale: new plastic coating decorated with plastic dishes, such as they are shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu Kaufhaus.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial foods have been transformed into kitschy collecting objects, as in this case, fridge magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are some Shokuhin coolbox magnets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom of foodstuffs is increasingly complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case, an imperial-don (a popular rice bowl) was transformed into a cell stand.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as a mobile stand.</seg>
<seg id="731">Also this part we produced for the exhibition in Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple that captures your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple, with a score for the mobile phone, this is already a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And that's just the beginning of an increasing flight into the coma.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile support and mobile phone designers allow you to create your own work of art. in this case, ikura rescuffs is used, a popular topping which is served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter, some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"" "is there someone who would say:" "" "Wow, cool, now I can decorate my mobile phone with salmon?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I'll probably be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appetizing form, to surprise for instance colleagues or family members.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile stand has the shape of melting ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition, there are also rice balls (onigiri), earrings and wristbands from dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">You can view other scanned plastic dishes at: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow on Twitter to the hashtag # 1.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you would like to learn more about the origin of this trends, then this video gives you insight into the city of Kappabashi, which is devoted to the taste of the restaurant industry. as for example with the shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>
<seg id="744">The following video shows how Japanese plastic dishes actually are produced.</seg>

<seg id="750">The coverage of drug bosses such as El Chapo Guzmán, chief of the Sinaloa boxes, urged the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background.</seg>

<seg id="754">Animal Político describes the project so:</seg>

<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a reader of Animal Político, wrote this post from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in central mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Your contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal, in which form it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I have been aware of illness and sensation-journalism now for several years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">I am coming to newspaper kiosks every day and see the title pages with images that are actually only from a textbook for criminology or experts from experts.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only one that is disguessed or sad. it works as a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I can't be indifferent or consider it normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She writes on:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it's not normal that my 10 year old cousin thinks that he is big. and it's not normal to hear people's songs about the "heroic" of the offences, when they walk through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me it is, as if they have lost those who have lost someone and those who have fear that something happens to them too.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness, when stories will become naked numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"" "the inaction of people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring resort is justified by" "" "they were" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they are trying to persuade them to remain spared of such tragedies, if they are not stirring and still.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the article "Four months" extortion in the Capital District: like a family with threats issued by threats, until they were not only destroyed by the business, but they did not only break their family apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you've lost and about how many people can change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain of it passes away, the trauma remains, the fear comes up again when you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, phone numbers also.</seg>
<seg id="794">We just contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The more we are from each other, the better.</seg>

<seg id="799">The journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega published the article "The forgotten children of Ciudad Juárez: a generation of violence signed."</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction he raises questions like: who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">What is it like to grow in a settlement on the outskirts of the dangerous city of Mexicos?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like any other age of his age, whose parents are taking care of them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is a fatherless and he tells us to teach himself how to make a egg, cook potatoes, tortillas warm and "chichi" for the kittens. this is his name for the preparation of the vial with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He talks about the nine fools on his left leg - one for every year's life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - unspeakable for a boy who consists of violence and who had to learn to live thereby.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, one told him that his mother disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But that was not the day that his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood was over two years ago, when he saw only a few blocks from his home, the bloody body of his father, who had been shot by armed men from a passing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez looked like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006, as a force mixed by the organized crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010, Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murder according to public security and government of the United States government.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the public prosecutors was 3103 Morde, representing 8.5 Morden per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are only some of hundreds of thousands of stories that organized the organized crime in Mexico and penetrate the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Just a few stories we still live in the face of the new headlines. but this project reminds us of those who we must not forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" created the data journalism project Narcodata, whose aim is to depict the complex information behind the failed struggle against the drug trafficking, which has tortured the country in the past four decades, in understandable manner.</seg>

<seg id="819">But how is the years since something has occurred? content in social media, no matter whether true or untrue, tends to pass on.</seg>
<seg id="820">Let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its initial release, it was used to show supporting tragedies that actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>

<seg id="823">But there are questions about our desire for pictures on messages.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010, a tank car crossed the place Sange in the East of the DR Congo, kippte around and exploded. 230 people came to life.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war, Africa had been neglected and ravaged for years. the roads in the region became dangerous paths, which were difficult to drive.</seg>
<seg id="827">Tragically, the tanker fell victim to the victims.</seg>
<seg id="828">The Government officials described a fireball, the dozens of houses covered, including a cinema in the vicinity, which was full of people who illustrate the soccer world championships.</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses violated and shortened corpses scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned to ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="831">A picture with the title "This is Nigeria." from the Imgur User Mystical Monkey, 12th January 2015.Mehring photos of the incident form the ugly scenes of this day.</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of hollow body, lined up on the ground, while people watch it.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story doesn't find their end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years, the same photo was taken several times on social media, blogs, and other platforms, but was not attributed to the tragedies, especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What did not happen in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, the Boko Haram attacked the remote villages of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses reported drastically about atrocities, before they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burnt down and corpse were in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">Reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">"" "but the figures could not be confirmed." "" "no one remained behind to count bodies," "" "said a inhabitants to Human Rights Watch." ""</seg>
<seg id="842">Many were crushed, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">Only on the basis of satellite images the following time could be depicted.</seg>
<seg id="844">The reason for the attack was also unsolved, but the army base in Bagha was a permanent conflict between the military Nigerias and the Boko Haram's attempt to win the country (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture emerges from the DR Congo as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack was presented:</seg>
<seg id="846">That is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days to Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this abusive use of the image from DR Congo is only one in a number of misdepreciation; Africa Check has been documented in Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all of these cases the image has been presented as a cover for measures.</seg>
<seg id="852">Another step further bring personal comments such as this example faded the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media related to arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The picture from Sange also appeared in conjunction with the fatal persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a lightning response published by the United Nations, those who have been able to flee, rape and some dead, some caused by burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported from violence against the Rohingya, posts, like the following, brought these descriptions with photos from the DR Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture comes from an acidi-Arab news page that was falsely maintained that President MyAnmars Than being took part in the assassination of the Rohingya Muslims. in addition, she had used the image from DR Congo to describe this information.</seg>
<seg id="857">The original fee, which last was taken on 26 April 2017, can be accessed here.</seg>
<seg id="858">Other news organizations, AFP as their source, were also attributed to Than being attributed to this statement, but did not make the picture taken from DR Congo.</seg>
<seg id="859">The world wide range of false data</seg>
<seg id="860">Traces of these false couplings only go back to the year 2011 and 2012 and actually come from all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="861">Using a "reverse picture search" you can see how far more information can be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="862">A reverse picture search with the search engine TinEye has found 344 pictures (as of May 3, 2017) 344 pictures, which are very similar to the written image of the DR Congo.</seg>
<seg id="863">They come from a mixed masks private sites, platforms of social media and social publications and are available in many different languages such as English, Russian, Spanish, Arabic, Dutch, German, Greek and Portuguese.</seg>
<seg id="864">Some have forwarded the false reports, others have tried to unmasked counterfeits.</seg>
<seg id="865">We have bordered examples for the abused use and associated with the respective countries, based on which page they had been published. thus, we want to represent the range more clearly than by language alone.</seg>
<seg id="866">From the listed countries (which were also associated with each other in some cases) can be used several examples of abusive use.</seg>

<seg id="944">A blog with the name Untranslatable (e. g. immeasurable) tries to offer voice-minded a selection of words from all over the world, which are difficult or not to translate.</seg>
<seg id="945">These words are in every language: they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these irreplaceable words are already well known (as the famous Portuguese saudade) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture (for example, the Spanish sobremesa).</seg>
<seg id="947">But all resist stubbornly every attempt of an easy translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">A word or expression is not enough, which is why a complete explanation and sometimes a bit context are necessary to understand what is meant with this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected in an online list for quite a period of time.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists treat Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words, while the author and linguist of "Untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to concentrate on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">For example, in the blog, one finds words from the Vanuatu Vanuatu, such as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"vakasteglok" - Bemba you for your parents in recognition of how to try yourself in your younger years.</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunsrik language that are spoken in parts of Brazil, as:</seg>
<seg id="954">"kwadi" - The convenience or sloth you feel after having warmed yourself in the sun in cold days.</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds's own words about his blog above:</seg>
<seg id="956">They grind other cultures, unveil other thoughts and wake up our curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="957">"" "sometimes you influence what we want to analyze the world around us and classify the linguists on this site or show more of these" "" "immeasurable" "" "words and show how different, valuable and impressive these small languages are." ""</seg>

<seg id="1136">Can there be a possibility, here and now, despite a language barrier with anyone else?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS) initiative is a possible answer to stories in their original language.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported recently about a different initiative of Steven Bird, the immeasurable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">However, here the focus of TLS is not on the written word, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to obtain the language variety of major cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in Oakland in the United States, where TLS has already performed events since 2015, the risk that small and not quite as little languages will not be shared by the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the makers of the project is:</seg>
<seg id="1142">Mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided if we accept cities - safe spaces in which inhabitants do not need to forget who they are to belong.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "while" "" "listen frequently, these events instead" "" "is to be understood instead" "" "to appreciate, to feel, to establish, to establish," "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, storytellers introduce their story in their own language and translate, or explain them in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are not a professional storytellers, their devotion and visualization will lead to the audience.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They call to laugh and emotions, as if the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows a traditional story of Burkina Faso, which is told in the language Dafing. during this round, the storyteller Rassidatou Conate also takes the opportunity to explain the narrative of the narrative of narrative art.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event John Nyamusara tells the beak of the rabbits and the Pavian in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>

<seg id="1150">You have heard!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were all with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">So far, the events of Treasure Language Storytelling have taken place in three cities, and the organizers hope to expand this. all that are inspired by the project can be in contact with TLS in order to organize their own stories.</seg>

<seg id="1182">The Syrian web developer Bassel Khartabil, also known as Bassel Safadi, has been missed for over a year.</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and family recompose the campaign for his freedom and remind of the contributions which he did for an open network.</seg>
<seg id="1185">At this year's re: publica, the annual conference of digital culture, which is aligned in Berlin, dedicated to the event of the # FreeBassel Campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Mélanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of the German-based CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara Rühling, Managing Director of Book Sprints, a publishing house published by so-called 'Book Sprints' ready books within three to five days, read excerpts from the Book of Freedom: a Collective Insignia (The Cost of Freedom: a collective replica).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book published last year has been released and licensed freely, contains a number of essays that deal with free culture in the face of the oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction, it reads:</seg>
<seg id="1190">"" "" "" "this book would like to discuss how movements for free knowledge will be built and what the real costs are linked to which this is related." ""</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers, researchers, researchers, researchers and authors who have been involved in the movements of free knowledge have to look over the fog that surrounds our newsfeeds and to create some sense from our different experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartabil, the beloved and celebrated internet volunteers, who has been detained in Syria since 15 March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was painted from the Adra prison directory in which he sat on October 3, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then, we have no information about its current state or residence.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice to push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom, instantly.</seg>
<seg id="1196">To see how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture, many of us begin to think about their own fate, deeds and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why Are We Here?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we choose?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we abandoned in this process of time of extreme convictions?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for Open Source and digital activist has been in custody for Syrian government authorities since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015 Bassel was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military institution, to an unknown location.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, the writer and lawyer, Noura Ghazi, reported that the "Military Police Bassel entered the basis of a" strictly secret "commander of the military court of his cell in Adra."</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that she was contacted by persons on 12 November 2015, which presented himself as a Insider of the Assad government and put them in knowledge of an alleged death sentence against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">But its position and condition remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in which access to the internet and knowledge for the around public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and at the moment the director of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of the bass prototypes were looking ahead as the work that he began with a group of archeologists and 3D artists around the year 2005 to rebuild the ancient ruins of Palmyra.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the destination of many civilians and merging greek-Roman architecture types with hiesigen traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">Bassel could not know that ten years after he began to work with this work, the IS was going to put everything that is not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This maturing into the digital archaeology and the preservation has created a timeline, which will be invaluable in the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Tragically, Bassel could not finish this project yet.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi has also contributed to the book and writes about her husband's passion, his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I have spent my whole life to dream of freedom and taught me to embrace them.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel brought me English, even when he was already in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I have learned to read and speak English good, write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with each one who asked. he has taught others to read and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened my door to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He taught me the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also taught other agents such as computers, at least theoretical, without knowing they had in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Waiting), a proxy that she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 when he was in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura have worked together in the book for a year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">They smuggled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated them out from the Arab to English.</seg>

<seg id="1227">Here is an excerpt from the book of Nora with the title "It happens":</seg>
<seg id="1228">It happens every visit,</seg>
<seg id="1229">That I fail in the world of your enchanting eyes,</seg>
<seg id="1230">That I lose the reflection in the moment we embrace.</seg>
<seg id="1231">That every hazards does not matter,</seg>

<seg id="1240">And to cry and smile on your absence.</seg>
<seg id="1241">I bear witness to myself, that I will return soon...</seg>

<seg id="1246">And you are still in the cage of monsters</seg>
<seg id="1247">The story is not unique in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Since the beginning of the protests against Bashar al-Assads in 2011, according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights (Syrian network for Human Rights), more than 65,000 people disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="1249">Those who were arrested or imprisoned under violence by the regime were tortured or even executed.</seg>
<seg id="1250">Until 2016, the international human rights organisation Amnesty International died at least 17.723 Syrians in prison since 2011.</seg>
<seg id="1251">The stories of many other people remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1252">The Global Voices Community has been calling for the release of Bassel since 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1253">Today, we repeat our demand in hope that we have to do this for the last time.</seg>
<seg id="1254">Mozambique: sentenced to previous post due to corruption by corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1255">Mosambique reacted with anger on a corruption incident, where a government member returned to the workplace in the state of the State of the State.</seg>
<seg id="1256">This is the Diodino Cambaza, which was arrested in 2008 and in 2010 together with four other defendants were sentenced to 22 years imprisonment together with four other defendants (approximately 800 000 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public funds of Mozambique by the Council of Cambaza, between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 for good guided tour and immediately called for his return to the company, what happened on April 19th.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with the Attorney General's Office of the Republic, which granted the application, there would be no obstacle reason for Cambaza, because the company had no discipline in custody after his imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many people do not leave the action well.</seg>
<seg id="1261">"" "the centre for public integrity (Centro de Integridade Pública, short CIP), a local institution responsible for public transparency in an interview with Deutsche Welle, condemned the company's decision to establish the director again:" ""</seg>
<seg id="1262">"" "" "" "represents a setback in the fight against corruption and clarify the lack of transparency and is even a step towards the efforts of our legal system, such as the CIP." ""</seg>

<seg id="1265">"" "Egídio Vaz, a significant voice in the Muslim social media, rejects this behavior and considers the case as" "" "contradictory" "" ":" ""</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza would be a competent guy, he would be consultant after he was sentenced to prison and half of them had to eat.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could have paid lectures and motivating words, he could advise and polate his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But as he is incompetent, he has authorized to be integrated into the company, which he helped damage harm.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore, it is obvious: Cambaza is to be paid for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Contradictory!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Mosambiance and student of political science in Brazil, says the director no moral:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza was rewarded by the State because he insulted him, I can't believe that someone has rewarded someone in such a way that the state has already been so massively insulted.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza lack the morality and serve the state, * He had already served a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead only served by the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state, as handing it has become an inexhaustible money source and the state itself is weary of this man, who was pre-loaded and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this man was rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey Zeúte is preferred to remember the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel, remember that a thief belongs to the prison:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Thieves belong to the prison Samora Machel will not only remain in memory for ever and as a first independent president, but also as a sharp, lapping and - next door - prophetic speakers.</seg>

<seg id="1294">But in an effort to fight hystercial in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar 'may normally be associated with racism, but the word itself does not call itself automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that posts, in which they have discussed the use of the word or doubt have doubts the use of his use.</seg>

<seg id="1302">The phrase ku la - "healing" (ku) + the question word (la) on Burmese - resembles the racist expression very, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were various reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Having is the opinion that she will reduce Hasspronunciation of radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook will be analytic, before it deletes all postings to spread racism.</seg>

<seg id="1416">With permission used.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was with the photos that he looked around, never satisfied. they were blurred with badly positioned motifs and washed colours.</seg>
<seg id="1418">That motivates him to carry a camera for himself, and try to dignify the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">Back then he was a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar tries to bring to the international stage as an animal world.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his hometown directly next to Chitwan National Park, it offers the perfect opportunity to shoot photos which focus the attention to Nepalese wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook like this top-class situation in his work helps:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested at home when I called Navaraj (the manager of Chitwan Gaida Lodge). he had received a call from my father that on the banks of the Rapti River a leopard would be.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river damm is just a few minutes from the tourist town of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father had watched him and showed me the place on the other river side, where the leopard was and I immediately started to knit pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar strives to collaborate with the authorities to obtain worldwide recognition for Nepals Nature and wants to deepen understanding that wild animals are not as terrifying as they look like.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know it, because he was the tiger already from face to face:</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger can't interfere with the opinion of sheep anymore!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evenings. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleeping time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">I was also because of darkness on the way home, when suddenly the king of the book appeared. he immediately continues to see us and he stares me through the Sal Trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar placed the logo "I click for Conservation" (lit.: I click for environmental protection) to his photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">However, his passion for the promotion of Nepals nature and wild animals, however, is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days, and lived in a tent in order to take pictures from Otters. up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds, which live near the tourist information.</seg>

<seg id="1470">A revised version was again published as part of a content sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India, there are women with the greatest care to express the name of their husbands or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead, they use a prestige or say "Father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh to respect women that they should respect the husband due to the social pressure, as well as the fear of the consequences, they should respect the norm in life.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year, Malati Mahatoto was convicted by a headlight court and repudiated by her family and the village community after they had addressed a married relatives.</seg>
<seg id="1475">"" "" "" "the tradition also does not call their wives by name, it is also common among men. however, they have far less adherence to fear, if any, they should not follow this practice." ""</seg>

<seg id="1477">"" "" "" "it is a place only for them alone, to discuss and discuss the delicacy of the Patriarchate." ""</seg>
<seg id="1478">When one of 56 clubs found in 13 Indian states, he is part of the campaign # KhelBadal, which is operated by the Community Video Volunteers and relies on the mining of Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Paist has been working for seven years with the help of their video camera on the cover of practices, such as children's homes up to the exile of HIV- and AIDS infected.</seg>
<seg id="1480">She tells us how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and they simultaneously made them to botox inside the wall.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video, the Rohini showed in their discussion round, acted by women who do not call their husbands on behalf.</seg>
<seg id="1482">"" "" "" "she decided on this topic, because she wanted to talk about the patriarchate with a problem with which women can easily identify themselves." ""</seg>
<seg id="1483">The names of their husbands do not speak loudly, it is a Brauch, which they endowed all light and never have questioned questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini means:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who doesn't stand this, is regarded as a crafist, as a woman without moral.</seg>
<seg id="1487">Tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never made thought about this discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini wanted her husband to have never named her name at home, trying to try out how it runs.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband are silent for a long time after the video was finished.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"" "Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said," "" "I should name him from now on his name." ""</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this self-confidence in the luggage of Rohini started their first discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "Patriarchate" never before. some believed that it was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, were protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the lap, Rohini showed a video about the problem at Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection the women tried to bring discussion with a practice.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, upset, sad, loving and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">"" "then she asked them all," "" "If we can't say the name of our husbands, but they can call us what they want, means that they should not respect us?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equivalent? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day in which they brought the name of their husbands on their lips," says Rohini Pac over the course of a century-old tradition, in which women married the name of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1502">One woman was so shy, that during the whole exercise only beamed around; another decided to release the whole frustrated frustration against him and his family by cursed him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Even in the adrenalin rush to have broken with an old custom, the women decided that they would actually try to call their husbands on behalf.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the coming days Rohini received a variety of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas they put to women in his head: his wife could not stop to say his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it during dinner before the entire family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When she was her mother-in-mother, she was afraid, and said that it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">Another woman said, "Rohini said I should do it."</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant in less understanding was less understanding and the situation arted in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports how women have attempted to stop other practices, such as wearing the cinogenic red dot on the forehead, which indicates the spinal status:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women only have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"" "" "" "I said to my husband that I would carry the zinnoberred point if he would do it." ""</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed at only and I was listening to carry him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women didn't stop it completely, but I think they are now in a better position to choose it, not to wear it in some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the discussion lb is a safe place where they can share their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"we are doing a trip for each discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "I don't want to worry about women who could hear what could hear," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last months, they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes; they danced, and spoke about things about which they had never thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for many years and yet I have said about some things, for example like our identities of our husbands, have never been so honestly spoken.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to say certain things loud, no matter how small they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round, we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothing.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have carried only Saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most, this is okay, but some people wanted to carry a Salman-Kurta, a vast shirt over a pants, but they didn't get married.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After a lot of dispute and discussion about the advantages of their own coat-selection, morality is related to the saris and much more, gnatched Rohini her own pair of Kurtas (Oberhemden) in a discussion round so that women were able to carry them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next, they have decided to plan a trip to Goa where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure that they will be able to create it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question of whether in the five months of their first discussion, Rohini confirmed that things happen slowly to the rolls:</seg>
<seg id="1532">So far we have made little steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tested it a few times, but then they listened to say their husband's name.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including me, make it still, but only when they are alone and no other family members.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two will continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now wear Zinnoberred on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in discussion will know that the changes that they want to achieve in their lives - like the fencing around more freedom of movement or their own closets - at the end of a hard to navigate the river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self-confidence, they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each one of us is a victim of Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am also there.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives everyone of us confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction if every woman goes home and told other people about what we are talking about and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We are all sitting in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1628">The following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of imprisoned Chinese dissidents Liu Xiaobo has drawn attention to the international community, after his lawyer had been announced at the end of June that he has been hospitalized due to liver cancers in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009, Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison for "Subversion" (sovereign debt), after having responded to the design of the Charter 08, a manifesto that claims the democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"" "the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China has referred to Lius case as" "" "an internal thing" "" "and a speaker tells, he said it" "" "not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1633">Yet China is still receiving calls from the international community to allow Nobel laureate and his wife, poets of Liu Xia, or allow him to permit treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries have criticised the strict treatment of Paares in Beijing, others are completely exhausted.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has summed up some reactions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United Nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, met at the end of June Chinese civil servants to discuss the case of Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1638">However, a speaker refused to comment whether the United Nations should exert pressure to enable Liu in foreign countries.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's prime minister in Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister Børge Brende have refused to answer questions about Lius release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway came to Stocks after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu in 2010, although the Norwegian government announced that it ultimately decided nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">The diplomatic relations were continued until December last year. only in June, Norway signed an agreement to resume the salmon trip to China, as the exports had been mostly blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After the message has spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel committee was hoping for an unconditional release to the expression and invited Liu to get his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Due to his arrest, he was unable to gain his price.</seg>
<seg id="1645">Liu was represented by an empty chair during the ceremony.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">On 6 July, the European Parliament adopted a resolution on which China was asked to deliver Liu and his wife immediately from house arrest and allow him to seek emergency medical support, where he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The leading diplomat of the EU, Federica Mogherini, also called for the release of Lius for the release of Lius in a statement on 30 June:</seg>
<seg id="1649">At the same time, we expect China to raise all constraints of Mr Lius wife as well as family members.</seg>
<seg id="1650">They should meet and receive all visits you want, and be able to communicate freely with the outside world.</seg>
<seg id="1651">United States</seg>

<seg id="1661">The Chinese President Xi Jinping appeared on the G20 summit in Hamburg on 7 and 8 July.</seg>
<seg id="1662">Previously, diplomatic sources reported in Beijing of the news agency Reuters that China had big concerns whether the vortex could allow Liu's visit to Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1663">Canada</seg>
<seg id="1664">On 28 June, the Canadian ambassador John McCallum China called on to provide Liu an adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to let him take care of his family.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Lius attorney told AFP before that Lius woman, Liu Xia could visit him every day, but the police always monitors the room in the hospital and that it is not allowed to speak with anyone outside, including his lawyers to speak and contact.</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum continues:</seg>
<seg id="1667">Canada calls for China to uphold his international human rights obligations, including freedom of expression, and for the exercise of these rights.</seg>
<seg id="1668">France</seg>
<seg id="1669">The French Ministry of Foreign Affairs urged China to release Liu from humanitarian reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1670">All necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xiaobo receives all the treatments that he needs, regardless of where needed. furthermore, his wife and his family have been in contact with him.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that France will not give any further information if France would ultimately absorb it.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Taiwan</seg>
<seg id="1673">"" "" "" "the Council of commemorative affairs in Taiwan called on June 27 to release Liu and demand a major tolerance towards those who want to use peaceful funds to demand political reforms and democratic development." ""</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Taiwanese legislator Yu Mei-nu also challenged China to allow intellectually intellectual Liu to be treated in Taiwan.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Dalai Lama</seg>
<seg id="1676">The spiritual leader in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, showed herself on June 28 at Liu very worried and gave that many have asked him to pray for Lius well being.</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">"" "" "" "it is my belief that he took and for whom he had been strictly punished to a harmonic, more stable and wealthy China, which would have contributed to a more peaceful world." ""</seg>
<seg id="1679">I felt personally moved and encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, the Charter 08 signed, destined for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China.</seg>
<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1681">Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Licence: CC0 Domaine Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may appear dumb, since Singapore is recognized as an independent state as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be considered as a town.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the State Bar in New York, the Minister, that many people criticised the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared to Singapore in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supported that Singapore should be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... No one has questioned whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">That is, most people go a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we might be different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"" "the blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice to" "" "turn the logic" "" "to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore." ""</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and sacrificed to create this valuable country, one hears that we ultimately could not be a country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of an escape before the responsibilities, a breach of duty.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, whose country is it?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons made by Shanmugam were not very nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', in view of his, he appeared ininevitably undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">On the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities that become permanent from a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratically.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Once you reach the core point of the subject, the good old corer appears from the authoritarian rulers, which pretend democrates, leaving the twisted logic, as it fits better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the end of this week, the last week of Shanmugam gave answers to his American guests regarding our press, our dicate, our political system really non-answers.</seg>
<seg id="1703">According to relevant questions, it tarts with non-responses irrational styles.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls for Shanmugam to illustrate his mind, since they did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Personally, I find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country, but a city is, so far our city belongs...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I don't understand anything.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our dear K Shanmugam would take the effort to clarify this point, if it was highly paid to be part of the government of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By announcing on the blog, he has published his comment on the critics to start reading the complete co-ordinance of the conference, so that you can understand the context of the statements of Shanmugam better, according to which Singapore was a city and no country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"" "when he said that Singapore was rather a" "" "city" "" "as a country," "" "he explained why the elections in Singapore be so unimportant, even if we are looking forward to free and just choices." ""</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared to Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities witnessed a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "when he said, Singapore" "" "is no country," "" "he obviously did not mean it in this sense!" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment via Shanmugam, who as the leader of a growing generation, makes such a polemic statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said very much...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old Garde that I expect - do I agree with them or not, but that's another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, member of the new generation of the political leader of Singapore I have doubts and I'm not even sure if he really believes that he really believes and aware of what he is defended.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review dismounts the weaknesses of Shanmugams Arganda:</seg>
<seg id="1719">Does Mr Shanmugam "committed a mistake" or was it a free speaker?</seg>
<seg id="1720">When Singapore is not a country, we are considered as an independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, on which country go back the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is equally country and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">As he plays an important role within the government office, the statements of Mr. Shanmugam are of severe importance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why do the Singapurers afford their military service, but do they only defend their city?</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who must pay back our prime minister?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink personnel?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we citizens of a country, or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">In addition, the magazine Journey of a Decade on affirmation to Singapore is always a town:</seg>
<seg id="1729">"I did not say what I said..."</seg>
<seg id="1730">This sentence seems to have been annoyed by a lot of Singapore...</seg>
<seg id="1731">No one has ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We have always been a city / island nation.</seg>
<seg id="1734">"" "I can understand that we often hear statements like" "" "the defense of the country above all," "" "but that is not quite true." ""</seg>

<seg id="1898">On the way of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tapachula, located on the border with Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is led by a 59- year-old Mexican writer, a small woman with a corallish pink flameco chassis and golden earrings in teddy bear.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called Concepción González Ramírez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless they know many under the name Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a target for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about 2,50 dollars the night sleep the guests in simple rooms, with bare, brittle walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">There is a parrots in a cage in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - still hundreds of African immigrants come here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, Mrs. Ramírez told the people in full minibuses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to call: "Mama Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you with Mama Africa? "</seg>
<seg id="1910">Currently it's more quiet but this year Ramírez has already received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have slept outside on boxes outside.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She doesn't want to reject anybody.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick, she buys them medication that they cannot pay them, they massaged them with a balm that exhausts off the long voyage.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, arrived at a short time ago.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him whether Mama Africa was a reasonable nickname for Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>

<seg id="1919">"" "" "" "yes, yes," "" "he replies with a smile." "" "I really feel that it suits her because African women are very nice women." ""</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very loving.</seg>

<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister she hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and her three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">They already lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on the way to the United States to take a first stop in South America and then move north.</seg>
<seg id="1925">"" "the family had heard from other pioneers in Mom Africa." "" "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track," "" "says Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti." ""</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells us that Haitians and Africans often travel along the route and that Africans have already speaking to WhatsApp by Ms. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">As many of his companion, Michelet lived in Brazil in advance and worked as a construction worker for the Olympic Games and the FIFA World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy has been weaker, he started his journey into the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months. he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the Busticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will contact Ms. Ramírez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"" "" "" "Mama Africa is our mother and we never let them go again," "" "he is smiling." "" "we will always remain in touch." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1932">Mrs. Ramírez told that their guests have often send text messages when they are gone to grate them or to report about the course of their journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She doesn't know much about Africa but her guests have taught them to prepare chicken as in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Mrs. Ramírez is perhaps very well known here, but it is not the only spark of hope for migrants who are travelling through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jesús Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">This winter, Valenzuela and his family have recorded migrants in their little house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">It is a policeman and has found that the Bustickets are sold to numerous African immigrants.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He started to help them to get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for a dollar spent the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment, there are 25 people, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on the ground, but at least they have electricity, washing machine and a kitchen outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests can do.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I lived in the United States," he told. "I experienced what they are experiencing.</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border crossing the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others do not help. that's why I give them my support. "</seg>
<seg id="1946">After he lived for three years, he was deported to a raid on his office from the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants who travels through Tapachula comes from Central America, other inhabitants also open the doors of their houses for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to make money from him, without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula he asked for a housing and an unfamiliar, single-minded, offered to him their roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later the family lives still there and she tries to decide where the next steps should go.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa everything is again full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the courses, the travellers consult their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus arrived today and has brought 20 new guests, most of Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Mrs. Ramírez seems happy that her house is full, but she is nostalgic, because of those who have gone away.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother, she leaflets her album in her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There are one of her daughter with African hair spots that you made a client, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, kids and old.</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs, while she imagines her.</seg>

<seg id="1961">The inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minorities region in the West of China, are forced to install a spyware on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On 10 July, the mobile user in the Tianshan district of the city of Urumqi was given a mobile notification, where they found the District Government to install a monitoring app named Jingwang (or "Web Cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "in the message, the app" "" "The app" "" "should get access to terrorist information." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">However, the authorities used to use the app for more than fight against terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report of Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh Prefecture, because they had installed the app shortly after they had been replaced with a private chat group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">"" "in the communication of the police, the app would determine the sources and the distribution channels of terrorists" "" "contradictions" "" "together with" "" "illegal religious" "" "activities and" "" "harmful information" "" "including videos, images, eBooks and documents."

<seg id="1967">Jingwangs website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is blocking pornographic web pages, of online fraud, trojans and phishing pages to make users attentive to how much time they spend online, and to remotely control their own home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app, with the filters for minors, aims to help the children to develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can of course be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote control" or even hackers capable of manipulating a person's home network or steal it.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While news about digital censorship in China mostly focus on the experience of users in the larger cities in the east and south, the reality is often very dark for those who live in distant ethnic minority regions like Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">To limit disturbances and dissatisfaction in conflict areas, authorities often arrange extreme censors and security measures as well as routinely Internet interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1976">The media-based media Outlet "Images from the China" (standardized in China), the censored news published in China, showed photos from a Checkpoint where the residents were selectable if they had installed the surveillance app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian make sure the people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification requested that people install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are discovered at a Checkpoint with a device without these software, they may be imprisoned for up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The Jordanian Rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of LGBTQ + community, free expression of expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib recovers the majority of his time inside; sometimes he sitteth to his screen, to his computer, and again to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">What you can rely on is a cigarette between his fingers or his nicotine bordered lips to discover.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He died in the top of his family house which had belonged to them since 1967; the year, in which Israel had completed its occupation of the West Bank, and Hdaibs family had forced to flee from their village in Palestine, where they had lived as felahyees (about: Farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years, Hdaib has been a passionate activist that was transferred to the conservative majority and left their old proven opinions on sex roles, sexuality and free expression of expression through art and rapture.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music they often deal with topics such as Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian gewinged, but also calls for the core of the entire Arab world, but also in cities that from Damascus to reach Sanaa within Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With its 25 years, Hdaib sees himself as a man who is not restricted by limits to his mind, and he can feel according to their own statement by people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign intervention in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even though he does not give it open, he puts a special tense against US foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib looked at his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe that his sympathy for those who try to do in war zones, must do anything with his identity as "Palestinian gearing of the second generation" - so he himself was born in Jordan and never before Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think of my own living conditions so," emphasizes Hdaib.</seg>
<seg id="2104">"" "then he adds:" "" "I think I'm a person, while he pour into two cups. it is the holy month Ramadan, in this time it is intended for Muslims to fast sunset from sunrise to sunset." ""</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also says that the public consumption of food is illegal during Ramadan.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously Hdaib has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee at a sening hot young Congress has little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically the smug swept the coffee and the swaths of the Kent cigar in the nose into the first line of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open air, especially when you throw a look into the neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">It is simply avoidable to do basic things - as in the public during Ramadan water - to land not to land in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, the Interior Ministry of Jordan took part in the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some parliamentarians support the Muslim Brotherhood - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argue that the sexual orientation of the homosexual incts, Hamed Sinno, contradict the cultural and traditional norms of the country, and the main reason for the concert hall.</seg>
<seg id="2112">"" "in an interview with CNN, the Socialist Coalition Dima Tahboub said that the concert" "" "just" "" "had been cancelled because of the sexual orientation of the scans." ""</seg>
<seg id="2113">"" "" "" "many also claim the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, Human Rights and free speech of expression in the Arab world is more dangerous activism that inquire the old legitimacy of authoritarian regimes in the entire region." ""</seg>
<seg id="2114">"" "in a public statement, Mashrou'Leila appreciated the Jordanian people as" "" "progressive supporters of human rights" "" "who continues to stand for an intellectual and cultural pluralism." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement is probably not just the rhetoric of rhetoric, but actually a more evident reality reflected in Jordan, which emerges in Hdaibs's work.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib created traditional gender norms to body, formed by his vision of the fate of Arabic women who did not have sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of a clearly drunk unidentified woman whose arms and legs stretch out to the corners of the canvas.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those who should actually trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Over the past years, Jordan has increased the number of 'honourable moral' - the unofficial outside.</seg>
<seg id="2120">According to Human Rights Watch, the number of Honour in 2016 reached its culmination in 2016; however, the institutional infrastructure is missing to support women who attempted to support the victims of murder or domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2121">"" "according to a law on the fragile loss of the year 1954, women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence," "" "and for her release, often a years of bureaucratic effort and the guarantee on the family is necessary that the woman will not happen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2122">Also Hdaibs music is a great popularity and is known for it, also not shy away from themes that have long been taboo in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib deny that his work is politically, however, that he is his music that is full of explicit announcements on sexuality, freedom and expression of expression.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the food, man.</seg>
<seg id="2125">He was installer on me, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called 'Edward Sa'ed, Hdaib takes the question of the Palestinian identity.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"" "in" "" "Lawla al 3aib" "" "and in" "" "Ghareeb" "" "lies the focus again on poverty." ""</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are politically active in the core, can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016, Hdaib released a song titled "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse repeated itself often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and every other is it."</seg>
<seg id="2132">In further course of the song, Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market, on which one can get in his words, "that can get what you want" - be Faith or Nonsense, Hetero- or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notices that there are hardly anyone in Jordan on the rights of gay and readers, and that comments on equality of LGBTQ + individuals are still heavily censored by 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular jordan OnlineProgram Roya to remember that his comments were torn out of the context, twisted and censored in his view.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube, it was uploaded without cuts, but it was only a revised version," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib advertises the Arab LGBTQ + community and represent the opinion that intolerance against homosexuals do not speak of Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nuwhat, a poet of the eighth century, who still has remained in memory thanks to his homoerotic poetry.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks itself: if Abu Nuwhat was supposed to work once again on behalf of the Caliph, in eighth century openly about homosexuality, why can Jordanier not know that?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, I have nothing to do with Mashrou 'Leila or the fact that the concert was canceled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">"" "" "" "in the hashemian kingdom there is nothing new that the government announced the attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are being put to silence." ""</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian news service announced several former government officials and members of the textbook that were criticized with the problems in social media, which were united with the deeply rooted corruption in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of this, the Hdaibs concert is only the tip of the iceberg - the actual challenge is to make structural changes in the next generation of the Jordanians.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him, progress is a constant giving and taking. Jordan has denied a appearance for the second time in a row, but the way of progress - so it looks like a slow, bedside and internal changes. it is certain that these changes will take place daily in the heart of the Jordanian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Ultimately, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, also dreamt of an Arab world without interventions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">"" "he is not only dreaming of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also of it" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region is thinking about music, art and literature of a true and basic openness - and not by bombs, streetunitions, and on artificial kind. at least he hopes it.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until it is ready, Hdaib will continue to rap and thus afford resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2148">This report was made by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, which Aman belong as a student Fellow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the 3 largest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">These big, extravagant war puppen are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Nebuta festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">It is thought that there is a variation of the Tanabata festival that is usually also celebrated in many areas of Tohokus. another theory suggests that the wagons, the drums and dancing were taken over a thousand years, in order to force the indigenous people of the region to force the indigenous people of the region, the Emishi, to force the knee.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We could catch a few great seats, so we have a great view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">You can only imagine how big these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A joint centre in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, organized a two-month exhibition at Wa no Akari (literal).</seg>
<seg id="2157">I've been watching the Meguro Gajoen again for a long time: there are two wagons just to see.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nevertheless, for many people who take the journey to Aomori, the Nebuta festival will take the only way to spend his summer:</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>
<seg id="2160">Yattemare! "# Summer Festival in the North of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2161">I was there and watched the # NebutaFestival.</seg>
<seg id="2162">The sight of a 18 metres high tower was amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2163">Let's enjoy the rest of the summer!</seg>

<seg id="2168">El Callao, Perus's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, near the historic center of the capital Lima, a region with a very high crime rate, where street robbery and illegal drug trafficking are daily.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region do not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">In the same time Peru - like many other middle and South American countries - rising demand for aesthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, appearance and also the unusual hairstyles by famous athletes such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Peru), has led to become more normality in the experienced hands of hairdressers, which can recreate these awful hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairstyles, which go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity, has even inspired an annual event, the competition of hairdresser "Batalla de Barberos," which has been taking place since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">There are experts in each other to show who can create the most uncentralized Looks you can see in the following video (other videos on current competitions there are on public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions such as the school Augusto Salazar Bondy, who found themselves in El Callao, found here an opportunity to persuade young people to find their weapons against hairdressing tools and to obtain training in hair art, which allows them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and the opportunity, dozens of teenagers have seen that they can take a job, which is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">The school year before the school year announced special training workshops and reported some of their successes:</seg>

<seg id="2181">"" "the following article is the revised version of the" "" "love botanical" "", "which has published the international online magazine Tea After Twelve." ""</seg>
<seg id="2182">The entry will be published here in a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people who we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not yet much more important, people who are ejected to offer affection?</seg>
<seg id="2185">This question was exactly this question the two young colony activists Leonardo Párraga from the Foundation BogotArt and Cristian Palacios from the Young Youth Foundation and inspired her to write letters to the campaign cartas por la Reconciliación (letters for Reconciliation), the young people encouraged to write guerrilla fighters letters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Only recently, its land was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute to their part: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government had signed a peace agreement with the Guerillamovement FARC (German: revolutionary armed forces), which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">"" "" "" "International applied to the peace agreement as so significant that the Colombian president Jose Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his services." ""</seg>
<seg id="2188">"" "" "" "however, in front of the columns there is still a long way to speak from a real propitiation and peace." ""</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrillakkluft, who lived for many years in illegal camps, were exposed to a war rhetoric, and around the clock had carried their weapons at themselves and now have to integrate into life as civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">"" "" "" "the Colombian society, again, who had become accustomed to life in some cases and in some cases, must now record their ranks and support them in the construction of a new life." ""</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young columbians would close together and help with the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's exactly what they did: until now, thousands of young people have written letters - love botanings to former guerrilla fighters in order to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The goal of the campaign are 6900 letters - one for each former guerrilla, which should then be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the letter to reconciliation was held at the World Summit of the Nobel Peace Laureate who took place in Bogotá. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to speak shortly with Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">"" "this stated that we love the people who love to write thousands of love letters, but those who need them need much unnecessary." ""</seg>
<seg id="2197">He plane, he told him to share his love with people this year, who needed most urgent issues.</seg>
<seg id="2198">"" "so the plan arose, letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC." "" "the letters will show that Colombian society is ready to make a discourse from a war history to a common history of peace," "" "they say." ""</seg>
<seg id="2199">More than 2000 letters were collected during the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'i never thought that someone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over on March 19 in one of the UN camps in the Caldono-Cauca region.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the Municipality of Cali and Leonardo from the Foundation BogotArt traveled into the camp to bring the letters personal.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC presented themselves as they had done earlier in order to oppose the commands of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they didn't receive commands, but letters full of subprotected people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for all involved. "it's unbelievable how many different feelings can walk through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that lies in between," explains the politician Manuela Jiménez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, an employee of the Governor of the province of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After crossing the letters, a former fighter led me through the camp of guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">"" "when I saw in one of the" "" "Cambook" "" "(a kind of hut, where the guerrilla life) saw, I saw a guerrilla, who wrote something." ""</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go down, as beside him on the bed was a MGL grenade, a deadly weapon in the bush.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "but I spoke to him and said," "" "Hello, what are they doing?" "" "he said," "" "I am answering a letter which someone wrote to me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"" "never in my life someone has written something like this, that's why I answer it." "" "suddenly the tears ran through the cheeks." ""</seg>
<seg id="2214">I embraced him completely, and put me beside the pomegranates.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Maybe he was sorry for the war, I was sorry to be all those years of the faithful companions of this battle, and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he had never expected something else from life. the FARC had never been expecting him to preserve him and his six brothers before the Hungertod. "I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistake.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a company outside, waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now, I only learned how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">But now where peace is prevailing, I can learn many things and work in dignity. "</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">For the prelude, students and some leaders of the FARC came together to a discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as a war and the FARC was already in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">Therefore, the leaders of the FARC declared the history of the organisation, its ideals and gave insight into their views on the whole Colombian people. now, where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party, we can help to develop the society in this country.</seg>
<seg id="2224">"" "the aim of this magnitude is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles," "" "said one of them." ""</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">Those people who had never heard that previously had never heard and had no electoral law, and even learned to know that people who were often shot as monsters and even hate, even people with beautiful feelings and their environment was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality where the country lives, doesn't hurt me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforts me that all men - even those who have killed and so much harm can be taught us and give us a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo González, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example Darío de Jesús Monsalve, archbishop of the city of Cali, the following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">Columbianists was prophesied that peace would prevail after disarmament peace.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as it is inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are ready to rise to the weapons and to protest their rights and that is completely justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">We from the FARC now rely on peace, on a policy without weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call all defenders of peace - no matter what race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those that dream of a country in the war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, make our contribution, and give sacrifices, for we know of their own experience that nothing is simple. the one among us who defend life as the basis of existence will be minent.</seg>
<seg id="2237">On our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2271">In the hospital, I learned that I had two sampling in my right lung wings.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: which wings have you laid out - in which the men or the women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are outdated, there is still my male name; but the doctor stood and put me to the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very grateful to him.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time at his office door, I was afraid to do it with fear; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good person.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him that he is respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than one month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February, I got threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote me - relatives, stranger, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbours and some remote relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The requested, send me back to Chechnya to prove that all that was a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They asked absurd claims: some say to me, I must prove it off by streets; others wanted that I had not changed in the official television in Grosny, and I say that I had not changed my sex, that everything was just bad talk, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have grain size C - what should I have to say on television?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how has your family tried to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still difficult for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some older people once said my mother on the road.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"" "they said to her," "" "You have brought a monster to the world, not only your family, but the entire republic was ashamed." ""</seg>
<seg id="2290">"" "we can't touch you, because you are a pious woman, but you must vanish from here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother got too much and she got a rope around the neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily the neighbors and saved them came.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At the time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to an apartment and a few hours later there was a car with darkened window plates and a number plate with a 95.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After the third time happened, I realized that there was a bit lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights friends checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how are you fled?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For safety reasons, I don't want to give their names but I want to remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With their help I left the country, but then something terrible happened.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother once I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought them, without registration, without ID, without everything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw it in the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked in the hotel.</seg>

<seg id="2311">Can you imagine this?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">That was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: do you still stand in touch with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">However, we don't talk about the gender equality, but this is a taboo subject.</seg>
<seg id="2316">I still carry some traditional Caucasian items in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">So much I wish I can't overcome this seelian barrier.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to hurt them.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chat with camera, I really give trouble to look like the person to look at them from their past - so to my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know anything about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What are your friends, those who are dortable?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">I needed more information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I spoke to somebody who had one and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told that during Ramadan, he was arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan were barely able to wait, and he did not lock a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will focus on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">"" "so that my I, they probably invite their relatives, these take care of the problem with the affected person, and at the end demand a proof that the so-called" "" "honor" "" "experience by blood." ""</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are now even gay men arrested in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of me says it would not be very many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, then especially those who have no rich relatives or were left behind their relatives to place Kadyrows's court.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they are detained there so that they can present yourself later as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">"" "say," "" "Should they be killed, they will show their bodies on television and claim they have attacked any village or a military base." ""</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people were not simply vanished, but dipped specifically to radicalise herself.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is that now just a mistake or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was imprisoned in Argun for a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people had disappeared in this prison after their beard had grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There have been nothing new of them since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They just took them.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, this person was, as these people were taken away.</seg>
<seg id="2342">However, until now, they were not introduced as bandits, so far there were no reports about it. however, we suspect such actions are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why would it not be allowed to shave these people?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know if these persecutions and kidnappings of people who belong to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation have already occurred in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I've been wearing my hair always long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya, I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think that before 2003, I was already well known in Great Britain, when I was still living there - and I never had problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">Ernst! in Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999 when the Sharia was considered, I never had problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, it was much safer than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">"" "Russia originally wanted to lead us to" "" "civil war" "", "but finally threw us back to the stoneage." ""</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were gripped; I had colored eyelashes, bore tube jeans and short tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Ministry of Security of Sharia has never touched me a hair too.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Before the Russian theater in Grosny there was a place where every night, especially at weekends, a whole group of people met me.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several benches stood, and the whole city knew it; they knew why men, young people, met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been insulted.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a Redemple: Kharda ma Kharda. that means: "Scotsman is not about misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">You often say it to children when they make sick of sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they just have their eyes closed before you because they believed they are sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never insulted me, never hunted and never defeated.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this willow cost?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrow came to the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began to talk about morals on television.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He did not talk about us, but primarily about the behaviour of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - you could feel how people started to change in the city.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Those who had suffered and laughed at once, did not see you with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">At the time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I got back home, I could feel how the situation in the republic gets worse.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you go now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I do not earn much - $700 to 800 dollars per month in the US.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that, I'm still working as an activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently, I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organize teetreffs, mergers, I join them to the hospital and help them to get food types.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't have a penny for it.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I have discovered these people, when I conceive of breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslims and want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear an Hidschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that's alable.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So is nature, that has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This is exactly the same as Chechens who prophesying with foam in front of the mouth, that there are no spools in them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Dagestans have which the Cabardiner have, the Russians have known what they have; on the whole planet they exist - but "not in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2386">I'm from there, that's why it is unpleasant for me to hear.</seg>
<seg id="2387">Here I meet so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and during Ramadan - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">You know, many think of transidentity to men who love men and believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a turbulent.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different ways of feeling to be precise, different life settings.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel me in my own skin and not to be ashamed for my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not if I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Sorry I'm so personal, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I am not sad at all - I simply don't know that I'm myself.</seg>

<seg id="2412">A century ago, the Arab Ahraz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran, until the Pahlavi monarchy assumed power and had taken great effort in 1925 to stop ethnic autonomy all over Iran.</seg>

<seg id="2487">If women ask at all once, they generally do not get support from the state.</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, with his agreement</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is only rare or not mentioned in the media. thus, it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">For the need on-site medical research there are two reasons: for a lack in the offer of global health system, many medicines and vaccines decided to cover the special healthcare needs on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have become far more serious in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere, and lacking investment in exploring these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a big problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Secondly, research, which is conducted by African scientists, helps build up their own research capacities in Africa. a major role in science and technology can only be eligible for the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is Director of the Center for Infectious diseases in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew up in the 1990s in Lusaka, Zambia, just as the AIDS epidemic had shown the first serious impact on national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for studying in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Pennsylvania, he researched himself on HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the samic health system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about misunderstandings of the media about these research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(Disclaimer: Dr. Warrier speaks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research theme?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment, the focus is on my work on the application of research. thereby I support the samic national programme for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">In addition, I just launch a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB, and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">GV: what are your opinion of the important current scientific themes in your country and general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there are no basic research here. we only employ solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This must change, otherwise we will always remain receivers, rather than to be movers.</seg>

<seg id="2608">How simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>

<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who come back or hither, because the financing and development opportunities are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">GV: what is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What obstacles are there in your routine research work which you did not have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: basic infrastructure does not comply with standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money, a continuous supply of electricity, water and Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory material is expensive, and it takes months to import them from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">GV: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there are already interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods were taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">GV: how big is your opinion the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should they concentrate? how can we support the development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There are needs of special academic training, starting at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer science, big data, research of space, health care (non-transferable and infectious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will greatly benefit.</seg>
<seg id="2624">GV: can you describe the pros and cons of life as a scientist in Africa opposite Western countries, based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: many times are the limited speed, things to do, and the easy access to scientific expertise, which represent challenges ahead.</seg>

<seg id="2628">This article by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the Ensia.com website, a magazine which focuses on solutions for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been brewed in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company offers 114 species, such as outredded, the first plant which has been cultivated and consumed by NASA astronauts in space.</seg>
<seg id="2631">Almost 20 years, Morton's work has been made only through his own ingenuity and the question how many salads can get limits.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000s he noticed that there were ever more salads patented, and that he could not use them for breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents are not only for individual varieties, but also for certain traits such as resistance to diseases, a special rotor or green or cluttered leafs.</seg>
<seg id="2634">In recent years more such patents have been applied to more plants such as cereal or cartoons. due to these trends, plant breeding and expert food security concerns the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate member of a millennia of ancient tradition, Morton is still burdened with salad, but it needs longer, because his work is still impacted by more restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "it is, as if there would be a rock of boulders, around which I have to be called." ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">"" "so we have to do that now, but it's a breach with the breeding tradition," "" "He says." "" "I think these patents are going too far." ""</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if they stand before court, no one can breed a new salad, because all features are already patented. "he's so good as possible and tries to breed those features, which he wants.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, he is very careful and tries to use no material that is protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">It has also been connected to a movement that is growing in the USA and everywhere in the world: open source Breeding ("Open Source" breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have eaten red tubes of the sort outredded in the "greenhouse" plant and eaten. there we tested whether plants can be grown in space.</seg>

<seg id="2645">"" "" "" "it was established in order to ensure that some plant species and gene are not protected as intellectual property and can be used permanently for plant breeders." ""</seg>
<seg id="2646">As part of the initiative, called Ossi, US breeders can also undertake that others can use some of them bred seed-free.</seg>
<seg id="2647">"" "however, this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it." "" "open source" "" "breeders allow her seed to breed it, and it is not immediately removable - two aspects that are prohibited or prescribed by many plant patrons." ""</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Dismal prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">For emeritus Professor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi-member of the board Jack Kloppenburg are control over seed and the possibility of breeding new plants, both important for food security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Seeds plays a role in larger formations such as biodiversity, rights of peasants, control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter or only little to use natural resistance to natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg emphasises that the "open source" movement does not work with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">"" "" "" "all kinds of plants could be patented if vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not," "" "who wants to get control over the seed," "" "he says, and takes care of the increasingly common mergers in the global agricultural industry," "" "he who wants to buy food markets in August and September 2016, should also know that the way is bred on how this vegetables are farmed." ""</seg>
<seg id="2654">"" "nutrition sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative are committed to others to provide seed more freely. in contrast, their prejudices are to be patented with seed and plant features.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is endangered because of the most numerous intellectual property rights to plant material, which thus is always restricted, incessantly to shrink.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, Executive Director of Ossi, worked in her thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found out that roughly one-third of all cases of cartoots is protected as intellectual property, which means that it can either be used for plant breeders either.</seg>
<seg id="2659">For other plants, there are not such estimates yet, but experts like Luby suspect that massaged plants like wheat in even bigger style are patented as a salad or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are so bred that they have targeted special features - of such, through which their taste or colour improves up to such, because of them flourish in certain environments, such as pests and illnesses.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Adversaries of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing by increasingly more patents. however, genetic diversity is currently more necessary than ever since the changed conditions are much worse before climate change.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail Monsanto's spokeswoman Carly Scaduto acknowledges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsanto's activities. with a total of four banks and the cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States, the company set up the preservation of genetic variety.</seg>
<seg id="2664">"" "however, it does not contradict that other breeders of other breeders" "" "promote" "" "patents and protection of plant variance systems." "" "a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow, as soon as the patent has expired." ""</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often they help others to come with another method to come to the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Such a protection does not inhibits innovations, but promotes the public and know more material and know-how. "</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton sees the other way: 20 years to wait until a patent is composed, that certainly does not support any innovations.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you are waiting for so long to breed in plants, which have been adapted to the modified environmental conditions, one would have lost the fight.</seg>
<seg id="2669">However, the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources should have been a general well and remain there: "independent plant breeders have neither the time nor money for such formalities, and monetular incentives are not attractive to us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want to make farmers easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"" "this is what drives us, and it will be impossible if we cannot continue to use the best and latest genetic resources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2672">In total, Morton is disturbed on the concept to patented plant features: "we do not create the characteristics itself.</seg>
<seg id="2673">They form the plants themselves, and as breeders, we have no idea how the plants do this.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeding in the US state Oregon and Ossi board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "those who breeds a variety, also chastens its own values in it.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, in which cultivation approaches Herbicide, breeding into his varieties of this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is closely gentile. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized companies (such that move on international markets, but smaller than e.g. Monsanto s) patents have to survive the most smaller seed companies, either to survive it or hold it for expensive and therefore not rewarding or both is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeders Frank Morton is looking for salads in its breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton is also the view that breeders would be innovative by avoiding the plant patentative: "it looks like me to produce new efforts to produce new, stronger than companies.</seg>
<seg id="2682">"" "I need constantly new material for my catalogue, as I know my competitors are selling my varieties in a couple of years," "" "he says." "" "with a patent it is protected for 20 years before competition, with which it is quite simple." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2687">(regulations for breeding differ from country to country, because the Ossi commitment does not simply become one of one in Europe or other parts of the world.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">At the beginning of November 2016, the executive branch of the European Union, the European Commission, declares that conventionally bred plants should not be patented. thus, it speaks against the current practice of the European Patent Office, the patents on conventionally bred plants.</seg>

<seg id="2721">Still, the Egyptian authorities still lock content on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a columnists.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend of the 05.August, the Egyptian government closed the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights violations in Egypt as well as the Arab world.</seg>

"" "if it has never been so difficult to pursue these goals in this part of the world, it was never as important as now. ANHRI thus has never been so important to overcome this targets and not follow it." "" "we insist on it to continue our task." ""</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered as the first censored web site of a human rights organisation in Egypt, after the authorities blocked the independent news page MADA Masr, arabic-language edition of Huffington Post and the Al Jazeera network of Al Jazeera because of alleged "support of terrorism."</seg>

<seg id="2728">Besides the ANHRI, there is no access to the blog of the columnists and Human Rights Studies, Ahmed Gamal Ziada.</seg>

<seg id="2731">Blogger, the vendor, too, is home to Ziadas blog, however, is further accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photo journalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity, after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces during December 2013, while he recorded a video about the students' protests and recorded a video like the police trained physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles mainly turn around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment, Ziada commented on the blocking through the government and reflected what it means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">Those who block blogs is very old, however, in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi priority; and even if the blocking of the blogs may not be significant for the world, it is for me for two reasons:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It's been successful to give me the feeling of an siege system; an arrest, a successively murder, unloading of the national Security Council, the blocking blogs and any other website for which I worked.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You have proved that I did not write for nothing. in other words, my words have influence, if only on a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First, I used it to the post of articles to bypass the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">But now, after they have closed it, and have fear of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The mugs go the way up to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (AFTE), Egyptian authorities closed from 24 May to 06 August 133 websites. this resulted technical tests on the networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etisalate.</seg>
<seg id="2743">AFTE also documented the blocking of providers by creating internet search and private surfing possible, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">AFTE reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12 we noticed how the blocking of Web pages that VPNs began to offer.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such practice suggests the intention of the Government to continue to block content and filter to filter the Egyptian users.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"" "" "" "the situation will also be worsened that the censored decisions are taken behind closed doors, whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis by which they can proceed against this actions." ""</seg>

<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>

<seg id="2759">Thus, published for the detailed reporting on violence in Rio well known newspaper "Extra" on August 16, the editorial "This is not normal," where they announced, a new category called "war in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports on violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The motives for their decision explained the newspaper so:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report about crime that will happen in any major city on the world like murder, robbery, sexualabrupt, etc. everything, however, is published in the heading "War in Rio." (...) This is our way to call: this is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">"" "" "" "this is the only alternative that we as journalists did not close our eyes before the cruelty." ""</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four-minute video that was shared on Facebook, Octávio Guedes said that this decision was not an occasion for pride, but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper on the whole world with a war rubrik in a country that didn't recognize the war.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist in the newspaper explains that according to the Institute of Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro 843 territories that are controlled by criminals organizations.</seg>

<seg id="2768">"" "" "" "we are aware that a war discourse, if it is distorted, will also be used to suspend cruelions of the police, who is only shooting and then ask questions." ""</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police, whose goal is not the civilian population, but the economic power of the Mafia and its partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the term "war" harm more than it?</seg>
<seg id="2771">"" "in an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, journalist Cecília Oliveira has argued the violence as" "" "war" "". "in their opinion, it was a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult to take charge of the police." ""</seg>

<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and worse planning - such as extra in the analysis of military interest rates in Rio itself - in combination with non-sufficient investment in staff, reconnaissance and historical and selfty neglect of public service.</seg>
