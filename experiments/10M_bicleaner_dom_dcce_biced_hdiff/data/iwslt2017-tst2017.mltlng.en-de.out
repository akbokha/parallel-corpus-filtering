this is James R@@ isen .
maybe you know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as New York Times rep@@ orter .
long before someone had heard of Edward Snow@@ den , R@@ isen wrote a book in which he spectac@@ ularly published that the NSA rep@@ or@@ tedly listened illegal tel@@ eph@@ ones of Americans .
but there is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
it describes a dis@@ astro@@ us US intelligence operation , which gave the CIA literally dra@@ fts for a nuclear bomb .
if that sounds crazy , read it .
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who did not like the chapter ?
the US government .
for almost 10 years the government has chosen R@@ isen and asked him to call his alleged sources .
in this turn , he became a symbol of the patterns of government , wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lower , and to spy journalists .
according to First Constitutional Complaints , the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right if media cannot get this information , and if they cannot protect identity of the Mu@@ amm@@ ers , which they will cost .
thus , when the government went on to R@@ isen , he did something that had told many cour@@ ageous rep@@ orters already before him , he refused , and he said that he would rather go to prison .
so from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen lived with the risk to go to prison .
but then , just days before the process , something extraordinary happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly , though they had been vital for their case , the claims of the government were dropped to R@@ isen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason : in the period of electronic monitoring , rep@@ orters and springs can always be conce@@ aled .
instead of failure and irrit@@ ation to get statements , that could also do its digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investig@@ ators , without having consent , calls himself secret his calls ,
just like his e @-@ mail data , financial and bank information , its credit card , and even travel documents with the list of its flights .
in the midst of these information , they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling , CIA @-@ W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower and cra@@ cks .
unfortunately , this is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower . but instead , justice has condemned more than all U.S. governments in front of him .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government is too much of their work as secret .
since September 11 , almost every article about national security was the result that a wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lower went to a journalist .
so we put the media on the game , which should be protected by the first const@@ itu@@ ency , because the government has more possibilities to exclu@@ de all .
but just as technology of the government allowed to handle the rights of rep@@ orters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources .
and indeed , they can do that from the moment , in which they contact , instead of desc@@ ending , in stuff .
today , it is a communication software that has not existed when R@@ isen had written his book , and it is much safer to call ordinary e @-@ mails or phone calls .
such a technology is a Secure@@ Drop , an open @-@ source transfer system for wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lower , which was originally developed by the website of Aaron S@@ wart@@ z , and is now published by the Freedom of the Press Foundation , where I have been working .
instead of send an e @-@ mail , go to a news website , just as the Washington Post works .
there you can upload documents or send information as with any common contact form .
these will then be encrypted and stored on a server , which only has access to the respective news agency .
so the government can no longer proc@@ ure information , and many of the information they would like to request would not be available from before@@ hand .
Secure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments develop new spy technologies around the world that end@@ anger us all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is possible to ensure that not only technology artists such as Edward Snow@@ den have a possibility to give ab@@ normal@@ ities . it is just as important that we protect the next wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lower . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trou@@ bles with the supply of soldiers compl@@ ained and wants to report by over@@ crowded hospitals . or the next environmental workers , the alarm to the contam@@ inated water of Flin@@ t . or a Wall@@ street @-@ Insider , who warned us before the next financial crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expos@@ e crimes , but to protect ourselves from all constitutional rights .
thank you .
&#91; on April 3 , 2016 , the largest data le@@ ck of history was published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; &#91; What does that mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness to be hidden . &#93; This week we were asked by news about a L@@ eck of 11 million documents of the Mos@@ sack Fon@@ se@@ ca
the publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers to companies such as Mos@@ sack Fon@@ se@@ ca and say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you setup it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we actually see emails , the exchange of messages , how the whole system works as it works .
this has already led to very direct consequences .
Islands Prime Minister has re@@ signed .
there are also reports that a ban of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad has v@@ oti@@ ves in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is claimed that a trace of 2 billion US dollars to Russia &apos;s President Vladimir Putin will lead to a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous Cel@@ lists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now there will be a lot of rich people and others who wait nervous for the next release , and on the next un@@ discovered documents .
this sounds like the plot of a agent modem or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham novel .
it seems , we@@ ep away from you , me , ordinary people .
why should we address this ?
but the truth is , if the rich and powerful in the position are to hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens , and do not pay all their taxes , then this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads .
and that concerns us all .
for my organisation , Global Wit@@ ness , these revel@@ ations are phenom@@ enal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the whole world , media and leading politicians , such as secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens are used by some few , to hide their assets and to send them -- something that we have been discuss@@ ing and un@@ veil . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think many people seem very conf@@ using this whole world , and it is hard to understand how this tax ha@@ v@@ ens function .
I always imagine it like a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ sel .
so you have a company in another company , in another company , what it is almost impossible to understand who is behind this building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be very difficult for prosecution and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what matters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think it is also interesting that there are fewer reports about this matter in the US .
probably because there was no known Americans that previously appeared in these revel@@ ations to this sc@@ andal .
now it is not that there are not enough Americans to hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
however , through the principle that this tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ se@@ ca has less American customers .
if we had a data le@@ ck of the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections in the USA .
in fact , it is so that in some U.S. states there is less information you need to start a company than to get a library card .
this type of in@@ transparent in the US has allowed them to cur@@ b school children .
it has been allowed to cur@@ b particularly vulner@@ able investors .
it is this kind of behavior that concerns us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a covered investig@@ ator into the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator gave himself as an African minister , who wanted to bring back money to the USA to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
we really shocked us that all except for a lawyer asked our investig@@ ator how he could transfer his money .
these were all pre@@ diction . none of these lawyers took us as a client , and of course no one was handed over to anyone else . but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important to consider this as a single fail@@ ures .
it &apos;s not about a individual lawyer , who has spread proposals for our hidden investig@@ ators .
it &apos;s not about a single top pole , involved in a sc@@ andal .
it is about how the system works through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability .
and to cope with this , we must change the rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to change the rules to make this sort of behavior difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this may sound very comfor@@ ting as if we could do anything against it , as if nothing had ever changed , as if there will always be the rich and powerful .
but as a born optim@@ ist , I see quite a lot has begun to change .
in the past few years , we have seen forward to more transparency , which concerns the owners of companies .
the theme found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
since then the EU has been cap@@ tures in central regist@@ ers at national level , who is really behind companies in Europe and who controls it .
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lag@@ ging behind .
representatives of both parties have inserted a bill in both parliamentary chambers , but this does not make progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see how these Panama &apos;s revel@@ ations , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , as a remedy is used to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need ordinary people who are fur@@ ious when others see how other people can hide their true identity behind the head@@ aches . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need exec@@ u@@ tives in the economy that rise up and say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ transparent is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians that recognize the problem and use it by law to stop this kind of in@@ transparent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
together we can finally stop the in@@ transparent , which is now possible to finish this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing .
this is the story , as I was almost kidn@@ apped and in the trunk of a red Maz@@ da would be .
one day after I finished my design studies , I made an ad@@ joining sale .
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stayed and looked up my bel@@ ong@@ ings .
he bought one of my works .
he was alone in the city and just made a road@@ trip through the whole country . afterwards he would go to the peace of peace .
I invited him to a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Where are you sleeping tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he made the whole thing worse : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I thought : &quot; Oh , man !
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to peace of peace , but I don &apos;t know if he really is planning it . I don &apos;t want to land away in the boot of a Maz@@ da !
this is a small boot !
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard myself : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How please ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at night I was in bed , I star@@ ed at the ceiling , and thought , &quot; Oh man ! what was I broken up ?
a wild living sleeping in my living room .
what if he is crazy ? &quot;
I got such a fear that I went out of the bed , at the toe of the door , and my sleep door shut down .
but he was not crazy .
we are still in touch with us .
the work of art that he bought from me is today in his classroom . he is now teachers .
this was my first experience as a host . it has completely changed my view@@ point .
maybe people who were sold in childhood as strangers , actually friends who were waiting to be discovered ?
people at my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mixture .
let &apos;s take a jump , two years later ...
I &apos;m jo@@ bless , almost ple@@ ite , pulling my room@@ mate and the rent will be increased .
I knew there was a design conference in the city at that time . all hotels were booked out .
I think creativity can make it be a lot of fun to transform .
I wrote my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I over@@ lay , how we could earn some time . our apartment is staying with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk , including a mattress and every morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and established so &quot; Ambi@@ mat@@ rat@@ ze and Breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep on wooden floor for 20 dollars .
they found it great , and we too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am sure our cheese ham O@@ mel@@ et tast@@ ed completely different because we made them for our guests . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we tou@@ red with them all over the city . when we passed our last guest and fell the door to the castle , Brian and I started .
had we just discovered that at the same time we find new friends and pay our rent ?
things came to rolls .
my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ ist , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find whether to make it a business concept .
we presented the investors : &quot; we want to create a website which includes people public pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their baths -- the kind of rooms whose doors are coming when visiting .
over the Internet , they can then invite wild people to stay with them .
that will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited for the miss@@ ile would ign@@ ite .
but they do not act .
no one , who is still quite consol@@ ation would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because we all learned as children , strangers are dangerous .
if you have a problem , you get on things that can be good . we could design it .
at the Academy of Fine Arts we learned that design is much more than just look and feel - it is the overall experience .
we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create an immense trust between people who had never met before .
can design be so special ?
is it possible to create confidence ?
I would like to give you a tasting , what degree we trust .
it is a 30 seconds experiment . it will force you out of your compilation .
thum@@ bs up if you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now , I &apos;d like to lock you out your mobile phone .
enter your locked mobile phone with your left seat .
this quiet approach of panic that you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts will feel when they open the door for the first time .
for the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , you can see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to keep the locked mobile phone of a stranger in your hands ?
most sense the responsibility .
that is how most guests feel when they stay elsewhere .
only for this reason our company can exist .
only times , who now has Al Go@@ res &apos;s cell phone ?
could you please tell us on Twitter that he is the president of the President ?
you can now return the mobile phones now .
you have experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I want to tell you about some discover@@ ies .
what if we have changed a little detail about this experiment ?
what if your neighbour had imagined only with its name , when he had told what he comes from , like his dog , or his children ?
imagine you would have 150 respon@@ dents , they all say : &quot; he can really hold very well locked phones ! &quot;
how would you feel when you had to return your mobile phone ?
because a well @-@ thought feedback system strength@@ ens confidence .
at the beginning we did some things wrong .
it was difficult for people to aband@@ on negative charges .
in the end , we decided to wait for both hosts and guests , before we ordered them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we examined a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how likely it is that people trust one another , how much they are in terms of age and living .
little surprising , we trust the people most similar to us .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural social pres@@ umed .
it will be exciting if you add the call of a person -- in our case by Be@@ ur@@ gency .
if you have less than three not@@ if@@ ications , nothing changes .
but if you have more than ten , everything changes .
a good reputation st@@ aff@@ ing comm@@ on@@ alities .
so the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted pre@@ ferences .
moreover , we drove that trust is dependent on how much man can be found .
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if one tells too little , for example &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hi ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you get no answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one tells too much , such as : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; &quot; &quot; -- -- the request is rather not accepted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so there is an optimal level of op@@ enness , for example &quot; Great art works in your home ! I do with my family vacation . &quot;
how can I create it with design to create this degree of op@@ enness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips to which themes you should write something .
our entire company builds on hope that the right design can help , overcome our pre@@ judi@@ ces against strangers .
what we did not reck@@ on was the great amount of people who were more than ready to place these pre@@ judi@@ ces .
here you see how many people take our offer .
you can recognize three things .
first : incredibly good luck .
secon@@ dly : the ti@@ reless work of our team .
third , a need that had not been covered before .
the business is very good for us .
of course there are times if not everything goes smoothly .
there were guests who have been allowed to celebrate parties or devast@@ ated apartments .
hosts will have guests in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked on the customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I was standing at the fore@@ front , when trust has been broken .
there &apos;s nothing worse than those calls . it &apos;s hurt when I remember .
the dis@@ appointment you hear in the voice of the c@@ aller , and will always be our greatest motivation to improve .
fortunately only one fra@@ ction had a problem from the 123 million overnight stays .
because people confi@@ ded to each other .
when confidence works , there can be done miracles .
one of our guests did vacation in Uruguay . he suffered a heart attack there .
his host was going to hospital .
he even donated blood to the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
&quot; perfect house for trav@@ ellers , which tend to heart attacks due to sitting activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with adequate hospitals .
Javier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real gu@@ ardian angels who save lives , even though they don &apos;t know it correctly .
you drive one in your own car to the hospital when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want you feel lonely , they bring books over .
you can stay a longer stay , without charge extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
thus , of course , not every stay is starting .
but these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
when I stum@@ bled upon this term for the first time , I asked myself :
how does the idea of sharing with monetary transactions fit together ?
it &apos;s about an economic trading here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but now it just simply &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ten@@ ing industry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not just the case . &quot; &quot; &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people put a part of itself , and this changes everything .
when you are traveling today , it is easy to compare with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
what if travel would be a rich buffet would be from local impressions ?
what if in any place you have visited , a group would be waiting there to fill a thoroughly thoroughly and to show a Knei@@ pent@@ our neighborhood there , of which you have never heard ;
or if you could learn cooking from a five star chef ?
nowadays , flats are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would like to arrange apartments from the ground up to each other ?
what would this look like ?
what if cities would have received the minds of common share ?
I imagine cities which allow us society and relations , instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and isolation .
in South Korea , Seoul , this project was already begun . lots of parking places belonging to the government ,
residents are now offered to residents . students who were looking for a lead ,
were delivered to people whose children were out . they were started incub@@ ators ,
in order to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy , night . over our platform alone will be 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries at a stranger or even hosts .
the idea seems to be not as crazy as it was taught us .
we have not invented the wheel .
hospitality has been there before .
there were already similar websites before us .
so why did our work exactly ?
apart from luck and timing , we realized that you can find the right design with the ingredients of confidence .
design can help us overcome deeply rooted pre@@ judi@@ ces .
I think it bl@@ oss@@ oms ,
down@@ right overwhelming .
I have to think about it whenever a red Maz@@ da drives on me .
we know , of course , that design cannot solve any problem .
but if it could help us , if it had this great influence , I wonder what we can use design for soon .
thank you .
what do you think when you watch me ?
a credit@@ or ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or supp@@ ressed , bra@@ in@@ washed , under@@ going a terrorist attack ?
or just a delay in safety at the airport .
this is actually true .
I do not give you the blame for your negative impressions .
this is how the media represent people that look like me .
a study found that 80 % of the coverage of Islam and Muslims are negative .
studies show : the Americans mean , most would not know Muslims .
probably people do not speak with their U@@ ber drivers .
for all those who have never met a Muslims : it &apos;s great , you know .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee machine -- double es@@ pres@@ so , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a Mö@@ ch@@ te@@ ers @-@ Fitness @-@ fan@@ atic ,
and I am a pract@@ iti@@ ful , spiritual Muslims .
but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not born .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I decided to do so . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when I was 17 , I met my decision to ou@@ ten me .
no , not as homosex@@ ual man , as some of my friends , but as Muslims . I decided to bear the Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head cover .
my femin@@ ist girl@@ friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot;
at that time , it was a femin@@ ist declaration of independence , which I felt as a 17 @-@ year old man felt like to adapt to a perfect and un@@ att@@ achable beauty ideal .
I have not only accepted the faith of my parents .
I have to do with the Kor@@ an .
I read it , thought , question@@ ed , doub@@ ted and believed .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
she was trust and slow dev@@ otion which deep@@ ened itself with each reading of the Kor@@ an .
the beauty of rhythm brings me to tears sometimes .
I recognize myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
have you ever felt the feeling that someone you perc@@ ei@@ ves you fully under@@ stands , and yet somehow loves ?
that &apos;s how it feels .
later I married and began , like all the good Egyptians , my career as a engineer .
I had later , after my marriage , a child , and lived in the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American dream . &quot;
then came the terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast at the end looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rush message &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was smoke , planes flew in buildings , people jumped out of the buildings .
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical distur@@ b@@ ance ?
my shock changed rapidly into indig@@ nation .
why should we do something ?
&quot; &quot; ... &quot; I switched to the TV channel and heard : &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; Muslim terrorists &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ji@@ had ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oh my God .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not only my country being attacked , but in N@@ u turned the deeds of others from a citizen in a susp@@ ect . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that same day we had to drive through the Middle West in the USA to move into a new city and start with the post@@ graduate studies .
I remember how I drove away -- as we were silent -- so deeply it went into my seat , and I was afraid to be recognized as Muslims .
we moved to our apartment in this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then I heard , and read , and read the war@@ nings of the national Islamic organisations , which said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be alert , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stay in well lit areas , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t cher@@ ish you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed for the whole week inside .
then it was Friday in that week -- the day before Muslims gather to prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and again the war@@ nings : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t go on this first Friday , mosque could be a goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered and I heard of attacks in Muslims or people who were held for Muslims , thrown into the Free and defeated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because the people who had attacked this country , have attacked our country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have already swe@@ pt the rage of people to terrorists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to declare yourself constantly .
I have nothing about questions , I love questions .
it is the accus@@ ations that are hard .
nowadays we can actually hear people say : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it &apos;s called Muslims .
when will we go ? &quot;
some people want to join Muslims and mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church as from a tum@@ our in the body of the USA .
only the question arises : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tumor is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor , one sees only under observation .
the alternatives are poin@@ tless because the question is wrong .
Muslims are , like all other Americans , not a tumor in the body of the United States , but an essential organ .
thank you !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , Saviour and Olymp@@ ics .
is the closure of mos@@ ques of America safer ?
there might be a few parking spaces , but do not stop terror .
regular visiting of a mosque leads to people with other belief toler@@ ant , and to show larger citizens .
and as a leader of the police in the Washington region , DC recently told : people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques .
they will be radic@@ alised in their cellar or in front of a computer .
in the Radi@@ ation Process we noted that it begins online . as a first , the person is cut off by their family , that the person believes the terrorists are the true Muslims , and everyone who dis@@ gu@@ ise the true Muslims , and of their ide@@ ology , is a tra@@ itor or by faith .
if we want to prevent radic@@ alisation , we must stop the people to go to the mosque .
some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group founded their brut@@ ality with the Kor@@ an .
as a Muslim , mother , as a human being , I think we must do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would add to their imagination , if you recognize it as a representative of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x @-@ Kl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ide@@ ology on their &quot; Holy Book . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if you throw a look at them , she does not throw what they read in their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Scripture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality , which they can read these things in Scripture .
an outstanding Im@@ am told me recently an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she had prec@@ eded to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the problem was just the opposite . every spirit that she spoke , brought them to silence , and told her that her anger was in the world to put her in trouble . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of nothing inspi@@ res and something that would have given their rage , it was a main goal for the instrument@@ alisation by extrem@@ ists who spoke a solution .
this Im@@ am set the connection to God and her church again .
instead of acc@@ use them for their anger , he showed their constructive way for a real change in the world .
she learned what she learned in the mosque , so she kept to join the IS .
that was an insight as the Islam@@ opho@@ bia concerned me and my family .
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it work for each other ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day , on our mind freedom ?
a study -- actually several neuro@@ science studies -- show : if we fear , at least three things happen .
we rather accept an author@@ itarian government system , con@@ form@@ ity and pre@@ judi@@ ces .
a study shows : if you report test individuals , in which neg@@ atively about Muslims , they were rather military attacks on Muslim countries and the circumc@@ ision of American Muslims .
this is not just a physical problem .
if you look at the mood against Muslims upwards -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terror attacks .
it happened in the advance of Iraq &apos;s war and two const@@ ancy periods .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Mos@@ lem terror as I expected it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can actually be a tool to manipul@@ ate the public in order to gr@@ ind the foundation of a free society , sensible and well @-@ informed citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
dealing with Muslims is a early warning sign .
we might feel it as the first , but the toxic air is sc@@ ared of all of us .
in the assignment of collective debt , it is not only about to explain himself .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina where both went to school .
De@@ ah was a sport@@ s@@ men .
he was at the dental clinic , talented , promising ...
his sister would say to me that he was the sweet , most generous person , whom she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was stun@@ ned and said :
&quot; when is such a young man coming out of my breasts ? &quot;
just a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne in her brother and his wife , her neighbor , Craig Stephen H@@ icks , she was murdered , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who had posted in the afternoon as in an execution after he posted out@@ ings against Muslims on his Facebook page .
he shot at De@@ ah eight times .
fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism can not only be imm@@ oral , but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
are we gone to the mosque or did we stay safe at home ?
we bes@@ et it and for us it was not a light decision , for it was about whom America we want to leave our children : one that we can control our religion , or one in whom we can freely practise our religion .
we decided for the mosque .
with our son in the children &apos;s seat we drove to the mosque with high pressure .
I took him out , and went out , and went out into the prayer hall , and what I saw , let me hold .
the hall was completely filled .
then the Im@@ am made an announcement , than@@ ked and welcomed our guests , as the half of the gathered together were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hist@@ s , ath@@ ei@@ sts , believers , and non @-@ believers who had come to attack us , but to join us .
at that moment I went together .
these people were there because they had courage and con@@ dol@@ ences and pre@@ judi@@ ces .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose in the moment of fear and fan@@ at@@ ism ?
will you be sure to go safe ?
or will you connect to those who think : we are better than those .
thank you .
thank you nice !
Helen Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve .
but I wonder what you say , perhaps you say that you have a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a thought to work with deep thinking , so an exception and not the rule are .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , do not be dec@@ ei@@ ving . I &apos;m completely normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
if you look at Muslims around the world , and I did that with the biggest ever carried out study on Muslims around the world , people want normal things .
they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I am an exception in no regard .
if humans appear as a rule , usually the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to rule .
HW : thank you very much . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what started as a platform for Bast@@ ers , a billion dollar store is about to be reached .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . made possible in research institutions worldwide .
before air pur@@ ification has entered our social consciousness , a autonomous fleet of flying machines in the F@@ RAC Centre in France have built a six @-@ metre @-@ high tower from 1 500 bricks . some years ago , they began to fly with rop@@ es .
connect devices high speed and acceleration to the closest space .
you can also build self @-@ fle@@ dged structures .
they have learned to carry loads to deal with turbul@@ ence and react generally to natural laws .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the limits of possible flight in autonomous flight .
thus a system works autonom@@ ously , it must know collec@@ tively what the mobile objects are located in the room .
in our laboratory at ETH Zurich , we often use external cameras to find objects . that allows us to focus on rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demos , we use a new location technology of Ver@@ ity Studios , a branch of our laboratories .
there are no external cameras .
each flight machine has internal sensors to determine position in space , determine calculations on board what the machine should do .
external commands are on top eb@@ le@@ e. g. &quot; start &quot; and &quot; land &quot; land .
this is a so @-@ called rear starter ,
a pilot device , which tries to strike two flying with a f@@ lap .
like other Star@@ r@@ hi@@ kers , it is efficient in reverse flight , much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations .
in contrast to most Star@@ r@@ ots it can float , and has great advantages with start and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a swe@@ eping side .
a limitation of tail@@ star@@ ters is that they react sensiti@@ vely to turbul@@ ence like wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the air@@ ship doesn &apos;t matter in which position the optimal location can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay . OK .
during our research , we often introduce basic abstract issues that penet@@ rate to the core of the issue .
such a question would be : what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for doing the answer to such a question .
there are helicop@@ ters for example , known as machines with a thousand moving parts that accum@@ ulate to you .
in decades ago , pilot controlled pilots could fly remote controlled machines , which had only two mov@@ able parts : a prop@@ eller and a tail@@ gate .
not long ago we discovered that flying is working with only one .
this is the monster inner , the mechan@@ est sim@@ pl@@ est flying device . it was invented recently .
it has only a moving part , a prop@@ eller ,
no clari@@ ons , hing@@ es and trans@@ itions , no further actu@@ ator or control surfaces , only one prop@@ eller .
although it is mechan@@ ically simple , it happens very much in the inter@@ iors , so that it can fly stable and move to the room .
nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the tail@@ gate . to bring it to flying , I have to put it right .
the lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood of throwing it right , if you look at all , is small , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed last night .
if the mon@@ osp@@ inner is a practice in pleas@@ antly , this machine is here , the Omni@@ kop@@ ter with his eight prop@@ ellers , a exercise in excess .
what to do with all this excess ?
they see that it is only symmet@@ rical .
therefore , he is ambi@@ valent in his alignment .
thereby he receives the au@@ sp@@ acy capability ,
moving in space in all directions , no matter what direction he rot@@ ates or even rot@@ ated .
of course , it is complex , mainly in the field of interactive rivers from eight prop@@ ellers .
some can be set in models , the rest is learned directly when flying .
let us see that .
if air machines have to be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine consists of two separate two @-@ prop@@ eller machines .
these rot@@ ates clock@@ wise
and the others against the clock@@ wise .
when you build it , they be@@ have like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
if anything goes wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller is falling , the electronics or a battery -- can fly the machine even if limited .
we will demonstrate that , by making a half air@@ worthy .
the last demonstration exam@@ ines synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units enables a range of aesthetic expression .
we took standard micro @-@ quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equi@@ ps them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where in space it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore there is no upper limit .
hopefully , you will motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to re@@ think new revolutionary ideas .
the especially safe machine there would like to be a flying lamp@@ shade on Broadway .
of course , it is difficult to pre@@ dict the influence of this technology .
for types like us lies the salary in the development and the creation act .
it serves as a memory , wonderful and ench@@ anting our universe , and that there are creative , smart creatures allowed to form them in a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the bag on the i .
thank you .
1.3 billion years ago cir@@ cling in a very far away galaxy two black holes are increasingly quicker , they walked as the mass thir@@ sts in pure energy in a ten@@ ths of pure energy .
this short moment she lit bri@@ ghter than all the stars together in all the galax@@ ies of the entire universe .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
her energy did not replace them in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was delivered into space @-@ time @-@ create and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we arrange the events at first time .
1.3 billion years ago was just a majority life on earth .
since then the earth has resulted in a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , Sau@@ rier , people and -- God stand up to -- even the internet .
about 25 years ago a group of particularly cour@@ ageous -- R@@ ai Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Tur@@ ver from Cal@@ tech -- had a huge laser detector to look for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , which are caused by col@@ li@@ ant black holes .
most of them held them crazy for crazy .
but enough people recognized them as crazy geni@@ uses so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea .
after decades of development , design , design and extremely much more hard work they built the detector Lig@@ o : the laser inter@@ fer@@ omet@@ er- Gra@@ vit@@ ational Ob@@ servatory .
in the following time , the precision of Lig@@ o was significantly increased , which improved the recognition performance enorm@@ ously .
therefore you call it Advanced Lig@@ o .
beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a last attempt to clari@@ fy some small , stub@@ born problems .
on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after commissioning of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ro@@ uted the two col@@ li@@ ding black holes across the earth .
they went through you and me
and through the detector .
Scott Hughes : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the part@@ ing of my death father .
basically , they were the fruits of my life .
all that I had worked for is no longer Science Fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he studied Gra@@ vit@@ ational waves from black holes and their through ob@@ servatory like Lig@@ o measur@@ able signals . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ?
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a housing in the structure of space and time .
by passing the wave , the space and its whole content will be stretched in one direction and the other is stretched .
to illustr@@ ate lec@@ turers in courses for the theory of rel@@ ativity is often a true dance .
&quot; stretch and du@@ sty , stretch and du@@ sty . &quot;
the problem is that gravity shafts are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous .
on September 14 , for instance , each one of us was stretched out in the wake of the waves . the stretch of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 .
that means 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1 . therefore , one stated the Lig@@ o staff for crazy .
with a five @-@ kilometre laser detector , and that &apos;s already absurd , this length should be exactly measured in less than a thou@@ sand@@ al of a nuclear power radius . that &apos;s gr@@ ot@@ esque .
at the end of his classical text about gra@@ vit@@ ation
described Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder L@@ IG@@ Os , the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties when building such det@@ ectors are huge .
but physi@@ c@@ ists are fin@@ anci@@ ally and with the support of the public , all obstacles will be overcome . &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to Lig@@ o . Scott claims that Lig@@ o is more an ear than one eye .
I &apos;d like to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavel@@ ength that is much smaller than things around us : facial features , the size of your mobile phone .
this is quite practical . because so you can make a picture or map of things by taking the light around you around .
in tones this is different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
this is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean you particularly much :
about the face of your child .
instead we listen to specific properties like audio and height , rhythm and volume to close the story behind .
&quot; I &apos;m talking about Alice . &quot;
&quot; and Bob interrup@@ ts them . &quot;
&quot; d@@ ummer Bob . &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we can &apos;t make any simple images of objects in all with them .
but by doing changes in ampl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble area .
so if we convert waves to sound , we can literally listen to all .
to listen to the gra@@ vit@@ ation , he can tell us about the coll@@ ision of two black holes so that my colleague Scott has already been busy .
SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , it &apos;s simple : w@@ up@@ p !
spin the two bodies very fast , you hear the same circuit with an additional sound change . that sounds like : W@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u !
it is a kind of movement vocab@@ ulary , stamped in the wav@@ e@@ form .
AA : on 14 September 2015 -- a date that at least I never forget -- Lig@@ o heard the following : &#91; Sur@@ render of the sound &#93; J@@ anybody who knows what he must hear , recognize this as sound of -- SH : ... two black holes each with 30 times sun mass , which revol@@ ve around as fast as the rods of your Mix@@ ers .
AA : let us consider what this means .
two black holes , the di@@ ch@@ est body in all , one with a mass of 29 prob@@ es , the other with a mass of 36 s@@ uns , each other three times a second , before they col@@ li@@ de .
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know this because we have heard it .
therein lies the permanent importance of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o is a whole new way to investig@@ ate the universe as it never was possible .
on this way we can listen to all things and hear the visible .
we can &apos;t see much in all -- practically or basically -- not .
a Super@@ nova , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ol@@ ks explo@@ de stars in super nov@@ ae .
they are very useful . of them we have learned much about this .
the exciting physical processes will occur at the core , which is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and silicon .
we will never see , as these op@@ ak are .
gra@@ vit@@ ational waves penet@@ rate iron , as it would be transparent glass . I would love to explore the first few minutes of the universe , but we &apos;ll never see it , since the urine is obsc@@ ured by his own offspring .
using gra@@ vit@@ ational waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
and most import@@ antly : I am optimistic that we have never seen in all things we have never seen , and of whom we have never seen . things we can only discover by listening .
in fact , Lig@@ o found things straight in the first attempt , which we did not expect .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Evans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says to this topic : me : the type of stars , which create black holes , are the dinosau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient body from prehistoric times . the black holes are so to speak for our ar@@ cheological work .
Lig@@ o allows us to view a completely different perspective on the events of all , on the emergence of the stars and ultimately , as we went out of this chaos .
AA : the challenge now exists to be as bold as possible .
thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the noise of the cos@@ mos .
we need ideas for new ob@@ servatory -- a brand new generation of ob@@ servatory on Earth and in all .
for what could be more beautiful than to listen to the urine itself ?
now is the time of great dreams .
do you dream with us .
thank you .
some time I tried an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one year I would say to everything &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feared that I was afraid . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it doesn &apos;t matter if it was nervous to me in unpleasant situations , I forced me to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
would I speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
did I want to be live on TV ?
no , but yes !
did I want to play with the acting ?
no , no , no , yes yes yes . yes .
and a crazy thing happened : exactly that which I feared , I feared my fear .
my fear to keep talking , my social fear -- pu@@ ff , gone .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes , my life has changed .
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
but there was a certain fact that my life changed deeply , un@@ exp@@ ec@@ tedly . it began with a question of my young ones .
I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the youngest , calls out of in@@ explic@@ able reasons all the &quot; swe@@ ets , &quot;
as if she was a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; swe@@ ets , I need milk for my be@@ ak money . &quot;
she once asked me if I could play with her , when I was just on the jump . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
a new setting of life in my family . from then on I sw@@ am to play with them . no matter what I &apos;m doing , or where I go , I say always Yes -- every single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I am very busy .
it has a magic effect on me , my children , on our family .
but it also has an intri@@ gu@@ ing side effect : actually I fully understood that &quot; Yes &quot; -@@ S@@ agen to play with my children my career saved .
I have a real dream job .
I am an author . I think of things , awake for life .
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I create TV . I produce TV .
I do TV , in a big style .
in this TV season I am responsible to carry out 70 hours of program into the world .
four TV programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are in production simultaneously .
each shipment provides hundreds of jobs that did not exist .
the budget for an episode of a television station can be between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
a new episode all nine days , four TV programs , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three broad@@ casts , which are simultaneously in production , four , 16 episodes : sc@@ andal , 15 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours TV ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my tel@@ ev@@ isions run one another on Thursday night .
around the world , my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are Shows , which I created myself , and not only produced , so I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans of the camp@@ fire and tell my stories .
four TV series , 70 hours television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires that are burning around the world .
do you know who else does it ?
nobody , that &apos;s why I &apos;m a Titan .
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to im@@ press you .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I say it because I know what you think if the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; author &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; falls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I tell you that all of you are working so hard if you &apos;re working a company , a country or a classroom , so you understand that I &apos;m not only working on the computer , so that I say , I understand that I &apos;m not only dre@@ aming at a dream job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s all a job , all work , everything reality , everything blood -- not tears .
I work a lot , hard and I love it .
if I have deep@@ ened the work , there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a country out of nothing .
it is when I set troops on , as I painted on a screen .
so as pregnant , one has a high tone , depth a marathon .
you feel like Be@@ yon@@ c@@ é .
and all this at the same time .
I love to work .
it is creative , mechanical , exhau@@ sting and in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ating , funny and distur@@ bing , cruel and maternal , cruel and reasonable . and the best of it is the sum .
there is such a change in me when working is going well .
a sum@@ s starts in my head , and it grows and grows , and the sum@@ s sounds like a busy road , I could drive forever .
many people assume if I explain the sum@@ s that I write about writing that writing to me is joy .
don &apos;t understand me wrong , it does .
but the sum@@ s -- when I began to work and work with the TV production , when I began to work and work , establish , create and cooperate , I discovered this thing , this sum , this energy . the sum@@ s !
the sum@@ s is more than writing .
the sum is action and activity . the sum of sum@@ s is a drug .
the sum of music is music . the sum@@ s is light and air .
the sum@@ s is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a sum@@ s , you can &apos;t stri@@ ve differently than size .
the feeling of being unable to stri@@ ve for size , no matter what price .
this is what you call the sum@@ s .
or maybe it means to be a work@@ ah@@ olic .
perhaps it &apos;s called gen@@ ius .
maybe it &apos;s ego .
maybe it &apos;s the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I only know that I did not fail for failure , and I just know that I love the sum@@ s .
I just want to tell you , I &apos;m a Titan , and I know I don &apos;t want to ask .
to make a clear one : the more successful I get , the more episodes , the more work there , the more things at the same time , the more things the same time , the more I write history , the more expectations there are .
the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the country I create , the marathon , whom I run , the army , the high clay , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s .
I like this sum . I love the sum@@ s .
I need the sum@@ s . I am the sum@@ s .
am I just this sum@@ s ?
and then the sum@@ s stopped .
revised , ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated , ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated , burnt out .
the sum@@ s stopped .
now my three daughters are acc@@ ust@@ omed to the truth , that her mom@@ my is a single working title .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ per tells people : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my mom@@ my will not be there , but you can write my N@@ anny . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and Emer@@ son says , &quot; Evalu@@ ate , I want to go to Sh@@ onda land . &quot;
they are the children of a Titan@@ en .
they are baby @-@ Titan@@ en .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the sum@@ s heard .
the sum@@ s of the engine stopped .
I did not love my work anymore . the engine was off .
the sum@@ s did not come back .
my sum@@ s was broken .
I made the same things as always : the same Titan@@ en @-@ Work , 15 @-@ Hour @-@ Days , executed weekends , no regret , a Titan sleeps not , does not exist with all my heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no Sum@@ ma .
in me , silence was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four television programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was an indication of the Titan ,
everything was grey , I just didn &apos;t have fun anymore .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the sum@@ s and the sum@@ s was me .
so what do you do if that is what you do , the work you love , suddenly f@@ aded ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know some people like to think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gras@@ p yourself , stupid author Titan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know you are doing it , you are working , you do , one loves to be a teacher , a painter , Bill Gates , you just love one another , and that gives the sum of the sum if you ever knew the sum@@ s , if you stop the sum@@ s , who is then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
when the song of my heart stops , I can survive in silence ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then my &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; southern states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asks me a question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am on the way out without , and she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I don &apos;t want to say no more when two things are aware of :
first , I must say Yes to everything and secon@@ dly , they never called me &quot; swe@@ ep . &quot;
she calls no more &quot; Evalu@@ ate . &quot;
when did it happen ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hate it if I am Titan and my sum@@ s , and here all changes before my own eyes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I say : &quot; yes . &quot;
this is nothing special .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we play and her sisters to@@ ast , we laugh a lot and I read completely out of the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it is outstanding because my pain and panic , in sol@@ itude and lack of sum@@ mens , I cannot do anything except match .
I am focused .
I am quiet .
the country I create , the marathon , whom I run , the army , the screen , the high clay - they don &apos;t exist anymore .
everything that exists are st@@ icky fingers and mo@@ ist k@@ isses , delicate voices , wax cra@@ y@@ ons and the song in which it goes to let it go , or whatever the girl in &quot; The Iron Queen . &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air in this place is so scar@@ ce that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
play is the opposite of work .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ sol@@ ves .
a mental door goes on and an energy lift comes in .
and that &apos;s not right , but it happens .
I feel it .
the sum@@ s come back slowly .
no full volume , barely there , it &apos;s quiet , hardly audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there .
not the sum , but a sum@@ s .
and now I feel like I would know a magical mystery .
but let &apos;s stay in the case .
it is Love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we &apos;ve forgotten .
the sum@@ s , the working sum@@ s , the Titan@@ ens@@ um , that is only the replacement .
if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , if I &apos;m using broadcast and TV hours and how working my brain is , then I forgot what the real sum@@ s is .
the sum of sum@@ s is no power and it is not working specifically .
it depends on the pleasure .
the real sum@@ s depends on love .
the sum@@ s is the river , which comes from the vitality of life .
genuine sum@@ s is self @-@ awareness and peace .
genuine sum@@ s ignored the pressure of history , which are to experience di@@ ligen@@ ce , expect@@ ation and pressure .
the real sum@@ s is simple and original .
the real sum@@ s is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered to me the false words , for which God told me that I am a Titan ?
it is just love .
we all need a little more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say Yes .
I do this as a rule , so I can free myself from any gu@@ ilt as a work@@ ah@@ olic .
it is law , I have no other choice . I have no other choice if I want to hear the sum@@ s again .
I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good at games , I don &apos;t like it .
play is not ans@@ at@@ orial for me , how to work .
the truth hur@@ ts ,
but I don &apos;t like it to play .
I always work , because I love it .
I am better at work than at home .
this conc@@ ession is painful , because what a man is working rather than to house ?
well , I think .
be honest , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; --
I have to have problems .
that I &apos;m too relaxed , none of them is .
we ras@@ en around in the garden , before and back , and forth .
we make small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we burst into soap bubbles .
I feel mainly st@@ iff , absent and confused .
I always g@@ ust according to my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
my children show me how to live , and the sum of the universe meets me .
I play and play until I ask myself : why did we stop playing with playing ?
they can do it too ! they always say Yes , if your child wants to play with you .
maybe you &apos;ll keep me nai@@ ve for a day@@ dream .
you are right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et Show figure .
your child finds you less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play at most 15 minutes with me until they conclude that they want to make something different .
it &apos;s wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes , a lad@@ y@@ bug or bis@@ cuit replaced me .
and my teenage daughter speaks for 15 minutes with me , I am the mother of the year .
there are only 15 minutes , there &apos;s no need for more .
each one can bring about 15 minutes , even on a bad mood !
15 minutes a piece !
no mobile phone , no laundry , no di@@ stra@@ ction .
the day is short : dinner , the children beg@@ ged .
but 15 minutes are inside !
my children are my delight , my world . you don &apos;t have to be the children . it is true to feel the sum@@ s to have a place for his peace of peace .
it &apos;s not about playing with their own children . it &apos;s about joy ,
to &quot; Play &quot; in general .
treat yourself to 15 minutes !
find out what doing well .
find out and keep it .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I th@@ wart and I won . friends meet , read books , enjoy the day --
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot; it &apos;s just for everything I quit when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in the training when I wanted to sur@@ pass myself more and more .
15 minutes on the piece , why not allow full 15 minutes to allow yourself ?
what can be wrong about it ? nothing !
the sum@@ s came back in my spare time . sum@@ s seems to return when I &apos;m not working .
working doesn &apos;t work without games .
it takes time , but after a few months , a door , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office . I hear an unknown melody , it ful@@ fills me and my soul . I am looking forward to new ideas . I use it into full trains and love my work again .
I like the sum@@ s , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I am not the sum@@ s that sum@@ s is not me ... no more .
soap bubbles and st@@ icky fingers , dinner with friends .
this is my Sum@@ ma .
the sum of life .
the sum of love .
the sum of work is part of me , but just a part . and so I am so grateful .
it is me to sni@@ ff me that I have a Titan . I have never seen a Titan , the trip to Jerusalem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes to less work and more games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and yet I have everything in hand . my brain is still working . my bon@@ fires are still burning .
the more I play , the more happ@@ ier I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel like a good mother .
the more I play , the clear@@ er is my head .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the sum@@ s . the country I can run , the marathon , whom I run , the clo@@ cks , the sw@@ men , the sum , the sum , the sum , the sum of the sum , the sum of life .
the more I feel this sum@@ s , the more this unusual , be@@ ating , naked , and new feeling of life in me wide . less Titan -- more I !
the more I feel this sum@@ s , the more I know who I am .
I am an author . I think of things , I awake for life .
it belongs to the job , which means to live his dream .
this is the dream of this job ,
for a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to less work and more games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Titan@@ en have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you nice .
I am Neuro@@ surgical .
like most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human trage@@ dies .
I know how your life can change from one second to another , after a serious stroke or an automobile accident .
it is very fru@@ str@@ ating for us , that the brain , unlike other bodi@@ ly organs , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing .
patients often have a lasting , severe disability after a severe injury to the central nervous system .
this is probably the reason why I became functional neuro@@ surgery .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor , who tries to improve the nerve function by various surgical measures .
sure , they have heard of one of the most famous , &quot; Tie@@ pol@@ hir@@ n@@ stimulation . &quot; thereby we im@@ planted a electro@@ de deep in the brain to influence the circuits of neur@@ ons so that the neurolog@@ ical function improved .
it really is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Park@@ inson , who suffered severe trem@@ bling and heavy pain .
Neuro@@ mod@@ ulation however does not mean ne@@ uro healing .
the dream functional Neuro@@ surgeon is the rest@@ oring of the brain .
in my opinion , we approach this dream .
I &apos;d like to show you that we are very close .
with some help , the brain can help itself .
the story began 15 years ago .
at the time I was a senior Consult@@ ant and worked day and night in the emergency room .
often I supply patients with skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma .
you must imagine that the brain is inc@@ lined at the brain @-@ brain trau@@ ma and inc@@ lined the cran@@ ial pressure .
to save life , one must reduce the cran@@ king pressure .
sometimes you need to remove a part of a s@@ wollen brain mass .
instead of throwing the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a biolog@@ ist , the brain mass .
what do I mean by this ?
we wanted to grow cells from this tissue .
this is not a easy task .
to fer@@ ment cells from a rif@@ le is comparable to very small children who will be out of your families .
you have to find the proper nutrition , temperature , moisture and the environments to th@@ ri@@ ve them flour@@ ish .
that &apos;s exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts there was Jean François .
he saw this under his micro@@ scope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked like a tri@@ bal culture . with large green cells surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells .
perhaps you still know of the biological classes that stem cells are un@@ ripe , which can transform into any cellular type of the organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small niche of the brain .
it is surprising to obtain this kind of stem cells from the surface mass of the brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very fast .
they never die , they are immort@@ al .
but these cells were different .
they split slowly , and after a few weeks they even died .
so we saw a new , strange cellular population , who looked like stem cells , but beha@@ ved differently .
we needed long to understand from where they came .
they originate from these cells .
these blue and red cells called Dou@@ ble@@ c@@ ort@@ in @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
you make 4 % of our cereb@@ ral cor@@ tex .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the stage of the fet@@ us , they ensure the cause of the brain .
but why are they staying with us ?
we do not know this .
we believe that they are taking part in healing the brain since we find it in higher concentrations close to brain injuries .
this is not so sure .
but one thing is clear -- of these cells we got our stem cells .
we are facing a potential cell source that allows brain healing .
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to remove a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ lingu@@ istic area and then the cells are just that cul@@ tured as Jean @-@ François did .
and then mark them in colour to track them in the brain .
in the last step , we planned it to the custom@@ ization of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous Tran@@ splan@@ tation -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ transplan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we plan to plan these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we planned the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller we could work with monkey .
in the first scenario we planned the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that they were taken up after a few weeks , they would go back home . the room is already occupied , so they are not needed , so they disappear .
in the second scenario we added a violation and so we planned the same cells and now the cells were obtained -- they grew up to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells , which have not been planned .
the evidence that they show are these small points . these are the cells that we in vitro , coloured in the culture .
of course we could not stop .
can these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual skill task .
they had to take food pellets with a tray .
they did that very well .
when they reached a stable skill level , we climbed the motor@@ ized cor@@ tex .
afterwards , the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they couldn &apos;t move their hand anymore .
just as it would happen in people , they recre@@ ated spont@@ ane@@ ously to a certain degree , just like a stroke .
the patients are paraly@@ zed and then try to recover themselves with the help of plastic bra@@ ins . they relax at some degree , just as in the monkey .
when we were sure that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left you see the monkeys that caught spont@@ ane@@ ously .
it can bring about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from the violation .
it is not as precise and not so fast .
now you see when we planned the cells , the same monkey , two months after the her@@ plant@@ ation .
I can tell you that were very exciting results for us too .
since that time , we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can freeze them and later .
we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for instance at Park@@ inson &apos;s disease .
but our dream is still to im@@ itate them in humans .
I really hope that I can show you soon as the human brain gives the means to heal itself .
thank you .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Jo@@ cel@@ y@@ ne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that now , several dozen people in the audience , perhaps even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can need this . &quot;
I definitely come .
of course , the question is what are the biggest obstacles before you start clinical trials .
Jo@@ cel@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results you have to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to pass these kinds of studies .
BG : that is understand@@ able , the brain is very delicate , etc .
J@@ B : yes , but it needs a long time , a lot of patience and a almost professional team .
BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it will take until someone can come to the hospital , and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s difficult to say .
first it depends on the approval of the clinical study .
will it allow us to launch it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to select patients who make treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
then you have to apply this to a multic@@ entr@@ e study .
you must first prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : Jo@@ cel@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting TE@@ D and that you have told us about it .
BG : thanks a lot .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider it as of course .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t see democracy as the frag@@ ile plant which it is in reality but as a inventory of our society . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we tend to consider it as imm@@ utable awareness .
we believe capitalism inev@@ it@@ ably leads to democracy .
that is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Ye@@ w from Singapore and his big night@@ mare in Beijing have doub@@ tless demonstrated that it is possible to have a blo@@ oming capitalism and impressive growth while the policy is completely un@@ democratic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , democracy comes with us , in Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
beginning of the year when I re@@ represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was declared to me as finance minister in the Euro@@ group , that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- not to affect the austerity programs that were realized in Greece .
at this moment , I thought that there would be no better just@@ ification for Lee Ku@@ an Ye@@ w or the Communist Party of China , or some of my sincere friends who asked me that democracy would be abolished if it would change anything .
at this point I would like to introduce an economic model for a real democracy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I pray you , together with me , believe that Lee Ku@@ an Ye@@ w , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group of a mistake , we could save democracy , but that we need a true and def@@ en@@ tive democracy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for without democracy our societies are united , our future glo@@ omy and our great new technologies are w@@ asted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the topic of waste I would like to point you to an interesting contra@@ diction , the currently our economies are threatened .
I call it the &quot; twin summit par@@ adox . &quot;
one top is known to you . you know and recognize it as the debt mountain , who casts its long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognize the debt mountain ,
but only a few recognize his Di@@ dy@@ mus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a mountain of un@@ used cash which is to be anxi@@ ous to invest it there where it would be productive and income , with whom it could produce the debt mountain and also produce all the things that humanity urgently needs , for example &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; energy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I call them two numbers .
in the past 3 months , in the United States , in England and in the Eurozone , 3.4 tr@@ illion dollars were invested in all the wealth of producing goods such as industrial buildings , machines , office buildings , schools , streets , tracks , equipment , and so on .
3.4 billion US dollars a lot of money that is compar@@ ing to $ 5.1 billion US dollars , which were around the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing did , except the ex@@ changes to blow up and raised real estate prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , debts and un@@ productive capital form the twin summit that do not compens@@ ate themselves by the usual market mechanisms . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is stag@@ nat@@ ing wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds intensi@@ fying , and consequently a low total demand for investors , which would not be investing in a low demand that it would not be true . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just like Ö@@ di@@ pus Father , of fear , prophecy that his son would kill him if he will grow up . &quot; &quot; &quot;
un@@ inten@@ tionally , the circumstances brought forth that Ö@@ di@@ pus kills him .
this is my hair with capitalism --
&quot; &quot; &quot; his extremely we@@ ath@@ ic art . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives and improve our lives and especially all the technologies , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
is democracy the solution ?
but before we continue , what do we understand about democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as a corporate form , in which the free and the poor as a majority control the government .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy , of course , ended too many --
women , fore@@ ig@@ ner , and of course slaves .
however , there would be a mistake to reduce the job value of Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy because of these inclu@@ sions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ruling on the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that she gave them the working poor , but not only the right to freedom of expression , but important and crucial for them to agree to them the right to political participation with equal tuning in questions of stat@@ ute . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy did not hold long ago --
like a candle , which shines very bright , it is also burned out quickly .
however , our liberal democratic demo@@ cra@@ cies do not have their roots in antique Athens ,
but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which ultimately was a stat@@ ute for rulers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the liberal democracy was only possible when a complete separation of politics and economy was only possible , while the economy -- so the world of corpor@@ ations -- a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy @-@ free zone &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in today &apos;s demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time of this separation of politics and business began , an un@@ itary struggle between the two and the economy gradually mig@@ rates to politics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you wonder why the politicians do not know more like earlier ?
it is not on a de@@ generation of their DNA .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is due to be in the government today and not in power , because the power of politics is broken down into the economy and the areas are separate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I mentioned my hair with capitalism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you think about it , it is like a herd of prey that is so sustainable the animals , from which it feeds on , that they are star@@ ved at the end . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; similar to the economy , that has become so far more can@@ ni@@ hil@@ ated by the self @-@ caused economic crisis , the power of corpor@@ ations is growing , the overall economic demand falls and the managing director of the corpor@@ ations are to be sc@@ ared to invest the cash of their companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the more successful capitalism exp@@ elled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; demos &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &#91; the people &#93; from democracy , the higher the twin summit , and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if this is true , it is obvious that we must bring together politics and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; demos &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; keeps control , as in antique Athens , apart from exclusion of slaves , women and fore@@ ig@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a new idea , by the way .
the Marxist Lin@@ ke had this idea 100 years ago and it was not very good .
the doctrine of the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working arms can reg@@ ain a position as in antique Athens without creating new species of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is a solution : creating the working poor !
capitalism is doing it by replacing low @-@ scale property by automation and robot .
the problem is so long economy and politics separate areas , the automation of the twin summit will be higher , the waste of waste , and the social conflicts deeper , as it -- already very soon as I think -- in countries such as China will come .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must re@@ shape the economy and unite the areas of economy and politics , and be sure to demo@@ cr@@ ise the re@@ united area , otherwise we end in a path@@ ological surveillance hyper@@ auto@@ cr@@ acy which leaves the film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a documentation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so the question is not whether capitalism is the technical achievements , which he brought forth , will survive --
&quot; &quot; &quot; the more interesting question is whether capitalism is similar in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; similar to the human being used in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Star Tre@@ k , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or by something which are putting human energy into the discovery of the universe , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ en@@ ians &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ag@@ ora , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in long talks the sense of life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think we must be optimistic .
so what would be like it could look like this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; novel utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; matrix &quot; -@@ like d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
in the practical implementation , I want to give you a few examples .
in the area of the company : ask a capital market in which you deserve money while you work and in which your capital will follow you from a job to next , and the company -- no matter what you are working -- is property of those who currently work in the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then all income from capital and from proceeds and the concept of wage labour is completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no distinction between those whose companies belong , but they do not work in it , and employees working there , but the company does not belong to whom the company does not belong to the company , and no major g@@ aps between investment and spare parts , and ultimately no emp@@ i@@ vers tw@@ ins .
in the area of global political economy , please briefly introduce that our national currencies would have a free exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , which is issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest emerging markets &#93; , which will be issued in the interests of all humanity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; imagine that the entire world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cos@@ mos &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- and each government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the trading surplus of the respective country , into a joint fund . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; imagine that this fund has invested in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes proposed in the Bre@@ t@@ ton W@@ oods Conference of 1944 .
the problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it .
today , we have them , especially in front of the back@@ drop of a re@@ united policy and economy .
the world that I describe you is the same time liber@@ ally , in which she pre@@ fers privileged persons , and mar@@ x@@ istic because they have buried the separation of capital and work in the tr@@ ash@@ can of history , and key@@ nes@@ ian , global key@@ nes@@ ian .
but above all , it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy .
we will wake up in such a world
or are we going to be into a &quot; Matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we decide to choose politically .
it is in our hands , and we do it better democratic .
thank you .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself in your biography as liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if anything of what I said just said , then Marx is relevant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and business is ... do we do that , technological development will generate a massive decline in the overall economic demand that Larry Sum@@ mers is called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; long term stag@@ nation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the transfer of this crisis of a part of the earth to the next , as we currently live it will not only dest@@ ab@@ ili@@ ze our demo@@ cra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is minimal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if this analysis is applicable , Marx is absolutely relevant ,
just like Hay@@ ek , that &apos;s why I &apos;m a liber@@ t@@ ine Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and that &apos;s why I am also perfect .
BG : in fact , and now we are too .
Y@@ V : if you &apos;re not wir@@ led , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosoph@@ ical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein , who said this . BG : in your presentation , you mentioned Singapore and China , and yesterday at the dinner of the Red@@ ner you have very clear what you are from the west point of view to China .
do you want to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there &apos;s a great measure of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies , we have the appearance of a democracy .
as I said in my presentation , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most of it plays , -- the area of the economy -- a completely democratic @-@ free zone .
in a certain sense when I can say that so pro@@ voc@@ ative , China re@@ sembles that today in the England of the 19th century .
because -- remember -- we tend to link liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is an error , historically considered .
liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , such as John Stu@@ art Mill --
he was particularly scep@@ tical what concerns the democratic development .
what can be observed in China is similar to the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
China is now trying to do what the West has done in the 19th century , smells of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I &apos;m sure that many list@@ eners are curious about your experiences as finance minister of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I found that coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back to the first half months later ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal view , and very disappoin@@ ting because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone ,
not only Greece , but the Eurozone ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; namely , to say goodbye to the self @-@ compl@@ ac@@ ity , and it persist@@ ed that a massive understanding line proce@@ eded by the euro@@ zone and continues to grow substantially in the development of the whole European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we had the opportunity , based on the Greek proposal , which was the first proposal to deny this den@@ ial --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , the powers in the Eurozone , within the European &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; continues to deny the den@@ ial . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know what comes .
this is the experience from the Soviet Union --
if you try to obtain an economic system , which is not vi@@ able to get out of life by political will and author militar@@ ism , it might have been able to carry out a while , but if the change happens , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and de@@ structive .
BG : what change is you ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the euro@@ zone has no future if we do not change their structure .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- serious juice ...
if there is a Minister for Finance , or any Minister , who claims that after 6 months in office , particularly in such a wor@@ rying situation , he claimed no mistakes , then it is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the extension of the debt programme by the end of February .
I believed that there was an hon@@ our@@ able interest on pages of the don@@ ors to find a common solution .
but that was not .
they only wanted to fall our government , just because they didn &apos;t want to deal with the dist@@ or@@ tions that ran through the euro@@ zone .
they didn &apos;t want to admit they had a cat@@ astroph@@ ic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
there &apos;s worse than during &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no one out of the Tro@@ ika of the directors who has imposed this policy on this policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This was an col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive t@@ ons of convers@@ ations , you seem to be still quite per @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone comes from anyone who lives and loves Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my greatest fear is that the euro@@ zone did not survive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for if they do not survive , they will be demon@@ ic , and destroy the European Union .
this will not have dis@@ astro@@ us consequences for Europe , but for the entire world economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we propos@@ e ourselves to the path of a post @-@ modern 1930 , what appears to me it will be as well as to the future of Europeans as well as non @-@ Europeans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : we really hope that you are wrong at this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you very much for you at TE@@ D .
Y@@ V : thank you .
most of them have never heard of Roy Price , although he probably is responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on 19 April 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining , but not very many of you .
that goes back to the decision , who met Roy three years ago .
Roy Price is an executive employee at Amazon Studios ,
the TV production company by Amazon .
he is 47 years old , slim , has an I@@ yel@@ low@@ ur and describes itself on Twitter as &quot; Movies , TV , Techn@@ ics , Tac@@ os . &quot;
Roy has a very important job , because he is responsible for the shows and content to produce the Amazon .
of course this is a very hard fighting industry .
there are so many TV series that Roy can &apos;t choose anything .
he must find shows very , very good .
in other words , he must find shows that are on the right on this bend .
this curve is the evaluation distribution of over 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the evaluation goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows received this review .
if your show is rated nine and above , this is a winner .
then one has a successful show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these are shows like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; breaking Bath , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- all the shows that are addic@@ ted when you saw a season , your brain asks : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where are there any more of these episodes ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that kind of show .
on the left , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- this should tell you enough what is going on at that end of the curve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roy Price doesn &apos;t care about the left side of the curve because I think you already need special intelligence for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he makes herself more thoughts about the average Aus@@ ul@@ ung , the average TV -- the shows , which are neither good nor bad , they simply do not inspire them .
so he must ensure that he really is on the right side .
the pressure is present , and of course it &apos;s also the first time Amazon so doing something , that &apos;s why Roy Price doesn &apos;t want to risk anything .
he wants to create success .
he needs guaranteed success , so he holds a competition .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and sel@@ ects eight candidates for TV shows , then he produced the first episode of each of these shows and introduces them online where they can watch them for free .
and if Amazon gives you anything for nothing , you &apos;re talking about , right ?
millions of viewers look at this episodes .
however , they do not know they are watching during watching this shows .
they are observed by Roy and his team that record all .
you can capture when to start the show when you are p@@ aus@@ ed , which parts are ski@@ pped or check once again .
you collect millions of data to decide with this data , which show they should produce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , they collect data , process and process the answer , and this reads : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com over four rep@@ ubli@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they made this show .
does anybody know the name of this show ?
yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show , because it was not so good .
it is just an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- as the average of this curve 7.4 is and Alpha House lan@@ det out at 7,5 -- a bit above average , but not just what Roy and his team worked .
about the same time at another company , another manager has pl@@ az@@ iert a top @-@ show by data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . exactly like Roy it is always searching for this a super show and he is also using data , but it makes it a different way .
instead of having a contest , he and his team looked at the existing data on the Net@@ fli@@ x viewer , so the reviews that they give the shows whose shows they like , etc .
then use this data to find out these little details about the audience : which shows they like , which producers , which actors .
when they had all the parts together they went a car and decided to do not a Sit@@ com over four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9,1 review on this bend . so exactly where they wanted to go .
of course the question is : what happened here ?
one has two very competent , data diversi@@ fied companies .
they connect these many data and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is that ?
because logic somehow says that it should work with everything .
if you collect millions of data , for a decision that meets , then you should make a good decision .
you have 200 years to statistics as back @-@ up .
it optimi@@ zes it by very powerful computer .
the min@@ de@@ ste you can expect is good TV , right ?
if data analysis is not working so , this is something terri@@ fying because we live in a time , in which we need more and more statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television .
does anybody know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
no one . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one ever comes in touch with this software . come in touch , you are in jail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if someone is in prison in the United States and for release , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dism@@ iss@@ al is done or not . &quot; &quot; &quot;
just like at Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of decide whether a show is good or bad will be decided whether a person will be good or bad .
medi@@ o@@ cr@@ e television , 22 minutes that can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results . that is not aware that a company like multi @-@ health system does not know how to use data .
the data reversible firms are also wrong .
yes , even Google does make mistakes .
in 2009 , Google announced that it is possible due to data analysis of flu , bad way , predic@@ tions -- by data analysis of Google &apos;s research .
it worked wonderfully and was a great news @-@ giving . the success was successful in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
it worked fine , year around year , until it suddenly didn &apos;t work anymore ,
and nobody could say why .
it just didn &apos;t work , this was again a sensation , including the withdrawal of the release in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
even the data is reversible firms such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
despite all these errors , data flows down in decisions of life -- at work , in law en@@ forcement , in medicine .
so , we should rather ensure that data is helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in the computer@@ ized genetics -- an area where some very clever people un@@ imagin@@ able many data to make serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or the development of a medication . over the years I recognized some samples by the difference between successful decisions and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you have to solve a complex problem , mainly do two things :
first , put this problem into its parts , so that you can analyse the individual parts ; as a second , you put the individual parts back together to hold a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : get apart and put together again .
and now the most important : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to break a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to add the parts again and then come to a decision .
there is another tool for this and we all have it : our brain .
if there is something in which the brain is good , it is parts and pieces back together , even if the information is incomplete , in order to hold a good decision -- especially if it &apos;s the brain of an expert .
therefore , I think was Net@@ fli@@ x so successful because they have used data and mind where they belong to the process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they use data to better understand their audience , why they wouldn &apos;t have been able to put together all these parts , and make it a show like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; House of Cards &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which does not stand in the data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , which meant that they entered a great personal risk of this decision .
Amazon on the other hand did this in the wrong way .
they used data to control all their decisions , first as they chose TV ideas , then called &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a secure decision because they could always say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they tell us the data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data is helpful for better choices , but I think things go wrong when data start to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data is only a tool , and around not to forget , this device is rather useful .
many of you will become ...
before there was data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using an Ja@@ - or No question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely &quot; -- exactly here at this moment .
I will try it later with a technical demo .
I have met some decisions in my life so far , I should have listened to the ball in the night .
but , as you know , of course , if you have the data available , you want to replace them by something much more sophisticated , such as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic structure .
maybe the ball will cla@@ p and cla@@ im@@ ers , and ultimately it is in us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right curve .
and I feel this as a very encour@@ aging message that , despite the great amount of data , it is still paying off to make decisions to be an expert in what you do , and risks .
because at the end , it is not the data but risks , with which you end up at the right end of the curve .
thank you nice .
