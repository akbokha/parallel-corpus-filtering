<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">Maybe you know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before someone had heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he spectacularly published that the NSA reportedly listened illegal telephones of Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But there is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">It describes a disastrous US intelligence operation, which gave the CIA literally drafts for a nuclear bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If that sounds crazy, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who did not like the chapter?</seg>
<seg id="9">The US government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For almost 10 years the government has chosen Risen and asked him to call his alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this turn, he became a symbol of the patterns of government, whistleblower, and to spy journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to First Constitutional Complaints, the media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right if media cannot get this information, and if they cannot protect identity of the Muammers, which they will cost.</seg>
<seg id="14">Thus, when the government went on to Risen, he did something that had told many courageous reporters already before him, he refused, and he said that he would rather go to prison.</seg>
<seg id="15">So from 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk to go to prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, just days before the process, something extraordinary happened.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "suddenly, though they had been vital for their case, the claims of the government were dropped to Risen." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the period of electronic monitoring, reporters and springs can always be concealed.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of failure and irritation to get statements, that could also do its digital footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigators, without having consent, calls himself secret his calls,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like his e-mail data, financial and bank information, its credit card, and even travel documents with the list of its flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of these information, they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, CIA-Whistleblower and cracks.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately, this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect Whistleblower. but instead, justice has condemned more than all U.S. governments in front of him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government is too much of their work as secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, almost every article about national security was the result that a whistleblower went to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">So we put the media on the game, which should be protected by the first constituency, because the government has more possibilities to exclude all.</seg>
<seg id="28">But just as technology of the government allowed to handle the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="29">And indeed, they can do that from the moment, in which they contact, instead of descending, in stuff.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today, it is a communication software that has not existed when Risen had written his book, and it is much safer to call ordinary e-mails or phone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such a technology is a SecureDrop, an open-source transfer system for whistleblower, which was originally developed by the website of Aaron Swartz, and is now published by the Freedom of the Press Foundation, where I have been working.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of send an e-mail, go to a news website, just as the Washington Post works.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send information as with any common contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These will then be encrypted and stored on a server, which only has access to the respective news agency.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government can no longer procure information, and many of the information they would like to request would not be available from beforehand.</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments develop new spy technologies around the world that endanger us all.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "it is possible to ensure that not only technology artists such as Edward Snowden have a possibility to give abnormalities. it is just as important that we protect the next whistleblower." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">"" "" "" "the troubles with the supply of soldiers complained and wants to report by overcrowded hospitals. or the next environmental workers, the alarm to the contaminated water of Flint. or a Wallstreet-Insider, who warned us before the next financial crisis." ""</seg>
<seg id="40">At least, these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crimes, but to protect ourselves from all constitutional rights.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on April 3, 2016, the largest data leck of history was published.] [the "Panama Papers" [What does that mean?] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness to be hidden.] This week we were asked by news about a Leck of 11 million documents of the Mossack Fonseca</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "we will get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers to companies such as Mossack Fonseca and say," "" "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you setup it?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see emails, the exchange of messages, how the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Islands Prime Minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that a ban of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has votives in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "it is claimed that a trace of 2 billion US dollars to Russia's President Vladimir Putin will lead to a close friend of children's days, a famous Cellists." ""</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of rich people and others who wait nervous for the next release, and on the next undiscovered documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">This sounds like the plot of a agent modem or a John-Grisham novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems, weep away from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we address this?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is, if the rich and powerful in the position are to hide their assets in tax havens, and do not pay all their taxes, then this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organisation, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">"" "" "" "in the whole world, media and leading politicians, such as secret tax havens are used by some few, to hide their assets and to send them -- something that we have been discussing and unveil." ""</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people seem very confusing this whole world, and it is hard to understand how this tax havens function.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine it like a Matrjoschkapsel.</seg>
<seg id="60">So you have a company in another company, in another company, what it is almost impossible to understand who is behind this building.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "it can be very difficult for prosecution and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what matters." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">I think it is also interesting that there are fewer reports about this matter in the US.</seg>
<seg id="63">Probably because there was no known Americans that previously appeared in these revelations to this scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it is not that there are not enough Americans to hide their assets in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">However, through the principle that this tax havens work, Mossack Fonseca has less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a data leck of the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, it is so that in some U.S. states there is less information you need to start a company than to get a library card.</seg>
<seg id="68">This type of intransparent in the US has allowed them to curb school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has been allowed to curb particularly vulnerable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covered investigator into the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator gave himself as an African minister, who wanted to bring back money to the USA to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">We really shocked us that all except for a lawyer asked our investigator how he could transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">These were all prediction. none of these lawyers took us as a client, and of course no one was handed over to anyone else. but it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this as a single failures.</seg>
<seg id="78">It's not about a individual lawyer, who has spread proposals for our hidden investigators.</seg>
<seg id="79">It's not about a single top pole, involved in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">It is about how the system works through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">And to cope with this, we must change the rules.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "we need to change the rules to make this sort of behavior difficult." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">This may sound very comforting as if we could do anything against it, as if nothing had ever changed, as if there will always be the rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a born optimist, I see quite a lot has begun to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">In the past few years, we have seen forward to more transparency, which concerns the owners of companies.</seg>
<seg id="86">The theme found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then the EU has been captures in central registers at national level, who is really behind companies in Europe and who controls it.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lagging behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties have inserted a bill in both parliamentary chambers, but this does not make progress we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how these Panama's revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, as a remedy is used to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for changes.</seg>
<seg id="92">"" "" "" "we need ordinary people who are furious when others see how other people can hide their true identity behind the headaches." ""</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "we need executives in the economy that rise up and say," "" "Intransparent is not good for business." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "we need leading politicians that recognize the problem and use it by law to stop this kind of intransparent." ""</seg>
<seg id="95">Together we can finally stop the intransparent, which is now possible to finish this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering.</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story, as I was almost kidnapped and in the trunk of a red Mazda would be.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after I finished my design studies, I made an adjoining sale.</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stayed and looked up my belongings.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a roadtrip through the whole country. afterwards he would go to the peace of peace.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "while we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him," "" "Where are you sleeping tonight?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">"" "he made the whole thing worse:" "" "I don't know yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought: "Oh, man!</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just got to know him! he says he would go to peace of peace, but I don't know if he really is planning it. I don't want to land away in the boot of a Mazda!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small boot!</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "then I heard myself:" "" "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "a voice in my head said," "" "How please?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">At night I was in bed, I stared at the ceiling, and thought, "Oh man! what was I broken up?</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild living sleeping in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy? "</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fear that I went out of the bed, at the toe of the door, and my sleep door shut down.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in touch with us.</seg>
<seg id="119">The work of art that he bought from me is today in his classroom. he is now teachers.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it has completely changed my viewpoint.</seg>
<seg id="121">Maybe people who were sold in childhood as strangers, actually friends who were waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">People at my air mattress was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mixture.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let's take a jump, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I'm jobless, almost pleite, pulling my roommate and the rent will be increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I knew there was a design conference in the city at that time. all hotels were booked out.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think creativity can make it be a lot of fun to transform.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky: "Brian, I overlay, how we could earn some time. our apartment is staying with us, Wi-Fi and a desk, including a mattress and every morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and established so "Ambimatratze and Breakfast" [AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep on wooden floor for 20 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it great, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">"" "" "" "I am sure our cheese ham Omelet tasted completely different because we made them for our guests." ""</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them all over the city. when we passed our last guest and fell the door to the castle, Brian and I started.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that at the same time we find new friends and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came to rolls.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former roommate, Nate Blecharist, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find whether to make it a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">We presented the investors: "we want to create a website which includes people public pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their baths -- the kind of rooms whose doors are coming when visiting.</seg>
<seg id="139">Over the Internet, they can then invite wild people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">That will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited for the missile would ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they do not act.</seg>
<seg id="143">No one, who is still quite consolation would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we all learned as children, strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If you have a problem, you get on things that can be good. we could design it.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Academy of Fine Arts we learned that design is much more than just look and feel - it is the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create an immense trust between people who had never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design be so special?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create confidence?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a tasting, what degree we trust.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30 seconds experiment. it will force you out of your compilation.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up if you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now, I'd like to lock you out your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Enter your locked mobile phone with your left seat.</seg>
<seg id="157">This quiet approach of panic that you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts will feel when they open the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">For the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your SMS, you can see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to keep the locked mobile phone of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most sense the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">That is how most guests feel when they stay elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Only times, who now has Al Gores's cell phone?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you please tell us on Twitter that he is the president of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the mobile phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I want to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we have changed a little detail about this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbour had imagined only with its name, when he had told what he comes from, like his dog, or his children?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you would have 150 respondents, they all say: "he can really hold very well locked phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when you had to return your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well-thought feedback system strengthens confidence.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we did some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was difficult for people to abandon negative charges.</seg>
<seg id="175">In the end, we decided to wait for both hosts and guests, before we ordered them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We examined a study with Stanford. we examined how likely it is that people trust one another, how much they are in terms of age and living.</seg>
<seg id="178">Little surprising, we trust the people most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social presumed.</seg>
<seg id="181">It will be exciting if you add the call of a person -- in our case by Beurgency.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have less than three notifications, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But if you have more than ten, everything changes.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation staffing commonalities.</seg>
<seg id="185">So the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">Moreover, we drove that trust is dependent on how much man can be found.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "if one tells too little, for example" "" "Hi!" "" "you get no answer." ""</seg>
<seg id="189">"" "one tells too much, such as:" "" "I have problems with my mother" "" -- -- the request is rather not accepted. "" "</seg>
<seg id="190">So there is an optimal level of openness, for example "Great art works in your home! I do with my family vacation."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can I create it with design to create this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips to which themes you should write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our entire company builds on hope that the right design can help, overcome our prejudices against strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we did not reckon was the great amount of people who were more than ready to place these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people take our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can recognize three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: incredibly good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Secondly: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third, a need that had not been covered before.</seg>
<seg id="200">The business is very good for us.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there are times if not everything goes smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have been allowed to celebrate parties or devastated apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts will have guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked on the customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I was standing at the forefront, when trust has been broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There's nothing worse than those calls. it's hurt when I remember.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment you hear in the voice of the caller, and will always be our greatest motivation to improve.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately only one fraction had a problem from the 123 million overnight stays.</seg>
<seg id="209">Because people confided to each other.</seg>
<seg id="210">When confidence works, there can be done miracles.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests did vacation in Uruguay. he suffered a heart attack there.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host was going to hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood to the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect house for travellers, which tend to heart attacks due to sitting activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with adequate hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels who save lives, even though they don't know it correctly.</seg>
<seg id="218">You drive one in your own car to the hospital when you die, and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want you feel lonely, they bring books over.</seg>
<seg id="220">You can stay a longer stay, without charge extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">Thus, of course, not every stay is starting.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I stumbled upon this term for the first time, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing with monetary transactions fit together?</seg>
<seg id="226">It's about an economic trading here.</seg>
<seg id="227">"" "but now it just simply" "" "tening industry" "" "is not just the case." ""</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People put a part of itself, and this changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">When you are traveling today, it is easy to compare with fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">What if travel would be a rich buffet would be from local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if in any place you have visited, a group would be waiting there to fill a thoroughly thoroughly and to show a Kneipentour neighborhood there, of which you have never heard;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays, flats are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would like to arrange apartments from the ground up to each other?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would this look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would have received the minds of common share?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities which allow us society and relations, instead of loneliness and isolation.</seg>
<seg id="239">In South Korea, Seoul, this project was already begun. lots of parking places belonging to the government,</seg>
<seg id="240">Residents are now offered to residents. students who were looking for a lead,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were delivered to people whose children were out. they were started incubators,</seg>
<seg id="242">In order to finance new start-ups in the Share Economy, night. over our platform alone will be 785 000 people in 191 countries at a stranger or even hosts.</seg>
<seg id="243">The idea seems to be not as crazy as it was taught us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We have not invented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality has been there before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were already similar websites before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did our work exactly?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from luck and timing, we realized that you can find the right design with the ingredients of confidence.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deeply rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I think it blossoms,</seg>
<seg id="251">Downright overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it whenever a red Mazda drives on me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We know, of course, that design cannot solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us, if it had this great influence, I wonder what we can use design for soon.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think when you watch me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A creditor? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or suppressed, brainwashed, undergoing a terrorist attack?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or just a delay in safety at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is actually true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I do not give you the blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">This is how the media represent people that look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study found that 80% of the coverage of Islam and Muslims are negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: the Americans mean, most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people do not speak with their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For all those who have never met a Muslims: it's great, you know.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee machine -- double espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted,</seg>
<seg id="271">A Möchteers-Fitness-fanatic,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practitiful, spiritual Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not like Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I was not born.</seg>
<seg id="274">"" "" "" "I decided to do so." ""</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17, I met my decision to outen me.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as homosexual man, as some of my friends, but as Muslims. I decided to bear the Hijab, my head cover.</seg>
<seg id="277">My feminist girlfriends were horrified: "why do you suppress yourself?"</seg>
<seg id="278">At that time, it was a feminist declaration of independence, which I felt as a 17-year old man felt like to adapt to a perfect and unattachable beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only accepted the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have to do with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="281">I read it, thought, questioned, doubted and believed.</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">She was trust and slow devotion which deepened itself with each reading of the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of rhythm brings me to tears sometimes.</seg>
<seg id="285">I recognize myself in it. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">Have you ever felt the feeling that someone you perceives you fully understands, and yet somehow loves?</seg>
<seg id="287">That's how it feels.</seg>
<seg id="288">Later I married and began, like all the good Egyptians, my career as a engineer.</seg>
<seg id="289">I had later, after my marriage, a child, and lived in the "Egyptian-American dream."</seg>
<seg id="290">Then came the terrible morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">"" "I sat in my kitchen, had breakfast at the end looked at the screen and saw the word" "" "rush message" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="293">There was smoke, planes flew in buildings, people jumped out of the buildings.</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disturbance?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock changed rapidly into indignation.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should we do something?</seg>
<seg id="299">""... "I switched to the TV channel and heard:" ""... "Muslim terrorists" ""... "..." ""... "in the name of Islam..." ""... "jihad..." ""... "..." ""</seg>
<seg id="300">Oh my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">"" "" "" "it is not only my country being attacked, but in Nu turned the deeds of others from a citizen in a suspect." ""</seg>
<seg id="302">That same day we had to drive through the Middle West in the USA to move into a new city and start with the postgraduate studies.</seg>
<seg id="303">I remember how I drove away -- as we were silent -- so deeply it went into my seat, and I was afraid to be recognized as Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="304">We moved to our apartment in this night, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">"" "and then I heard, and read, and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations, which said," "" "Be alert," "" "Stay in well lit areas," "" "Don't cherish you." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed for the whole week inside.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it was Friday in that week -- the day before Muslims gather to prayer.</seg>
<seg id="308">"" "and again the warnings:" "" "don't go on this first Friday, mosque could be a goal." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">"" "" "" "the feelings were understandably unfiltered and I heard of attacks in Muslims or people who were held for Muslims, thrown into the Free and defeated." ""</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really fire attacks on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something did not feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because the people who had attacked this country, have attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">"" "" "" "I have already swept the rage of people to terrorists." ""</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to declare yourself constantly.</seg>
<seg id="318">I have nothing about questions, I love questions.</seg>
<seg id="319">It is the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">Nowadays we can actually hear people say: "there is a problem in this country -- it's called Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we go? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to join Muslims and mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church as from a tumour in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">Only the question arises: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know: a malignant tumor is removed as a whole and a benign tumor, one sees only under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">Muslims are, like all other Americans, not a tumor in the body of the United States, but an essential organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, Saviour and Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="330">Is the closure of mosques of America safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">There might be a few parking spaces, but do not stop terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">Regular visiting of a mosque leads to people with other belief tolerant, and to show larger citizens.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as a leader of the police in the Washington region, DC recently told: people are actually not radicalised in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They will be radicalised in their cellar or in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">In the Radiation Process we noted that it begins online. as a first, the person is cut off by their family, that the person believes the terrorists are the true Muslims, and everyone who disguise the true Muslims, and of their ideology, is a traitor or by faith.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent radicalisation, we must stop the people to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group founded their brutality with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As a Muslim, mother, as a human being, I think we must do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add to their imagination, if you recognize it as a representative of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku-Klux-Klan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology on their "Holy Book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"" "but if you throw a look at them, she does not throw what they read in their" "" "Holy Scripture." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality, which they can read these things in Scripture.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam told me recently an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she had preceded to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">"" "he said," "" "the problem was just the opposite. every spirit that she spoke, brought them to silence, and told her that her anger was in the world to put her in trouble." ""</seg>
<seg id="350">Of nothing inspires and something that would have given their rage, it was a main goal for the instrumentalisation by extremists who spoke a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam set the connection to God and her church again.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of accuse them for their anger, he showed their constructive way for a real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">She learned what she learned in the mosque, so she kept to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">That was an insight as the Islamophobia concerned me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it work for each other?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day, on our mind freedom?</seg>
<seg id="358">A study -- actually several neuroscience studies -- show: if we fear, at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">We rather accept an authoritarian government system, conformity and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="360">A study shows: if you report test individuals, in which negatively about Muslims, they were rather military attacks on Muslim countries and the circumcision of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just a physical problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you look at the mood against Muslims upwards -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terror attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the advance of Iraq's war and two constancy periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Moslem terror as I expected it.</seg>
<seg id="365">"" "" "" "it can actually be a tool to manipulate the public in order to grind the foundation of a free society, sensible and well-informed citizens." ""</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is a early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We might feel it as the first, but the toxic air is scared of all of us.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the assignment of collective debt, it is not only about to explain himself.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina where both went to school.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was a sportsmen.</seg>
<seg id="371">He was at the dental clinic, talented, promising...</seg>
<seg id="372">His sister would say to me that he was the sweet, most generous person, whom she knew.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was stunned and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"when is such a young man coming out of my breasts?"</seg>
<seg id="375">Just a few weeks after the visit of Suzanne in her brother and his wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, she was murdered, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan, who had posted in the afternoon as in an execution after he posted outings against Muslims on his Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="376">He shot at Deah eight times.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanaticism can not only be immoral, but also fatal.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Are we gone to the mosque or did we stay safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">We beset it and for us it was not a light decision, for it was about whom America we want to leave our children: one that we can control our religion, or one in whom we can freely practise our religion.</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided for the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in the children's seat we drove to the mosque with high pressure.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took him out, and went out, and went out into the prayer hall, and what I saw, let me hold.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the Imam made an announcement, thanked and welcomed our guests, as the half of the gathered together were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers, and non-believers who had come to attack us, but to join us.</seg>
<seg id="387">At that moment I went together.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had courage and condolences and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose in the moment of fear and fanatism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you be sure to go safe?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you connect to those who think: we are better than those.</seg>
<seg id="393">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thank you nice!</seg>
<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have hit a nerve.</seg>
<seg id="396">But I wonder what you say, perhaps you say that you have a TEDTalk, a thought to work with deep thinking, so an exception and not the rule are.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">Dalia Mogahed: I would say, do not be deceiving. I'm completely normal.</seg>
<seg id="399">I am no exception.</seg>
<seg id="400">My story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="401">I am as usual as it is allowed.</seg>
<seg id="402">If you look at Muslims around the world, and I did that with the biggest ever carried out study on Muslims around the world, people want normal things.</seg>
<seg id="403">They want prosperity for the family, they want work and they want to live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So I am an exception in no regard.</seg>
<seg id="405">If humans appear as a rule, usually the rule has been broken, and they are not the exception to rule.</seg>
<seg id="406">HW: thank you very much. Dalia Mogahed.</seg>
<seg id="407">What started as a platform for Basters, a billion dollar store is about to be reached.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drones. made possible in research institutions worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before air purification has entered our social consciousness, a autonomous fleet of flying machines in the FRAC Centre in France have built a six-metre-high tower from 1 500 bricks. some years ago, they began to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">Connect devices high speed and acceleration to the closest space.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build self-fledged structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to carry loads to deal with turbulence and react generally to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to exceed the limits of possible flight in autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">Thus a system works autonomously, it must know collectively what the mobile objects are located in the room.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at ETH Zurich, we often use external cameras to find objects. that allows us to focus on rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos, we use a new location technology of Verity Studios, a branch of our laboratories.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each flight machine has internal sensors to determine position in space, determine calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">External commands are on top eblee. g. "start" and "land" land.</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called rear starter,</seg>
<seg id="422">A pilot device, which tries to strike two flying with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other Starrhikers, it is efficient in reverse flight, much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">In contrast to most Starrots it can float, and has great advantages with start and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always a sweeping side.</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of tailstarters is that they react sensitively to turbulence like wind gusts.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the airship doesn't matter in which position the optimal location can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay. OK.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research, we often introduce basic abstract issues that penetrate to the core of the issue.</seg>
<seg id="431">Such a question would be: what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for doing the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">There are helicopters for example, known as machines with a thousand moving parts that accumulate to you.</seg>
<seg id="434">In decades ago, pilot controlled pilots could fly remote controlled machines, which had only two movable parts: a propeller and a tailgate.</seg>
<seg id="435">Not long ago we discovered that flying is working with only one.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the monster inner, the mechanest simplest flying device. it was invented recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only a moving part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No clarions, hinges and transitions, no further actuator or control surfaces, only one propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanically simple, it happens very much in the interiors, so that it can fly stable and move to the room.</seg>
<seg id="440">Nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the tailgate. to bring it to flying, I have to put it right.</seg>
<seg id="441">The likelihood of throwing it right, if you look at all, is small, so I'll show you a video that was filmed last night.</seg>
<seg id="442">If the monospinner is a practice in pleasantly, this machine is here, the Omnikopter with his eight propellers, a exercise in excess.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this excess?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is only symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">Therefore, he is ambivalent in his alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">Thereby he receives the auspacy capability,</seg>
<seg id="447">Moving in space in all directions, no matter what direction he rotates or even rotated.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course, it is complex, mainly in the field of interactive rivers from eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">Some can be set in models, the rest is learned directly when flying.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let us see that.</seg>
<seg id="451">If air machines have to be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine consists of two separate two-propeller machines.</seg>
<seg id="453">These rotates clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the others against the clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When you build it, they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">If anything goes wrong -- a motor or propeller is falling, the electronics or a battery -- can fly the machine even if limited.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will demonstrate that, by making a half airworthy.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration examines synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units enables a range of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took standard micro-quadcopter -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equips them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where in space it is and is self-controlled. therefore there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully, you will motivate these demonstrations to rethink new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The especially safe machine there would like to be a flying lampshade on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us lies the salary in the development and the creation act.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a memory, wonderful and enchanting our universe, and that there are creative, smart creatures allowed to form them in a spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the bag on the i.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="469">1.3 billion years ago circling in a very far away galaxy two black holes are increasingly quicker, they walked as the mass thirsts in pure energy in a tenths of pure energy.</seg>
<seg id="470">This short moment she lit brighter than all the stars together in all the galaxies of the entire universe.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">Her energy did not replace them in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was delivered into space-time-create and the universe exploded in gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">We arrange the events at first time.</seg>
<seg id="476">1.3 billion years ago was just a majority life on earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then the earth has resulted in a lot: corals, fish, plants, Saurier, people and -- God stand up to -- even the internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago a group of particularly courageous -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Turver from Caltech -- had a huge laser detector to look for gravitational waves, which are caused by colliant black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them held them crazy for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized them as crazy geniuses so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, design, design and extremely much more hard work they built the detector Ligo: the laser interferometer- Gravitational Observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the following time, the precision of Ligo was significantly increased, which improved the recognition performance enormously.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore you call it Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">Beginning of September 2015, Ligo was launched for a last attempt to clarify some small, stubborn problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On 14 September 2015, only a few days after commissioning of the detector, the gravitational waves routed the two colliding black holes across the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the parting of my death father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically, they were the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">All that I had worked for is no longer Science Fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he studied Gravitational waves from black holes and their through observatory like Ligo measurable signals. but what are gravitational waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a housing in the structure of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">By passing the wave, the space and its whole content will be stretched in one direction and the other is stretched.</seg>
<seg id="495">To illustrate lecturers in courses for the theory of relativity is often a true dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretch and dusty, stretch and dusty."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravity shafts are extremely weak, even ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On September 14, for instance, each one of us was stretched out in the wake of the waves. the stretch of an average man was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">That means 20 zeros after the comma, followed by a 1. therefore, one stated the Ligo staff for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five-kilometre laser detector, and that's already absurd, this length should be exactly measured in less than a thousandal of a nuclear power radius. that's grotesque.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classical text about gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">Described Kip Thorne, a co-founder LIGOs, the hunt for the waves as follows: "the technical difficulties when building such detectors are huge.</seg>
<seg id="503">But physicists are financially and with the support of the public, all obstacles will be overcome. "</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott claims that Ligo is more an ear than one eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I'd like to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength that is much smaller than things around us: facial features, the size of your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite practical. because so you can make a picture or map of things by taking the light around you around.</seg>
<seg id="509">In tones this is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">This is why it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean you particularly much:</seg>
<seg id="512">About the face of your child.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead we listen to specific properties like audio and height, rhythm and volume to close the story behind.</seg>
<seg id="514">"I'm talking about Alice."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob interrupts them."</seg>
<seg id="516">"dummer Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We can't make any simple images of objects in all with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by doing changes in amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least the measured frequencies are in the audible area.</seg>
<seg id="521">So if we convert waves to sound, we can literally listen to all.</seg>
<seg id="522">To listen to the gravitation, he can tell us about the collision of two black holes so that my colleague Scott has already been busy.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, non-rotating holes, it's simple: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">Spin the two bodies very fast, you hear the same circuit with an additional sound change. that sounds like: Wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu!</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of movement vocabulary, stamped in the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on 14 September 2015 -- a date that at least I never forget -- Ligo heard the following: [Surrender of the sound] Janybody who knows what he must hear, recognize this as sound of -- SH:... two black holes each with 30 times sun mass, which revolve around as fast as the rods of your Mixers.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let us consider what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the dichest body in all, one with a mass of 29 probes, the other with a mass of 36 suns, each other three times a second, before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know this because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the permanent importance of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo is a whole new way to investigate the universe as it never was possible.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way we can listen to all things and hear the visible.</seg>
<seg id="535">We can't see much in all -- practically or basically -- not.</seg>
<seg id="536">A Supernova, for example. I would like to know why masserolks explode stars in super novae.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. of them we have learned much about this.</seg>
<seg id="538">The exciting physical processes will occur at the core, which is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see, as these opak are.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitational waves penetrate iron, as it would be transparent glass. I would love to explore the first few minutes of the universe, but we'll never see it, since the urine is obscured by his own offspring.</seg>
<seg id="541">Using gravitational waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And most importantly: I am optimistic that we have never seen in all things we have never seen, and of whom we have never seen. things we can only discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact, Ligo found things straight in the first attempt, which we did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says to this topic: me: the type of stars, which create black holes, are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient body from prehistoric times. the black holes are so to speak for our archeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">Ligo allows us to view a completely different perspective on the events of all, on the emergence of the stars and ultimately, as we went out of this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge now exists to be as bold as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to Ligo, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatory -- a brand new generation of observatory on Earth and in all.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than to listen to the urine itself?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Do you dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time I tried an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"" "one year I would say to everything" "" "Yes!" "" "I feared that I was afraid." ""</seg>
<seg id="556">"" "it doesn't matter if it was nervous to me in unpleasant situations, I forced me to say" "" "Yes" "". "" ""</seg>

<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Did I want to play with the acting?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, yes yes yes. yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: exactly that which I feared, I feared my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear to keep talking, my social fear -- puff, gone.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes, my life has changed.</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes" changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain fact that my life changed deeply, unexpectedly. it began with a question of my young ones.</seg>
<seg id="569">I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the youngest, calls out of inexplicable reasons all the "sweets,"</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she was a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"sweets, I need milk for my beak money."</seg>
<seg id="572">She once asked me if I could play with her, when I was just on the jump. and I said, "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="573">This Yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new setting of life in my family. from then on I swam to play with them. no matter what I'm doing, or where I go, I say always Yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I'm not perfect, but I am very busy.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magic effect on me, my children, on our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has an intriguing side effect: actually I fully understood that "Yes" -Sagen to play with my children my career saved.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am an author. I think of things, awake for life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I create TV. I produce TV.</seg>
<seg id="585">I do TV, in a big style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season I am responsible to carry out 70 hours of program into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV programs, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are in production simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="588">Each shipment provides hundreds of jobs that did not exist.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a television station can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let us say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode all nine days, four TV programs, four TV programs, 70 hours TV, three broadcasts, which are simultaneously in production, four, 16 episodes: scandal, 15 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours TV,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my televisions run one another on Thursday night.</seg>
<seg id="594">Around the world, my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV hours are Shows, which I created myself, and not only produced, so I have to find time, really quiet, creative time to gather my fans of the campfire and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four TV series, 70 hours television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires that are burning around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who else does it?</seg>
<seg id="598">Nobody, that's why I'm a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>

<seg id="603">It's all a job, all work, everything reality, everything blood -- not tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work a lot, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">If I have deepened the work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">It is when I set troops on, as I painted on a screen.</seg>
<seg id="608">So as pregnant, one has a high tone, depth a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all this at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">It is creative, mechanical, exhausting and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, cruel and maternal, cruel and reasonable. and the best of it is the sum.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when working is going well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A sums starts in my head, and it grows and grows, and the sums sounds like a busy road, I could drive forever.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people assume if I explain the sums that I write about writing that writing to me is joy.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't understand me wrong, it does.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the sums -- when I began to work and work with the TV production, when I began to work and work, establish, create and cooperate, I discovered this thing, this sum, this energy. the sums!</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sum is action and activity. the sum of sums is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The sum of music is music. the sums is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The sums is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a sums, you can't strive differently than size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling of being unable to strive for size, no matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is what you call the sums.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it means to be a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it's called genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Maybe it's ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Maybe it's the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I only know that I did not fail for failure, and I just know that I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="631">I just want to tell you, I'm a Titan, and I know I don't want to ask.</seg>
<seg id="632">To make a clear one: the more successful I get, the more episodes, the more work there, the more things at the same time, the more things the same time, the more I write history, the more expectations there are.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more I have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="636">The country I create, the marathon, whom I run, the army, the high clay, the sums, the sums, the sums.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this sum. I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I am the sums.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this sums?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">Revised, exaggerated, exaggerated, burnt out.</seg>
<seg id="642">The sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth, that her mommy is a single working title.</seg>
<seg id="644">"" "Harper tells people:" "" "my mommy will not be there, but you can write my Nanny." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="645">And Emerson says, "Evaluate, I want to go to Shonda land."</seg>
<seg id="646">They are the children of a Titanen.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are baby-Titanen.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1 when the sums heard.</seg>
<seg id="649">The sums of the engine stopped.</seg>
<seg id="650">I did not love my work anymore. the engine was off.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My sums was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I made the same things as always: the same Titanen-Work, 15-Hour-Days, executed weekends, no regret, a Titan sleeps not, does not exist with all my heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no Summa.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me, silence was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four television programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was an indication of the Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was grey, I just didn't have fun anymore.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the sums and the sums was me.</seg>

<seg id="665">"" "I know some people like to think:" "" "grasp yourself, stupid author Titan." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know you are doing it, you are working, you do, one loves to be a teacher, a painter, Bill Gates, you just love one another, and that gives the sum of the sum if you ever knew the sums, if you stop the sums, who is then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>

<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is outstanding because my pain and panic, in solitude and lack of summens, I cannot do anything except match.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">The country I create, the marathon, whom I run, the army, the screen, the high clay - they don't exist anymore.</seg>
<seg id="687">Everything that exists are sticky fingers and moist kisses, delicate voices, wax crayons and the song in which it goes to let it go, or whatever the girl in "The Iron Queen."</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so scarce that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Play is the opposite of work.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes on and an energy lift comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that's not right, but it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums come back slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, barely there, it's quiet, hardly audible, but it's there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the sum, but a sums.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I would know a magical mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay in the case.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is Love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we've forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The sums, the working sums, the Titanensum, that is only the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, if I'm using broadcast and TV hours and how working my brain is, then I forgot what the real sums is.</seg>
<seg id="707">The sum of sums is no power and it is not working specifically.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real sums depends on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The sums is the river, which comes from the vitality of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">Genuine sums is self-awareness and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">Genuine sums ignored the pressure of history, which are to experience diligence, expectation and pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real sums is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real sums is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered to me the false words, for which God told me that I am a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a little more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">As soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say Yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I do this as a rule, so I can free myself from any guilt as a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is law, I have no other choice. I have no other choice if I want to hear the sums again.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good at games, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">Play is not ansatorial for me, how to work.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth hurts,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like it to play.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work, because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I am better at work than at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This concession is painful, because what a man is working rather than to house?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, I think.</seg>
<seg id="728">Be honest, I call myself "Titan" --</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I'm too relaxed, none of them is.</seg>
<seg id="731">We rasen around in the garden, before and back, and forth.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst into soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">I feel mainly stiff, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always gust according to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how to live, and the sum of the universe meets me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why did we stop playing with playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">They can do it too! they always say Yes, if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Maybe you'll keep me naive for a daydream.</seg>
<seg id="742">You are right, but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? they are not Rihanna or a Muppet Show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child finds you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">There are only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play at most 15 minutes with me until they conclude that they want to make something different.</seg>
<seg id="748">It's wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes, a ladybug or biscuit replaced me.</seg>
<seg id="750">And my teenage daughter speaks for 15 minutes with me, I am the mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">There are only 15 minutes, there's no need for more.</seg>
<seg id="752">Each one can bring about 15 minutes, even on a bad mood!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes a piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">No mobile phone, no laundry, no distraction.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, the children begged.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are inside!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my delight, my world. you don't have to be the children. it is true to feel the sums to have a place for his peace of peace.</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not about playing with their own children. it's about joy,</seg>
<seg id="759">To "Play" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself to 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what doing well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out and keep it.</seg>
<seg id="763">I'm not perfect in it. I thwart and I won. friends meet, read books, enjoy the day --</seg>
<seg id="764">"do you want to play?" it's just for everything I quit when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in the training when I wanted to surpass myself more and more.</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes on the piece, why not allow full 15 minutes to allow yourself?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong about it? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The sums came back in my spare time. sums seems to return when I'm not working.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working doesn't work without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months, a door, the energy flows in and I find myself in my office. I hear an unknown melody, it fulfills me and my soul. I am looking forward to new ideas. I use it into full trains and love my work again.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the sums, but I don't love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I am not the sums that sums is not me... no more.</seg>
<seg id="773">Soap bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">This is my Summa.</seg>
<seg id="775">The sum of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The sum of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">The sum of work is part of me, but just a part. and so I am so grateful.</seg>
<seg id="778">It is me to sniff me that I have a Titan. I have never seen a Titan, the trip to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">"" "I said" "" "Yes to less work and more games." ""</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything in hand. my brain is still working. my bonfires are still burning.</seg>

<seg id="782">The more I play, the more I feel like a good mother.</seg>
<seg id="783">The more I play, the clearer is my head.</seg>
<seg id="784">The more I play, the better I work.</seg>
<seg id="785">The more I play, the more I hear the sums. the country I can run, the marathon, whom I run, the clocks, the swmen, the sum, the sum, the sum, the sum of the sum, the sum of life.</seg>
<seg id="786">The more I feel this sums, the more this unusual, beating, naked, and new feeling of life in me wide. less Titan -- more I!</seg>
<seg id="787">The more I feel this sums, the more I know who I am.</seg>
<seg id="788">I am an author. I think of things, I awake for life.</seg>
<seg id="789">It belongs to the job, which means to live his dream.</seg>
<seg id="790">This is the dream of this job,</seg>

<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you nice.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am Neurosurgical.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human tragedies.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to another, after a serious stroke or an automobile accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">It is very frustrating for us, that the brain, unlike other bodily organs, has a very low ability to self-healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">Patients often have a lasting, severe disability after a severe injury to the central nervous system.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I became functional neurosurgery.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor, who tries to improve the nerve function by various surgical measures.</seg>
<seg id="804">Sure, they have heard of one of the most famous, "Tiepolhirnstimulation." thereby we implanted a electrode deep in the brain to influence the circuits of neurons so that the neurological function improved.</seg>
<seg id="805">It really is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson, who suffered severe trembling and heavy pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation however does not mean neuro healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream functional Neurosurgeon is the restoring of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion, we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I'd like to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help, the brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was a senior Consultant and worked day and night in the emergency room.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I supply patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">You must imagine that the brain is inclined at the brain-brain trauma and inclined the cranial pressure.</seg>
<seg id="815">To save life, one must reduce the cranking pressure.</seg>
<seg id="816">Sometimes you need to remove a part of a swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of throwing the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist, the brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by this?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not a easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">To ferment cells from a rifle is comparable to very small children who will be out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You have to find the proper nutrition, temperature, moisture and the environments to thrive them flourish.</seg>
<seg id="823">That's exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts there was Jean François.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw this under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked like a tribal culture. with large green cells surrounded by small, unripe cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you still know of the biological classes that stem cells are unripe, which can transform into any cellular type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niche of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this kind of stem cells from the surface mass of the brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very fast.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells were different.</seg>
<seg id="835">They split slowly, and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">So we saw a new, strange cellular population, who looked like stem cells, but behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand from where they came.</seg>
<seg id="838">They originate from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">You make 4% of our cerebral cortex.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the stage of the fetus, they ensure the cause of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why are they staying with us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know this.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they are taking part in healing the brain since we find it in higher concentrations close to brain injuries.</seg>
<seg id="847">This is not so sure.</seg>
<seg id="848">But one thing is clear -- of these cells we got our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We are facing a potential cell source that allows brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to remove a piece of brain mass from the non-linguistic area and then the cells are just that cultured as Jean-François did.</seg>
<seg id="853">And then mark them in colour to track them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step, we planned it to the customization of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous Transplantation -- Autotrantransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we plan to plan these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we planned the same cells in damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we could work with monkey.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario we planned the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that they were taken up after a few weeks, they would go back home. the room is already occupied, so they are not needed, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we added a violation and so we planned the same cells and now the cells were obtained -- they grew up to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells, which have not been planned.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence that they show are these small points. these are the cells that we in vitro, coloured in the culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">Of course we could not stop.</seg>
<seg id="864">Can these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual skill task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take food pellets with a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They did that very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they reached a stable skill level, we climbed the motorized cortex.</seg>
<seg id="869">Afterwards, the monkeys were paralyzed, they couldn't move their hand anymore.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen in people, they recreated spontaneously to a certain degree, just like a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">The patients are paralyzed and then try to recover themselves with the help of plastic brains. they relax at some degree, just as in the monkey.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were sure that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left you see the monkeys that caught spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can bring about 40% to 50% of its original performance from the violation.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not as precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Now you see when we planned the cells, the same monkey, two months after the herplantation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that were very exciting results for us too.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time, we have found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them and later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use them in other neuropathological models, for instance at Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to imitate them in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I can show you soon as the human brain gives the means to heal itself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="884">Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure that now, several dozen people in the audience, perhaps even the majority, think: "I know someone who can need this."</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely come.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question is what are the biggest obstacles before you start clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results you have to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to pass these kinds of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: that is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yes, but it needs a long time, a lot of patience and a almost professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look into the future -- you have completed research and tried permission to start clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it will take until someone can come to the hospital, and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's difficult to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First it depends on the approval of the clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will it allow us to launch it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to select patients who make treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">Then you have to apply this to a multicentre study.</seg>
<seg id="897">You must first prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you have told us about it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thanks a lot.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider it as of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">"" "" "" "we don't see democracy as the fragile plant which it is in reality but as a inventory of our society." ""</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider it as immutable awareness.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">That is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his big nightmare in Beijing have doubtless demonstrated that it is possible to have a blooming capitalism and impressive growth while the policy is completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">"" "" "" "in fact, democracy comes with us, in Europe." ""</seg>
<seg id="909">Beginning of the year when I rerepresented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was declared to me as finance minister in the Eurogroup, that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- not to affect the austerity programs that were realized in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At this moment, I thought that there would be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my sincere friends who asked me that democracy would be abolished if it would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to introduce an economic model for a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">"" "" "" "I pray you, together with me, believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup of a mistake, we could save democracy, but that we need a true and defentive democracy." ""</seg>
<seg id="913">"" "" "" "for without democracy our societies are united, our future gloomy and our great new technologies are wasted." ""</seg>
<seg id="914">In the topic of waste I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction, the currently our economies are threatened.</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the "twin summit paradox."</seg>
<seg id="916">One top is known to you. you know and recognize it as the debt mountain, who casts its long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the debt mountain,</seg>
<seg id="918">But only a few recognize his Didymus.</seg>
<seg id="919">"" "" "" "a mountain of unused cash which is to be anxious to invest it there where it would be productive and income, with whom it could produce the debt mountain and also produce all the things that humanity urgently needs, for example" "" "green" "" "energy." ""</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">In the past 3 months, in the United States, in England and in the Eurozone, 3.4 trillion dollars were invested in all the wealth of producing goods such as industrial buildings, machines, office buildings, schools, streets, tracks, equipment, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="922">3.4 billion US dollars a lot of money that is comparing to $5.1 billion US dollars, which were around the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing did, except the exchanges to blow up and raised real estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">"" "" "" "thus, debts and unproductive capital form the twin summit that do not compensate themselves by the usual market mechanisms." ""</seg>
<seg id="924">"" "" "" "the result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-olds intensifying, and consequently a low total demand for investors, which would not be investing in a low demand that it would not be true." "" "just like Ödipus Father, of fear, prophecy that his son would kill him if he will grow up." ""</seg>
<seg id="925">Unintentionally, the circumstances brought forth that Ödipus kills him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my hair with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"" "his extremely weathic art. all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives and improve our lives and especially all the technologies," "" "green" "" "technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth." ""</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we continue, what do we understand about democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as a corporate form, in which the free and the poor as a majority control the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian democracy, of course, ended too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigner, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">However, there would be a mistake to reduce the job value of Athenian democracy because of these inclusions.</seg>
<seg id="934">"" "" "" "the ruling on the Athenian democracy was and is that she gave them the working poor, but not only the right to freedom of expression, but important and crucial for them to agree to them the right to political participation with equal tuning in questions of statute." ""</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy did not hold long ago --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle, which shines very bright, it is also burned out quickly.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, our liberal democratic democracies do not have their roots in antique Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the Athenian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which ultimately was a statute for rulers.</seg>
<seg id="940">"" "" "" "for the liberal democracy was only possible when a complete separation of politics and economy was only possible, while the economy -- so the world of corporations -- a" "" "democracy-free zone" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="941">"" "" "" "in today's democracies, since the time of this separation of politics and business began, an unitary struggle between the two and the economy gradually migrates to politics." ""</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you wonder why the politicians do not know more like earlier?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not on a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">"" "" "" "it is due to be in the government today and not in power, because the power of politics is broken down into the economy and the areas are separate." ""</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hair with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">"" "if you think about it, it is like a herd of prey that is so sustainable the animals, from which it feeds on, that they are starved at the end." ""</seg>
<seg id="947">"" "" "" "similar to the economy, that has become so far more cannihilated by the self-caused economic crisis, the power of corporations is growing, the overall economic demand falls and the managing director of the corporations are to be scared to invest the cash of their companies." ""</seg>
<seg id="948">"" "the more successful capitalism expelled" "" "demos" "" "[the people] from democracy, the higher the twin summit, and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of humanity." ""</seg>
<seg id="949">"" "if this is true, it is obvious that we must bring together politics and the economy, and it would be better if the" "" "demos" "" "keeps control, as in antique Athens, apart from exclusion of slaves, women and foreigner." ""</seg>
<seg id="950">This is not a new idea, by the way.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist Linke had this idea 100 years ago and it was not very good.</seg>
<seg id="952">The doctrine of the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working arms can regain a position as in antique Athens without creating new species of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: creating the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism is doing it by replacing low-scale property by automation and robot.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is so long economy and politics separate areas, the automation of the twin summit will be higher, the waste of waste, and the social conflicts deeper, as it -- already very soon as I think -- in countries such as China will come.</seg>
<seg id="956">"" "" "" "we must reshape the economy and unite the areas of economy and politics, and be sure to democrise the reunited area, otherwise we end in a pathological surveillance hyperautocracy which leaves the film" "" "matrix" "" "as a documentation." ""</seg>
<seg id="957">So the question is not whether capitalism is the technical achievements, which he brought forth, will survive --</seg>
<seg id="958">"" "the more interesting question is whether capitalism is similar in" "" "matrix" "", "similar to the human being used in" "" "Star Trek," "" "or by something which are putting human energy into the discovery of the universe, or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians" "" "Agora," "" "in long talks the sense of life." ""</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would be like it could look like this "Star Trek" novel utopia instead of the "matrix" -like dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">In the practical implementation, I want to give you a few examples.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the area of the company: ask a capital market in which you deserve money while you work and in which your capital will follow you from a job to next, and the company -- no matter what you are working -- is property of those who currently work in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">"" "" "" "then all income from capital and from proceeds and the concept of wage labour is completely overhauled." ""</seg>
<seg id="964">No distinction between those whose companies belong, but they do not work in it, and employees working there, but the company does not belong to whom the company does not belong to the company, and no major gaps between investment and spare parts, and ultimately no empivers twins.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the area of global political economy, please briefly introduce that our national currencies would have a free exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, which is issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest emerging markets], which will be issued in the interests of all humanity.</seg>
<seg id="966">"" "imagine that the entire world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it" "" "cosmos" "" "-- and each government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the trading surplus of the respective country, into a joint fund." ""</seg>
<seg id="967">"" "imagine that this fund has invested in" "" "green" "" "technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare." ""</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today, we have them, especially in front of the backdrop of a reunited policy and economy.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world that I describe you is the same time liberally, in which she prefers privileged persons, and marxistic because they have buried the separation of capital and work in the trashcan of history, and keynesian, global keynesian.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all, it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">We will wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or are we going to be into a "Matrix" - similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide to choose politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands, and we do it better democratic.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself in your biography as libertarian Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if anything of what I said just said, then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">"" "" "" "the reason for the reunification of politics and business is... do we do that, technological development will generate a massive decline in the overall economic demand that Larry Summers is called" "" "long term stagnation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="984">"" "" "" "due to the transfer of this crisis of a part of the earth to the next, as we currently live it will not only destabilize our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is minimal." ""</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is applicable, Marx is absolutely relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">Just like Hayek, that's why I'm a libertine Marxist, and like Keynes, and that's why I am also perfect.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: in fact, and now we are too.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you're not wirled, you don't think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein, who said this. BG: in your presentation, you mentioned Singapore and China, and yesterday at the dinner of the Redner you have very clear what you are from the west point of view to China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Do you want to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there's a great measure of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies, we have the appearance of a democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my presentation, we have limited democracy to politics, while the area where most of it plays, -- the area of the economy -- a completely democratic-free zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In a certain sense when I can say that so provocative, China resembles that today in the England of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">Because -- remember -- we tend to link liberalism with democracy -- this is an error, historically considered.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, Liberals, such as John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly sceptical what concerns the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What can be observed in China is similar to the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">China is now trying to do what the West has done in the 19th century, smells of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I'm sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as finance minister of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I found that coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back to the first half months later?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from personal view, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece, but the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">"" "" "" "namely, to say goodbye to the self-complacity, and it persisted that a massive understanding line proceeded by the eurozone and continues to grow substantially in the development of the whole European Union." ""</seg>
<seg id="1007">We had the opportunity, based on the Greek proposal, which was the first proposal to deny this denial --</seg>
<seg id="1008">"" "" "" "unfortunately, the powers in the Eurozone, within the European" "" "Europe" "", "continues to deny the denial." ""</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what comes.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience from the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If you try to obtain an economic system, which is not viable to get out of life by political will and author militarism, it might have been able to carry out a while, but if the change happens, it happens abruptly and destructive.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what change is you ahead?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future if we do not change their structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistakes in your time as finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back -- serious juice...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a Minister for Finance, or any Minister, who claims that after 6 months in office, particularly in such a worrying situation, he claimed no mistakes, then it is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake was to sign the extension of the debt programme by the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honourable interest on pages of the donors to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that was not.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They only wanted to fall our government, just because they didn't want to deal with the distortions that ran through the eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They didn't want to admit they had a catastrophic program in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost a third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">There's worse than during "Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="1026">"" "no one out of the Troika of the directors who has imposed this policy on this policy," "" "This was an colossal mistake." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1027">BG: despite all this, and despite the aggressive tons of conversations, you seem to be still quite per-European.</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">"" "" "" "my criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone comes from anyone who lives and loves Europe." ""</seg>
<seg id="1030">"" "" "" "my greatest fear is that the eurozone did not survive." ""</seg>

<seg id="1036">Yanis, thank you very much for you at TED.</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1038">Most of them have never heard of Roy Price, although he probably is responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on 19 April 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining, but not very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">That goes back to the decision, who met Roy three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is an executive employee at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company by Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">He is 47 years old, slim, has an Iyellowur and describes itself on Twitter as "Movies, TV, Technics, Tacos."</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job, because he is responsible for the shows and content to produce the Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course this is a very hard fighting industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV series that Roy can't choose anything.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He must find shows very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he must find shows that are on the right on this bend.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the evaluation distribution of over 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the evaluation goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows received this review.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is rated nine and above, this is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then one has a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"" "these are shows like" "" "breaking Bath," "" "Game of Thrones," "" "The Wire" "" "-- all the shows that are addicted when you saw a season, your brain asks:" "" "where are there any more of these episodes?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1053">That kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">On the left, here at this end, shows like "Toddlers and Tiaras" -- -- this should tell you enough what is going on at that end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1055">"" "Roy Price doesn't care about the left side of the curve because I think you already need special intelligence for" "" "Toddlers and Tiaras" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1056">He makes herself more thoughts about the average Ausulung, the average TV -- the shows, which are neither good nor bad, they simply do not inspire them.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must ensure that he really is on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is present, and of course it's also the first time Amazon so doing something, that's why Roy Price doesn't want to risk anything.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create success.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs guaranteed success, so he holds a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes many ideas for TV shows and selects eight candidates for TV shows, then he produced the first episode of each of these shows and introduces them online where they can watch them for free.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon gives you anything for nothing, you're talking about, right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers look at this episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they do not know they are watching during watching this shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are observed by Roy and his team that record all.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You can capture when to start the show when you are paused, which parts are skipped or check once again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">You collect millions of data to decide with this data, which show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"" "in fact, they collect data, process and process the answer, and this reads:" "" "Amazon should make a Sitcom over four republican US senators." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anybody know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">Yes, "Alpha House," but it seems that not many can remember this show, because it was not so good.</seg>
<seg id="1072">It is just an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- as the average of this curve 7.4 is and Alpha House landet out at 7,5 -- a bit above average, but not just what Roy and his team worked.</seg>
<seg id="1073">About the same time at another company, another manager has plaziert a top-show by data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for program design of Netflix. exactly like Roy it is always searching for this a super show and he is also using data, but it makes it a different way.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of having a contest, he and his team looked at the existing data on the Netflix viewer, so the reviews that they give the shows whose shows they like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then use this data to find out these little details about the audience: which shows they like, which producers, which actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the parts together they went a car and decided to do not a Sitcom over four senators, but a drama series about a senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards." Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9,1 review on this bend. so exactly where they wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course the question is: what happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">One has two very competent, data diversified companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is that?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic somehow says that it should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If you collect millions of data, for a decision that meets, then you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years to statistics as back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It optimizes it by very powerful computer.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The mindeste you can expect is good TV, right?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis is not working so, this is something terrifying because we live in a time, in which we need more and more statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anybody know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">No one. OK, that's even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one ever comes in touch with this software. come in touch, you are in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1093">"" "" "" "if someone is in prison in the United States and for release, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dismissal is done or not." ""</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like at Amazon and Netflix. but instead of decide whether a show is good or bad will be decided whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Mediocre television, 22 minutes that can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results. that is not aware that a company like multi-health system does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">The data reversible firms are also wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google does make mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009, Google announced that it is possible due to data analysis of flu, bad way, predictions -- by data analysis of Google's research.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news-giving. the success was successful in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked fine, year around year, until it suddenly didn't work anymore,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And nobody could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It just didn't work, this was again a sensation, including the withdrawal of the release in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data is reversible firms such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">Despite all these errors, data flows down in decisions of life -- at work, in law enforcement, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So, we should rather ensure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in the computerized genetics -- an area where some very clever people unimaginable many data to make serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">"" "" "" "or the development of a medication. over the years I recognized some samples by the difference between successful decisions and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread." ""</seg>
<seg id="1110">You have to solve a complex problem, mainly do two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">First, put this problem into its parts, so that you can analyse the individual parts; as a second, you put the individual parts back together to hold a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: get apart and put together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to break a problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to add the parts again and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool for this and we all have it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something in which the brain is good, it is parts and pieces back together, even if the information is incomplete, in order to hold a good decision -- especially if it's the brain of an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Therefore, I think was Netflix so successful because they have used data and mind where they belong to the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">"" "they use data to better understand their audience, why they wouldn't have been able to put together all these parts, and make it a show like" "" "House of Cards" "", "which does not stand in the data." ""</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show, which meant that they entered a great personal risk of this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon on the other hand did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used data to control all their decisions, first as they chose TV ideas, then called "Alpha House" as a show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"" "it was a secure decision because they could always say:" "" "they tell us the data." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data is helpful for better choices, but I think things go wrong when data start to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data is only a tool, and around not to forget, this device is rather useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will become...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It is also called "Magic 8 Ball." it's amazing. for decisions using an Ja- or No question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer. "most likely" -- exactly here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will try it later with a technical demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">I have met some decisions in my life so far, I should have listened to the ball in the night.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you know, of course, if you have the data available, you want to replace them by something much more sophisticated, such as data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">Maybe the ball will clap and claimers, and ultimately it is in us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right curve.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I feel this as a very encouraging message that, despite the great amount of data, it is still paying off to make decisions to be an expert in what you do, and risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Because at the end, it is not the data but risks, with which you end up at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you nice.</seg>
