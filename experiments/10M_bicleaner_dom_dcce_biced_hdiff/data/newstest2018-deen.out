Munich , 1856 : four cards that change your ga@@ ze on the city
a Ir@@ ren @-@ An@@ st@@ alt , where young people are going to meet today .
a tomb stone where is excav@@ ated for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
the pe@@ as@@ su@@ gar@@ dener manage the former reasons for pe@@ as@@ ants .
the oldest official map of Munich encour@@ ages exciting stories about days .
it nerv@@ ousness , when maps are not currently current .
everybody knows who had already been exciting because the car Nav@@ i took place instead of a crossing road on a green meadow .
the historical maps of the digital Bayern @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort Bayern of the State Government , are all other than current - but therefore very conclu@@ sive .
especially when you compare it with current online cards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then it is clear how cities and communities have changed in the spread @-@ area of the Munich Merk@@ ur since the 19th century . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the digital Bayern at@@ las is a spl@@ its , that one does not recognize the same as such .
for cities and mun@@ icipalities of more detailed maps , so @-@ called urine leaves were incorporated .
these were created according to the Bavarian survey@@ or settlement between 18@@ 10 and 1864 , and skip the first survey@@ ance of Bavaria .
your client : Napoleon .
the French army occupied Bavaria since spring 1800 during the Second coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon took an overview of the occupied country and gave top@@ ographic survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .
finally , when French troops returned to the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville of February 9 , 1801 : it was today &apos;s neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bayern Map .
Kur@@ für@@ st Max IV Joseph progres@@ sed the project , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau , &quot; and therefore the Bay@@ erische Ver@@ mess@@ aging .
the document sheet for Munich is from the year 1856 and is available as any other on the Bavarian State Library &apos;s website .
the comparison early / today is the most pressing of the state capital .
the town has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
one example of this is sub@@ send@@ ling , which is relatively isolated in the map from 1856 .
S@@ end@@ ling was established 21 years after the creation of the map , so in 1877 , as a Munich district .
today , Unter@@ send@@ ling lies in the middle of the city .
the houses of the houses were concentr@@ ating in 1856 along the today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße which was named after George Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ ans@@ er , a leader of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where the West@@ park is , one sees nothing as fields - at first glance : a smaller card with dozens of lines and numbers : hand@@ written numbered pieces from the so @-@ called &quot; pri@@ mal &quot; which was derived from the basic tax .
little par@@ c@@ els there are no farmers no more - but sm@@ oul@@ ders of the plant &quot; land in sun . &quot;
a large green area is sign@@ alled north of the sub@@ send@@ ling .
the Ther@@ es@@ ien@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 of the Okto@@ ber@@ fest@@ s , was actually still a meadow - and no concrete desert .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the Ur@@ positi@@ onal flyer , one reads only the road name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the guest dough &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or from the hill &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the air &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ren An@@ st@@ alt &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yes , here on the Au@@ er@@ fel@@ d@@ straße one once locked people with mad@@ ness .
there was in 1858 / 59 the Munich Circle of Ir@@ ren@@ ese &quot; At the Au@@ er Lü@@ nen . &quot;
from 1872 Dr. Bernhard von G@@ ud@@ der directed the institution - the psychiat@@ rist , who is brought to the death of King Ludwig II in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was progressive for his time and ended for example the chains of the so @-@ called Ir@@ ren . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , he prohibited the staff to apply violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who has worked for an exhibition with An@@ st@@ alt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was a place for 280 patients , later was expanded to 500 seats .
eventually this capacity was not enough - the reason for the construction of the roundabout in hair 1905 .
the Is@@ ar @-@ A@@ MP@@ ER @-@ Klin@@ ikum Munich @-@ Ost is one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ rist@@ s since 2006 .
the territory of the former Au@@ er An@@ st@@ alt , young people meet in the Munich Sal@@ es@@ ian@@ um .
the order acquired the building complex in 1920 and walked in a youth home with training .
West is the TS@@ V Munich east entrance , east of the houses dating from the 1980s .
in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; built an architectural style on the origin of origin of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt , which was destroyed during the Second World War .
the Mari@@ en@@ platz was listed in 1856 as &quot; main square , &quot; the department store was called &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse . &quot;
the Second World War brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
in December 1944 the Al@@ lies were cut many holes to downtown in December 1944 .
a big one stayed until today - at the Mari@@ en@@ hof .
the English institute , small business buildings and a Gru@@ ft@@ kap@@ elle from the Middle Ages were once again at the Mari@@ en@@ hof , where this time the preliminary work will take place on 5 April 2017 at the ground@@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn course .
the old Munich @-@ card can be compared with the aerial photo of today - and fill the hole on the Mari@@ en@@ hof .
Civil Rights Announ@@ cement : Mis@@ souri by Mis@@ souri
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the National Association for the promotion of farms has issued a warning for colored people who travel to Mis@@ souri due to discrimin@@ ated politics and the rac@@ ist attacks of the state to Mis@@ souri . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the federal state of Mis@@ souri , who will enter into force by 28 August 2017 , calls for af@@ ro @-@ american trav@@ ellers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans , as a number of question@@ able , ra@@ cial @-@ based cases occur in the whole country and here , &quot; says it in the statement of the group .
a recent law of Mis@@ souri , which makes people harder to win discrimination , as well as the prosec@@ utor authorities of the state , signi@@ fying un@@ disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ately on min@@ orities , said the group to release the travel warning , said the NA@@ AC@@ P .
&quot; they have injuries of civil rights to pass people .
they will be stopped or killed because of their skin colour , &quot; said the president of the Mis@@ souri NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , the Kansas City Star .
&quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard . &quot;
it is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the USA .
the group cited inci@@ dents like ra@@ cial violation of black students at the University of Mis@@ souri and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee .
S@@ anders died under frag@@ ile circumstances from the beginning of the year , having no fuel during the journey through the state and was arrested by the police of Mis@@ souri in custody without being accused of crime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council also has shown a recent report by the Office of the Administrator @-@ General of Mis@@ souri in which it is shown that black drivers in the state will be 75 percent more common than the wh@@ ites . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the recommendation is that people are conscious and their families , friends and employees about what could happen in Mis@@ souri , &quot; said Chapel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people have to be willing to bring che@@ ating money , or let the relatives know that they are travelling through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mis@@ souri recorded 100 days in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the FBI , according to the latest figures from the FBI , which rank the state in terms of the number of such injuries to the 16th place of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the travel warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ souri law that would make it more difficult to su@@ e a company for housing or employment discrimination . &quot; &quot; &quot;
previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) had issued travel war@@ nings for Texas and Arizona after the States had agreed to undertake the local prosecution authorities to deal with people because of immigration violations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; travel warning are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , but l@@ ately , st@@ ak@@ eholders have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends in the USA . &quot; &quot; &quot;
electric fence project is elementary
the her@@ b@@ acher Wei@@ f@@ aun project is a success project and will continue in the coming year .
the CDU parliament ordered Peter white and K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac have provided a picture on the spot .
with the right @-@ gra@@ ding of the family of Schwen@@ demann , representatives of the CDU of the CDU , together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two de@@ pu@@ ties .
Markus Schwen@@ demann initially produced insights into its operation in which he manages 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows , and also many k@@ ittens and houses a holiday home in five apartments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schwar@@ zw@@ al@@ d@@ milch &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is used for him of the growing loose food market for milk of its cows , so piv@@ ot . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only regional to the table of the Feri@@ he@@ ist .
as he is also the BL@@ HV @-@ Chairman of Fisch@@ erb@@ ach , he referred to as &quot; elementary &quot; as &quot; elementary . &quot;
I can &apos;t work on such steep areas .
the Green land@@ scap@@ ing care for a lot of work , how many nuts are processed with the engine sense .
&quot; here we have to fight with the conditions and the top@@ ography , &quot; said Schwen@@ demann .
in 2003 he took over the el@@ ter@@ nal operation and managed this without chemical plant protection and ferti@@ liz@@ ers , even if he does not conduct bio @-@ operation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commun@@ e recognized the importance of the electric fence and is glad about the leader promoting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the farmers would have to be supported at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare .
we hope that the aff@@ o@@ rest@@ ation of the surfaces could still be drawn up for a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest treasure we have , are the people who work in agriculture and make thoughts about how they continue their operation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed the Mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the farmers are often in criticism of criticism
a total of 25 plots were fenced in the year 2013 on the electric fence .
the disclos@@ ure area is thus 40 hectares , which must not be att@@ ened at least 20@@ 23 .
half of the leader was funded by the total costs of 71 500 euros , a quarter carried by the community of Fisch@@ erb@@ ach .
consequently , the farmers remained 12 610 Euro , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometres of electric fence .
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ gevity of f@@ ences , &quot; said Schwen@@ demann .
K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac stressed : &quot; you are doing a really good job without farmers and farmers do not go . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also for Peter white stood firmly : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here are best food produced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the landscape of the landscape ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg allows the state subsi@@ dy to be managed .
the goal is to maintain the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald .
pr@@ er@@ equ@@ is@@ ite is the presence of one of the L@@ PR @-@ recorded convey@@ ing .
moreover , the enclosed area may not be dra@@ per@@ vas@@ cul@@ able ( hang@@ over 35 per cent ) and must be threatened with the aff@@ o@@ rest@@ ation .
for the year 2018 the application of eight participants with 24 par@@ c@@ els , which would like to build a fence about 16 kilometers of fence .
the disclos@@ ure area corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 Euro .
is nothing sacred anymore ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump is taking the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is it when they begin to attack statues .
the Americans like to appreciate such as every other - hence the sort of staged overthrow Saddam Hussein &apos;s place at the Fir@@ dos square in Bagh@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a hot fight with Jim A@@ cost@@ a by CNN about the proposals of the President to the dra@@ stic restri@@ ction of the legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty .
to stay fair , Miller did not handle the statue .
a hor@@ de of bo@@ at@@ is@@ ers and Liberty I@@ mit@@ ers would have suffered him , if he had done it .
but he took their significance , and in particular the meaning that it was written , as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the Monument , has been added to his base .
as Miller A@@ cost@@ a described , &quot; I don &apos;t want to go into a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom which light@@ ens the world .
the poem , which you refer to , was added later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
Miller is proper properly , but as he form@@ ulated it , it &apos;s not really about history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about contemporary resonance on the rebel@@ li@@ ous words of Lazarus , the only one in which a state does not only invites any old immigrants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your poor , your poor , / your fier@@ y masses , who year@@ ns to breathe freely , / p@@ lowing waste of your rich co@@ asts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a time to see better in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so@@ othing waste &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on our screens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he did not make sure these people are not welcome in Tr@@ um@@ ps USA .
this conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a bro@@ ader political and cultural conflict : in fact , a conflict about the importance of America .
Lazarus - and her friends who advised him to place their words after her death at the base - were very good that they had a highly political action .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American rep@@ ublic@@ an@@ ism by portra@@ ying the feminine em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in an un@@ used classic portra@@ yal of freedom .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in their poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and they themselves have another name : mother of ex@@ il@@ ant .
the combination of the poem with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist coup and a devast@@ ating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , people wanted to change it from right wing .
the great cry of Rush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argu@@ ed 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is nobody , but rather an early Ne@@ o@@ con@@ doms which brings the American flame into the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty is going forward .
it should bear tor@@ ches of freedom from the United States in the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch should not ligh@@ ten the way into the United States . &quot;
rather unusual , Lim@@ bau@@ gh came down here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the importance of the statue is wholly and even a question of the stand@@ point of perception . &quot; &quot; &quot;
indeed , the great imagin@@ ative act of Lazarus was to see them as they were of the exhau@@ st@@ ive , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible travel on the de@@ cks of ships .
it is about the tru@@ est sense to see the world from a perspective of people who seek refuge and improve a chance to improve their lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome you have to hear . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and of course this is not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump ever want to recognize .
their tor@@ ch shall not shine through the way , but hatred , who is the only source of power , ign@@ ite .
world Championship 2017 : Neil Black pra@@ ises Scottish members of the UK team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle re@@ members a time when only two vill@@ i belonged to the UK team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the performance director of the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom , Neil Black says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent in World Championship &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes selected for London in 2017 , starting on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Scotland there is something special &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom has to learn from it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it , and we are trying to understand it and we will continue , until we find out &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I speak with people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British Athletics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the street corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates , among them Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ cher - which will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was elected from the crew to the team captain .
&quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is pretty modest .
her captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; says Black .
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or where they still live or train , went out of room and felt very proud and were very motivated .
the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h was completely natural , were great . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Common@@ wealth of silver medal , which will compete in their fifth world championships with the 400 m hur@@ dle , says that it is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incredible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that 16 sh@@ all@@ ots are in the British team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which had been reached in 1983 and 2015 .
the center @-@ h@@ aul of Mu@@ ir leads on this path and set up five British and two European records in the past year .
it will be part of the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , the 1,500 m running , is another Sch@@ otte , which one was able to observe after a great season , which included the victory of the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games .
Do@@ yle re@@ members their first world championships when the only other Scot@@ sman was in Team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ nell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the man@@ go chapter says that they are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enorm@@ ously proud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that many of their fellow country@@ men do not only belong to the team , but in some cases also among the medals and at the fin@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the special thing about the team of team is to be chosen by the other members of the team , so that it was a great honour for me to know that my te@@ amm@@ ates have voted for me and have chosen it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added up to something special for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; obviously , I am very proud of all those who belong to the team .
it only shows how far we came .
and they are here as well @-@ established athletes , athletes who want to climb on po@@ di@@ ums .
what my speech concerns as capit@@ ulation ?
yes , I think she went well .
I have pointed out that we are very happy in this situation , as we have a home world championship .
so it is really important to put this home support and benefit from it that we are back in the Olympiastadion Berlin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I get a second chance to go and compete there and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
blocking of criticism about Facebook : don &apos;t worry about a public post if you do not able to heat up the elec@@ tron from voters
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not last long until the newspapers struck him because of everything , from indoor politics to its political principles .
he sm@@ iled at the cr@@ iti@@ que , safe .
but he did not put his critics to silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because in the year 17@@ 83 Washington said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and mu@@ te , we will be led to battles as sheep . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that brings me to Maryland Larry H@@ ogan expected to work on it , more like Washington .
H@@ og@@ an &apos;s staff have blocked contributions from at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union compl@@ ained him in the beginning of this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the governor &apos;s staff sent out the law@@ suit as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online comment was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Na , and ? &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is just Facebook , &quot; many people said .
but it is important .
and it is especially important when it is a type like H@@ ogan .
this is a rep@@ ubli@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amaz@@ ingly popular .
he has the branches of the Nation &apos;s 50 govern@@ ors .
H@@ ogan is not a re@@ ac@@ tionary hot head .
he has shown a fixed hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to principles .
he was also very sk@@ ill@@ fully to use Facebook as a primary means to connect to his voters and to make use his hair@@ less head after chemotherapy on his side .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the blocking of persons coming to the governor &apos;s side - which is a public forum that is called officially and of employees who are paid by public tax dollars - un@@ necessarily and ultimately dangerous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in an interview with The Washington Post , H@@ og@@ an Spe@@ aker Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse defended the actions of the governor and argu@@ ed that the blocking of the comments is nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it is too easy to use the image of Tro@@ l@@ len or sp@@ aw@@ ls or h@@ asser@@ ted people who vibr@@ ate online .
the post spoke with some of the real people being blocked by H@@ ogan .
and these are only true people who speak with their elected leaders : a teacher , a business@@ man and a priest , no tro@@ ll .
they all said that their comments were respec@@ tful , thou@@ ght@@ ful and not prof@@ ane .
the priest then cited the Bible in his post and app@@ alled to H@@ og@@ an Catholic faith .
lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani by Bo@@ wie , MD . , was not filled with water , but she asked for h@@ ass@@ fall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I commented on that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate and other current news , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote in the commentary field &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t appreciate this idea , if a number of people taking place on the same topic , then it is rather than a so @-@ called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what the governor of the Govern@@ ors as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated spam attack &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; would probably call others &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inter@@ c@@ ession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by blocking a critic or to delete a negative comment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is much cleaner than in earlier times if you have done the same that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical lad@@ ders and to burn or to silence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this just happens digitally .
H@@ ogan expected to be the first public official , which is critic@@ ized that he has compl@@ ained Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is compl@@ ained by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first milest@@ ones in this question was last week in Virginia .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of Lou@@ dou@@ n County injured the first am@@ us@@ ment , according to the U.S. District Judge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when they appointed a voters from their Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , governor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) received a visit from AC@@ L@@ U because of its use of Facebook and Twitter .
it should not be so hard .
at the time of Washington , the time of affordable por@@ tos had a similar effect as the Internet .
the number of newspapers multip@@ lies between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous post@@ p@@ ens struck on his guidance .
and even back then Washington had anonymous trol@@ ls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the people that pseud@@ ony@@ ms such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; wrote all the letters to newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pet@@ itions , who had critic@@ ized his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , trade and shipping with Britain , overwhel@@ med his office , according to historical documents collected by the Online Pap@@ ers of George Washington Project .
but he did not put them silence .
freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses belong to the basis of our nation .
and true guided tour means to accept that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort in Renaissance Club
the former European Union No 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope in the next three days of home comfort , since the Renaissance Club hosted the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who lost links to the final year in the Ar@@ cher@@ field , before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , is connected to the new venue and serves as a tournament ambassador in the name of the club founder and CE@@ Os Jerry Sar@@ v@@ adi .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how he reaches its fame with this event , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Raff@@ er@@ ty said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; players will see this course from his best side , it &apos;s in a great condition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jerry has made a great job , when he laid this place .
he is an e@@ ager advoc@@ ate of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great show@@ case for this course . &quot;
the Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defend a championship for the first time , although he won his 32 @-@ year career at the European Tour as well as at the European Challenge tour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this really feels particularly &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the player , in South@@ port . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have not able to defend the Extrem@@ ad@@ ura open , as it won in the year after I had won it out of the program . &quot; &quot; &quot;
back to this part of the world is magical .
it &apos;s a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories of the last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon , to win last year here .
it was a really special time and one that we always appreciate . &quot;
Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50th birthday this year , returns to his home country .
this event will be the first Scottish appearance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a little bit more when you play at home , &quot; Or@@ r said the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh .
&quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this extra pressure .
I really enjoyed playing , and I played a solid golf course .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad how it happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

fewer lung cancer by passive smoking
in the past two decades , less people have died due to passive smoking on lung cancer .
scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( UK@@ E ) come in a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates , 167 lung cancer cases are attri@@ but@@ able to passive smoking , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said studies manager Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a comparison , he moved to his own study on this subject from 1994 .
there were still 400 lung cancer cases for pas@@ siv@@ ity per year in Germany .
the new investigation is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
household connections are proved to be very complex
the construction work in the Vill@@ inger street are in full swing and &quot; are reason@@ ably in time , &quot; says the leader of the builder Fred Hein@@ ze .
in the house connections , the situation is more complicated than susp@@ ects , because there is a lot in the sub@@ strate , which is not noted in the plans .
the traffic , which is always ob@@ struc@@ ted the construction work , represents a big problem for the construction group of St@@ ump@@ p company .
&quot; the ignor@@ ance of drivers before red lights and slopes are already enormous , &quot; reported Hein@@ ze .
the road is closed , and only the buses are entitled to pass through .
Angelo Car@@ uso , Marvin Kost@@ or@@ z and Tim Kost@@ or@@ z from the firm of St@@ ump@@ p have been busy working on the bridge since weeks .
&quot; the hot days were very exhau@@ sting .
but fortunately we were powered by our friend Fritz Matt with cool mineral water , &quot; explains Marvin Kost@@ or@@ z .
poverty and death in Indonesian Gold@@ land
if Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks the dinner , they don &apos;t use a stove .
they even use a pot but rarely .
in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of Pan@@ i province in Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife usually puts a sweet potato - locally as &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly in the chim@@ ney .
after half an hour the tri@@ mm@@ ed dum@@ b with e@@ ager , un@@ washed hands is taken and dev@@ oured .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay ground - she has no furniture - where they can also perform their daily work , e.g. clothes with d@@ ull water from the nearby sw@@ amp .
a bucket in a homeless space serves as a lat@@ rine .
the youngest of the four wives of her husband were assigned to their fields .
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
of course it can be dangerous to work : most vill@@ men are unemployed , and many drink difficult , and there are the soldiers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one dar@@ es to run after 17 o &apos;clock in the village , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a rare impression of everyday life in the high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was admitted to a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1.0@@ 26 elders would vote in front of the occup@@ ying troops .
an existing movement , which touched for independence against the Dutch rule , turned quickly against the government of Jak@@ arta who maintains control of the region and foreign journalists or legal ob@@ servers .
in 2003 the province was officially divided into Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , with the independent part of Pap@@ ua New Guinea as the eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as isolated as it is deser@@ ted . the journey includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the province of Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning five @-@ hour drive with the rental car .
there is no public transportation .
the town with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants is composed of wooden houses , surrounded by bam@@ boo forests , and from corrugated roofs that were converted into various yellow @-@ brown tones .
only very few Indones@@ ians have made their journey here , sh@@ out for journalists and practically no fore@@ ig@@ ner .
before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans sent a god named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were also other changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were not used to wear these clothing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and indicates their lively , hand woven tur@@ ban , its dark shirt and their bright rock . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the past we had only leaves on our bodies . &quot;
Pap@@ ua is Indonesia &apos;s p@@ oo@@ rest province where 28 % of people live under the poverty line and some of the worst children &apos;s mort@@ als and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also Indonesia Gold@@ land .
the largest and most profitable gold mines in the world , gr@@ assy mountain , owned by the Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a province province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort has min@@ ed gold and copper as a value of 3.1 billion US dollars .
in addition , Pap@@ ua has a balance of wood resources worth $ 78 billion .
however , this wealth of wealth are a source of mis@@ ery for Pap@@ ua , making sure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military has been an av@@ oc@@ ative presence .
an investigation from 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort has paid local military personnel and units between 1998 and 2004 almost $ 20 million , including up to 150,000 US dollars on a single officer .
Pap@@ u@@ anic demands on greater autonomy threat@@ ens these Golden G@@ ans and are treated mer@@ cil@@ ess .
according to activists , more than 500,000 Pap@@ ua were killed and thousands were ra@@ ped and imprisoned since 1969 by the Indonesian military .
massacre in Pap@@ u@@ as tri@@ bal in the 1970 @-@ s became a genocide in accordance with the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission .
in the region alone , the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful protest@@ ers in the past year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we Will Be Everything &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means it is in a report from the arch@@ di@@ oc@@ ese Brisbane taken from the year 2016 , in which reports on atro@@ cities of the previous year are particularly popular with regard to another report - and the brutal precip@@ itation of peaceful demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims since every week inci@@ dents , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch .
the bolts have intensi@@ fied , since Pap@@ u@@ as resources have an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % of Christian , but demo@@ graphic developments are changing , since Muslim business immigrants come from the popul@@ ous islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sumatra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .
Jav@@ an@@ es@@ al@@ ung cant@@ ines sell fried chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetables served with pean@@ ut ss@@ au@@ ce .
local people are fighting for it here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; migrants have begun , chickens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local pap@@ ua , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains A@@ be@@ th You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ native , who moved to the capital city of Jay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has cost the native Pap@@ ua - the mom &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ um &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Pap@@ ua - their market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Indonesian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , known in the Volk@@ sm@@ und as Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised the im@@ balance and infr@@ in@@ gement of the Pap@@ ua for his campaign in 2014 .
the former Zimmermann secured 27 of the total 29 districts of Pap@@ ua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the Presi@@ dential Palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Pap@@ ua little changed , and today the locals feel betra@@ yed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our hearts are broken because we voted for Jok@@ ow@@ i in 2014 , with anticip@@ ation that he will meet our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
actually , Pan@@ i@@ ai actually suffered an underground point for two months after Jok@@ ov@@ is &apos;s inauguration in October .
on 7 December 2014 there was a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indonesian soldiers broke out through the darkness .
the fri@@ ghtened children said to them , that they should switch their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers with@@ drew from her tone , and returned with four soldiers later , according to the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had drunk , pursued and beat the group with their guns , said victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fired in the children &apos;s group .
a child , 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was struck so hard that he fell into the coma .
a few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and the things calculated on the next day .
about 1.000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered themselves on a football pitch in front of the local police station and the military commander centre to demand justice .
they carried out cerem@@ on@@ ial hunting ar@@ ches and carried the orph@@ ita dance - in the circle continuously and a bir@@ ch@@ ang im@@ iti@@ ful - by Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ Stamm .
some demonstr@@ ators began to tow stones on police and military post .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when the atmosphere was heated , the soldiers were sent a command via an internal radio : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the masses have been killed more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says in an official document of TIM@@ E which was not released to local media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ quad@@ ru@@ els by En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threat@@ ening danger and called for peace and demanded the crowd to return home .
nobody was listening to the mood .
&quot; when I turned around , I was suddenly shot in my left wr@@ ist , &quot; he said TIM@@ E on the porch of his colorful wooden house .
Kay@@ ame knows not yet who fired , but says that the bul@@ let came out of the ranks of the soldiers met here .
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds .
the local man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his c@@ ousin , the witness was the shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ran to him and sought his body to be sure that he was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es said just as many Indones@@ ians only bear a name , the TIM@@ E in dark mood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I saw that he was dead ... I have kissed him . &quot;
the Chief of the Pap@@ ua Police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , said Rep@@ orters that his officers wanted to secure their station only &quot; because they are being attacked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves when people threatened to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Pap@@ ua police , Commissioner Pud@@ jo Su@@ list@@ i@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others hurt .
the messages on the k@@ illings came only on the following day &apos; filtered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
three weeks , Jok@@ ov@@ i kept a passionate speech in Jay@@ ap@@ ura for the families of the victims and sw@@ am to tackle the historical ab@@ ut@@ ors in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case to be solved immediately so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; security Minister Wir@@ anto said in October 2016 that he interven@@ e an extra@@ judicial mechanism for attachment of historical human rights violations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the words started almost immediately .
&quot; most injuries have occurred long ago .
some were in the 90 @-@ s and early 2000 @-@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we have committed to tackle these violations , but there are processes that have to pass through , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; then Wir@@ Esper@@ anto made a retreat when he spoke on 5 June in Jak@@ arta with TIM@@ E and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has no plans to establish a complaint in Pap@@ ua . &quot; &quot; &quot;
instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wir@@ anto , who accused the UN for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said that 11 cases of human rights violations had been settled in Pap@@ ua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai stock . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims took such claims with fierce dis@@ believers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I inter@@ viewed in the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es .
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says that he still lives in fear years later .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am afraid to be arrested by the military , I &apos;m afraid to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident .
he says he was beaten by the military , after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after I had buried the body , the military sought me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sho@@ wer@@ ies have not ceased .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police fired on vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confron@@ tation between vill@@ agers and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma that refused to bring a un@@ conscious man into the hospital , a person and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old ra@@ viol@@ anus Dou@@ w who was drow@@ ned when he was fishing in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital .
the vill@@ agers were protest@@ ing before the company &apos;s site .
the police told that the vill@@ agers threw stones on officers who responded by warning signs .
but locals say that the mobile Brigade ( Indonesian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began to shoot the crowd and killing one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that it will give revenge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u B@@ adi@@ i who lives near the hospital and witness , as the injured one has been delivered quickly , so the TIM@@ E .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have hidden myself in my house for two days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai Parliament is called to pull the officers to comp@@ ose the officers and withdraw the police force of the police from the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always an accident at the Indonesian government .
lack of meaningful development strength@@ ens the dis@@ satisfaction of the tribe of Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dani and Dam@@ al who live in the green high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua .
many of the &quot; Free Pap@@ ua Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) joined the rebel army , cla@@ iming to defend the rights of the Pap@@ ua by pushing for spor@@ adic attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of Indonesian soldiers .
some of the top @-@ O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , among them T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das Kog@@ o@@ ya .
in response to this , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were arrested and arbit@@ rar@@ ily taken in custody under the pre@@ text of &quot; securing the national sovereignty . &quot;
some never sc@@ uba diving again .
among men in Pap@@ ua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as a &quot; a tragic , forgotten location . &quot;
poverty strength@@ ens the dis@@ satisfaction .
the little rice , which is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , is too expensive for locals .
bread is just out of reach .
the people here are building everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women working with four or five fields of fresh@@ water supply .
they keep the majority of the harvest for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10,000 ind@@ ones@@ ian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 C@@ ents ) .
over time , economic ine@@ qualities have grown between the native Pap@@ ua and the new migrants since the opening of new escape to Nab@@ ire Airport has arrived in greater numbers .
the few jobs that exist in the region , usually go to better educated and wealthy migrants .
Pap@@ ua rarely have capital or the necessary skills to lead their own company competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the young people are not interested in keeping in the village ... for there is no jobs or money , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , Chairman of the Board of Directors of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot; &quot; &quot;
isolation holds the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
moreover , restrictions from the reporting international media remain ten@@ se .
at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ das and Bas@@ ille Long@@ ch@@ amp were deported to Pap@@ ua for lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua .
according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ins , the Deputy Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is campaign , to raise awareness of reporting to transparency and development , were not realised .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists who try to report on Indonesia &apos;s most peaceful provinces of Pap@@ ua and West@@ pap@@ ua : visa ref@@ usal and a black list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lack of press control means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely limited to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in March , six pac@@ ific states - Ton@@ ga , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Mar@@ sh@@ all@@ in@@ ders and the Salom@@ ons Islands - the UN Human Rights Council , to investig@@ ate the various and widespread injuries &quot; in Pap@@ ua including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting .
the same countries have historically been supported by O@@ PM .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the spokes@@ man of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha Nas@@ ir demonstrated the accus@@ ations back and said journalists in Jak@@ arta , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Indonesia is still a democratic system , and there are free media , so it is difficult to susp@@ end the evidence of human rights fail@@ ures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the people on the spot want more foreign governments to realize this .
as an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the direction of the human rights ambassador Ke@@ es Van B@@ aar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura broke her silence and th@@ ron@@ ged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also participated in the session but would remain anonymous .
Indonesia has a further presidential election in 2019 , but the Pap@@ ua said they probably won &apos;t be able to vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i .
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good inten@@ tions , but it is surrounded by people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai sho@@ ots , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the stem .
he wants to know that Jok@@ ov@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from that it lives under the constant threat of a blu@@ ish military , is present in poor educational and health services .
Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , consider her voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; blame &quot; which he must pay back .
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite the threats and in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai sho@@ ots had a last symbolic act of Des@@ p@@ ite : the cor@@ p@@ ses of a victim was buried on a terrain exactly opposite the police and the military station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that perhaps they will never come true to them , but at least they don &apos;t forget the leaders of their crimes .
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with a straight head .
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire on the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ pers from Dubai to the second time
a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest building towers of the world in Dubai its circulation and forced hundreds of residents , from which 3@@ 37 meters high , 79 @-@ storey buildings to flee .
it is the second fir@@ ing that swe@@ eps in just two years through the high @-@ rise gate , which is called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) .
the building was evacu@@ ated , and injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; we slept and we got up at the fire alarm and the scre@@ aming of the people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50th floor to the bottom , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; told a inhabit@@ ant named George An@@ ab , Reuters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dub@@ ais civil protection authorities said that units of fire fighting against 4.@@ 00 local time ( 00@@ .00 UTC ) the fire extingu@@ ished and the building freeze .
the government said they work on the provision of accommodations for those concerned .
the incident can ask questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas around the world , revi@@ ving .
an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after the fire in 2015 revealed that the biggest part of the damage from the cl@@ adding , outside facing for decoration or isolation , came .
in the UK , the police told them that the system of plates for isol@@ ating and cl@@ adding to the London Gren@@ ad@@ coat tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire that died about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup reform : next Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International Tennis Association ( IT@@ F ) had its large Davis Cup Cou@@ p on the General Assembly .
at the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City , it was only supported for this sport revolutionary proposal , Davis Cup single only on two winners , w@@ afer @-@ thin not supported by the required two @-@ third majority .
the often very long , but also very estimated five @-@ set classics remain in the traditional age .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 6@@ 3.@@ 54 % of the member countries voted to reform the goal of the IT@@ F president David Hag@@ ger@@ ty , therefore only scar@@ c@@ ely missed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our member nations did not have the whole reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of this iconic and historical con@@ tests , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ g@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will continue to work to improve the application .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only after the vote , after many claims , the final has come to carry out the final on a neutral spot . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new from 2018 are only compar@@ atively smaller details : the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will soon have the host right next year in the first round .
to reduce the cost of the organiz@@ ers , the requirements in training places etc. will be facil@@ itated and the players will have to complete the Davis Cup less official media appoin@@ tments .
more than 1 out of 5 US trav@@ eler brings forbidden items into the plane , finding a survey
a survey conducted among air pass@@ ers showed that more than 20 percent deliber@@ ately caused or un@@ consci@@ ously banned items in the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent , while acci@@ dentally carried out kni@@ ves or other items with blades .
less than 1 percent claimed they would have discovered that they had to be irr@@ ational with fire@@ arms , amm@@ un@@ ition or explo@@ sives .
the survey on more than 1,000 people - which was carried out by a jet @-@ Char@@ ter@@ service , Strat@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , was also noted that younger trav@@ ellers have rather reli@@ eved the rules .
of those survey@@ ed , the enco@@ res that they might have tried to fly with something that was forbidden by the T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 percent Mill@@ enni@@ als were compared to less than 15 percent of the members of generation X .
the most common items which were inten@@ tionally resolved at T@@ SA agents were food and fluids .
in order to have more than 3 percent , in order to have borne objects with blades due to security control , while 2.2 percent of female respon@@ dents and 3.7 percent of the male respon@@ dents have also confirmed that they had inten@@ tionally brought drugs to the plane .
the company said that travelers were inter@@ viewed around the country to find out how many acci@@ dentally s@@ mu@@ g@@ gles had been brought through the airport security and how many would have done .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is no surprise that people who are most often s@@ mu@@ g@@ able - know@@ ingly or not know@@ ingly - by security , those who are most frequently flying . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the company indicates that the T@@ SA guidelines are a bit complicated and conf@@ using .
people are often uncertain how liquids are allowed to take it , or how much of them .
so there is no surprise that the largest amount of the items forbidden by the T@@ SA are forbidden liquids .
for a time , the people that T@@ SA might look at books as s@@ mu@@ g@@ gling .
liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t matter : tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel order
&quot; &quot; &quot; electric @-@ thou@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k is fond of the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tesla &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Model 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so far , he has under@@ gone that a part of the customer has already with@@ drawn their non @-@ binding reservation .
in addition to the always triumph@@ al figures to sales and even more huge sales targets , Tesla @-@ Chef El@@ on Mus@@ k showed another less smooth number for the first time : the cancellations made at the new mass market @-@ model 3 .
in the past months , Mus@@ k had applied more than 500,000 orders for the new car in the past few months .
now Mus@@ k is a : 63@@ .000 pre @-@ orders have been with@@ drawn from a total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre@@ orders .
critics have always pointed out that it is merely a non @-@ exist@@ ent reservations .
at a cancellation , Tesla then pays 1000 Euro ( in the US $ 1000 and in the UK 1000 pounds ) .
at present , 45@@ 5,000 of such non @-@ binding reservations , Mus@@ k will be held at a telephone conference with analysts .
however , the cancellation of up to about twelve per cent of all orders could be solved to date , the Tesla boss did not believe .
its argument : the challenge for ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production page .
in the past year Tesla had supplied 8@@ 4,000 vehicles .
2018 it is supposed to be combined with all models - 500,000 one million by 2020 .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k the date of 1800 reservations are scheduled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whoever can order a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Model 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , can expect extra@@ dition at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - when Tesla manages to drive its brand new , never in practice tested production lines with maximum load capacity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many experts doubt that this is possible .
if it comes to larger delays , then the un@@ binding of reservations could become a problem for Tesla .
for then the company can &apos;t stop by dis@@ satisfied customers in dro@@ ves .
EPA boss P@@ ru@@ itt moves back because of the amend@@ ment of the rules of the Obama @-@ Er@@ a to reduce emissions
one day after he had been su@@ ed by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the chief of the Environmental Protection Agency , took back his earlier decision to reduce the rules of the Obama era to reduce the emissions of smo@@ g caused by air poll@@ ut@@ ants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change when his agency proved to meet the needs of state environmental authorities against re@@ acting faster than previous administration .
he did not mentioned the law@@ suit against his previous post in a Federal District Court .
it is a term that ran on 1 October for States to hold the 2015 standards of ground @-@ near o@@ zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he would not hesitate to spend a year in order to study and avoid his authority to study the plan , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to inter@@ fere in local decisions or to hin@@ der economic growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was before his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump At@@ tor@@ ney of Oklahoma , was a long time a reliable opponent , stric@@ ter environmental legislation .
since his arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly passed to block regul@@ ators , or to delay the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels .
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the latest legal reg@@ ression for the regulatory roll@@ back agenda .
last month , a Federal Court of Appeal decided that the EPA Administrator has passed its authority to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration , the oil and gas enterprises to monitor and reduce methane le@@ cks to delay .
in one on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt suggested that his in@@ sol@@ st@@ ice in o@@ zone standards simply sounded the will@@ ingness of EPA to collabor@@ ate with the states due to the complex process of timely performance of the new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under previous administrative , the EPA often failed to hold the dead@@ lines for carrying out activists and others , and in an agreement reached the date for carrying out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ru@@ itt , who drove EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we do not believe in regulation of jurisdiction , and we take Fri@@ sten seriously .
we also take the law and authority that gives us serious . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the opinion of EPA said that P@@ ru@@ itt had to use his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; power to delay and all other legally available authority &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to ensure that the regulations are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in congress are pushing for a comprehensive new version of the o@@ zone rules .
a bill of law approved in the last month approved the implementation of the 2015 regulations by at least eight years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the measure has not yet been placed in the Senate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the New York State At@@ tor@@ ney General Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who accompanied the coalition of the states that the EPA had compl@@ ained in this week , said the Group intended to maintain the legal pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the revers@@ al of EPA - according to our complaints - is an important profit for health and security of these 6.7 million New York and the more than 115 million Americans that flows directly from the Smo@@ g , who flows directly from the smooth@@ ness , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this case , California , Connec@@ tic@@ ut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , Iowa , Maine , Massachusetts , Minnesota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ sy@@ l@@ van@@ ien , Rhode Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
ground @-@ o@@ zone occurs when poll@@ ut@@ ants are made from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere on sunlight .
the resulting smooth@@ g can cause serious respir@@ atory problems in sensitive groups , and contribute each year to thousands of premature death cases .
representatives of public health and environmental protection che@@ ered at the closing of the exchange .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s troubled how much pressure it takes to receive this reasonable step from the responsibility for the protection of the air we inhal@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ ori Ann Bur@@ d from the Center for Bi@@ ological Diversity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to fight against the ide@@ ological cr@@ us@@ ade of the Tr@@ ump @-@ government to tackle environmental poll@@ ut@@ ants and their particular interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tur@@ f celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius church
750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the jubil@@ ee of the Berg@@ kirche the old cemetery @-@ area in Tum@@ ble will be invited to a Ser@@ en@@ ade on Sunday , July 16th .
whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village is the historic St. Hil@@ arius station a popular place to stay .
visitors of the sixth Bene@@ fi@@ z Ser@@ en@@ ade can be en@@ chan@@ ted by this powerful place .
the rescue and conservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and sponsors for their concerns .
Walter Mart@@ ini stressed : &quot; it is a unique d@@ ör@@ gy gem . &quot;
in 12@@ 67 , the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was first mentioned in the Wür@@ ttem@@ bür@@ g@@ isch documents . &quot; count Hermann of Sul@@ z sold &quot; the mountain with the church of Eber@@ hard by Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver .
according to the document , on the Tum@@ linger mountain , there was also a splendid courtyard , which belonged to the church or the patron saint , and not vice versa .
so there lived people there .
as from the description of the Upper Freu@@ den@@ stadt from 1858 , it was beside the sub@@ village and the Upper Village that are still visible in the village of Tum@@ ble , the &quot; Berg &quot; of the third , the gorgeous sett@@ lers of the village .
ancient maps of time around 1600 are under@@ pinn@@ ed this historical conditions .
the Pat@@ ron@@ ate law emerged from the early medieval y@@ enkir@@ chen law .
one Lord , built a church , arranged and occupied with a priest , stayed at the owner of this church , and he could also inherit these y@@ enkir@@ che church .
this was right to place a priest , or to propos@@ e a priest to the bishop .
there were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the size of the two scattered at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell rang the first time in 16@@ 92 , but later had to be released in the Second World War in 1942 .
in the Thir@@ ty Years War ( 16@@ 16 @-@ 16@@ 48 ) , the windows were stolen and the bells were stolen .
the roof was un@@ dense .
in 17@@ 96 French troops en@@ camped near the church .
they broke out the pul@@ pit and n@@ ak@@ chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
the remains of the church threatened to fall in 18@@ 09 .
until 1869 the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from the radio .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was extended and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was demolished .
only the church tower was left standing .
in the New Year &apos;s eight 18@@ 34 a storm caught the church tower and the half collapsed .
to prevent disaster , the tower was demolished .
only the high tower of the tower remained in today as a witness to the 750 year old church history .
today , Horst K@@ allen@@ berg and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em is the help of the &quot; Schaff@@ hausen pension@@ ers &quot; as successor of Dieter Dock@@ horn .
as an organis@@ er , the friends and supporters of the Tum@@ lin@@ gens invite their friends on Sunday , July 16th , to the sixth ser@@ en@@ ade on the old cemetery at St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle .
this is designed by the com@@ bo of the Kepler @-@ Gymnasium Freu@@ den@@ stadt with essays by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Reinhold Mat@@ te@@ is .
he conclu@@ des the village of Hartmut Rom@@ ann .
the program starts at 16.@@ 30 .
admission is available from 15.@@ 30 .
the end of the ser@@ en@@ ade takes place a trunk in front of the cemetery .
&quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shadow of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to forest , &quot; the organis@@ ers make the fantastic view out .
the Ser@@ en@@ ade is only held on dry weather .
the organiz@@ ers hope for many supporters for ob@@ taining historical St. Hil@@ arius system , which is important for tum@@ ours and hearing .
the friends and supporters of the tum@@ ours feel very committed to home care , such as Ser@@ en@@ ade organis@@ er Walter Mart@@ ini .
organisation wants to test permission of wind turbines
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim we@@ eds &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not see the legal pre@@ condition for the construction and has therefore turned to the Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; club has denied &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CDU ) to take its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is illegal .
the association has argu@@ ed that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette no wind turbines could have been approved , since at the time in Vier@@ sen only a wind power concentration zone has existed .
within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , but the concentration zone causes a exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the urban area .
such fields are to prevent a &quot; saving of the landscape . &quot;
a few days earlier , the city of Vier@@ sen had decided to change a second wind turbine zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette . however , the District Government of Düsseldorf had not been approved because of a form@@ ist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the lack of planned legal requirements , the ordered appro@@ vals is un@@ lawful and therefore , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , Chairman of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim For@@ ward himself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
current state of things : the city council has once again decided to re @-@ end the wind@@ concentration zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette ; a permission from the District government is still pending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that the creation of approval for the construction of wind turbines is legally excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the receipt of the invitation .
&quot; the corresponding writings have been received by the circle since last week , &quot; said a spokes@@ man .
the circle takes her to check the issue again .
however , they do not expect that the procedure is stopped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with a look at the administrative district of the administrative district , the circle didn &apos;t want to deal with the argument of the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , is planning on an area at the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette the construction of four ever 200 metres high wind turbines .
already last year , the company had been involved in which the city of Vier@@ sen is enclosed , lease contracts with the owner of approximately 65 hectares of land .
with the establishment of four wind turbines , electricity needs to be covered by around 11 400 households , which corresponds to about one @-@ fifth of the electricity needs of all four @-@ sen@@ er households .
the NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
last summer , there was a green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the wind park L@@ inn@@ ich at Aachen and a stake in a wind turbine in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district Hein@@ sberg .
car and tractor Kra@@ chen together : woman dies at terrible accident
one terrible traffic accident has taken place on Friday afternoon against 10 am on the L 333 between low @-@ s@@ wir@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhine @-@ L@@ ahn circle ) .
a woman was injured again .
two other people were injured .
the state road remained blocked over hours .
after police officers , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman came from Bor@@ n@@ ich with their passenger car as part of the accompanying driving with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother as accompanying person the L 333 in the direction of Bo@@ gel .
city and dealer plan &quot; Home @-@ shopping &quot; -@@ weekend
bad Langen@@ sal@@ a@@ er and people from the region are to explore the shops in downtown area in September .
the commercial association and municipal authorities want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to l@@ ure the inhabitants of shopping in the city center .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Chairman of the Trade Union , Christian King , announced the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Home Sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weekend to ensure that offers the own city aside from the usual supermarket goods . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is therefore a market with regional providers , similar to the weekly market .
local companies are to present themselves with their training places .
in addition , the shops of the city centre are to invite &apos; Mit@@ ter@@ am @-@ Sh@@ opp@@ en . &quot;
this action is not only in the inhabitants of the city and the local region .
in preparation , advertising spots on the radio , internet video and printed bag that point to the action weekend so Christian King .
the City Government and Trade Society collabor@@ ate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
thus , the Trade Society and the City entered another stage of the &quot; At@@ trac@@ tive city . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these include new offers as the first &quot; Active &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Active Day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the Brun@@ nen@@ fest as well as sold Sunday , talks with all tra@@ des@@ men and hosts to move it to active participation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
attractive offers on Saturday and commercial parks on this day are part of the concept .
customer potential will also be re@@ opened or opened again .
these include spa visitors and tourists .
but many locals also have lost the city center when shopping from the sight .
at the end , all of them would have to help to anim@@ ate the city center - up to land@@ lords , all over the city and clubs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it landed , with a network that made the Le@@ th@@ arg@@ y that spread themselves apart , had said King in spring . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Birgit Stre@@ ich , head of the I@@ HK Center in Müh@@ l@@ hausen , divided the third &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Home Sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; day to take part five Thur@@ ing@@ ian towns . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to Bad Langen@@ sal@@ sa this Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Hei@@ ligen@@ stadt and Blei@@ cher@@ ode .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tag should advert@@ ise on the appreciation of local trade and make its importance for the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stre@@ ich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the action under the lead of the I@@ HK and with many partners also make a clear that every citizen can act with his purchase behaviour in a direct environment itself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two deaths and several injured after explosion at US school
during construction , there was a gas explosion in the school building .
new more people were injured .
during a gas explosion in the U.S. town of Minne@@ apolis , two people were killed and nine were injured , some of them seriously injured .
according to the fire brig@@ ade was on Wednesday ( local time ) another last in critical condition .
a man died when a part of a school building fell in the explosion .
a first di@@ mi@@ ster was also found dead later .
at the dead it was a school for employees .
as a result , the authorities suspected the work on a gas line .
during the holiday period only a few people stopped in the Minne@@ apolis building .
Tr@@ ump replaced the tran@@ scri@@ bing tran@@ scription of phone calls to Mexico under pressure due to the payment of the border wall .
tran@@ scription of phone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders from Mexico and Australia were published by Washington Post .
on 27 January , Tr@@ ump asked to quit in a phone with the Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena Nie@@ to , publicly to say that he would not pay for a planned border .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the US president suspended him because he had publicly de@@ ferred the wall . according to report , he said to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t tell the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump started its presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall at the southern border of the USA , and s@@ wore to Mexico for the project .
tran@@ scription of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ halle were also published and revealed a cl@@ amped exchange .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr. Turn@@ it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stupid , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stupid , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that the existence on the market would look like a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after he proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees in the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump ended the call after he said Mr Turn@@ it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the most unpleasant call for the whole day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Moo@@ res Ford massacre : activists perform rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice again
a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mercury continued through a group of viewers in rural Monroe , Georgia , and shr@@ unk to the Ford Bridge from Moore .
before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , could reach the bridge , a group of white men with rif@@ les came out to block his way .
the leader of the bul@@ let - a man of middle aged in a needle @-@ strip - took a long turn on his cig@@ ar , looking ahead through the wind@@ shield .
inside , the occup@@ ants were fri@@ ghtened .
&quot; we want this n --@@ -- and Roger ! &quot; ro@@ ared the man .
&quot; get it out of the car ! &quot;
he scre@@ ams the silence , when a young black man was dist@@ orted by the passenger seat .
thank@@ fully , this terrible scene is played on July 22 , only a post@@ pon@@ ement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; almost all of them are very fond of the audience . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2005 , citizens &apos; rights to Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge have come back to im@@ itate the night in the two black pairs - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com and George and Mae Murray Dor@@ sey - were received by K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one was accused of murder .
&quot; it is really un@@ imagin@@ able that in all these years no one person was arrested - although we know they are in our communities , although we know who they are , &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps the organisation of the post@@ age .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a dirt spot on a history , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former Congress of State of Georgia and a Life@@ time Citi@@ zenship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for him , the post@@ pon@@ ement serves as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual memory of the Monroe community that has never been corrected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to pursue judgment , we want healing , we want cure , but first we must receive justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we cannot get to cure and reconciliation , until we get justice . &quot;
a bai@@ li@@ ant finds a sheets on the body of one of the victims of Moore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ n on July 27 , 1946 .
according to FBI files , who have been preserved by the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding coun@@ ties have been suspected of the Lyn@@ ch@@ process .
but no one was ever accused .
although the susp@@ ects stay on free foot for decades , citizens say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions in the whole city was always known : Politics and sex .
in April 1946 a decision of the Supreme Court of Justice made it possible for the first time in Georgia to vote for their vote in the summer .
approximately at the same time as the choice according to the FBI , Roger Mal@@ com worked a white land owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a struggle - supp@@ os@@ edly because of a woman .
Broo@@ ks said that rum@@ our was in the city that H@@ ester had slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby , which she bore , was not of her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Harrison , a prominent white land@@ owner , 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , so the FBI .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her cou@@ sins Mae Murray and George Dor@@ sey to prison .
but when she went away from the prison , the Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge approached , ring@@ ing a ly@@ ch@@ mo@@ b the car .
&quot; as it turns out , there was Harrison that prepared the mor@@ de and ordered it , &quot; conclu@@ des a FBI report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspi@@ racy between the state and local prosec@@ utions that was not only involved in murder , which removed the evidence and conce@@ aled the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks form@@ ulates it even more magnificent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a candidate for election , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed in order to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to register and vote , then you will happen here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for almost a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the annual production of the Moore Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
their presentation is illustr@@ ative , gri@@ pping and is justified in a kind of deep rac@@ ism , of which many believe that he doesn &apos;t exist in America anymore .
it is hard to watch , and even more difficult to look , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ ch because we are confron@@ ted with its gl@@ iness in all of us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I can &apos;t build a relationship with you , if you don &apos;t want to listen or hear what I have done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen wh@@ ites and the rest of black - in a room and lau@@ ght , as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ played overview of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is Green@@ it Co @-@ Director .
he has played the role of chief C@@ lan@@ co member since years , but he said he never becomes easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it is very important to receive this story of life , because we don &apos;t want to return to those times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room the actor D@@ arri@@ us Brad@@ sh@@ aw and Nick Ras@@ con@@ a , the Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester play their lines .
the piece starts with Mal@@ com , the H@@ ester is scre@@ wed and pushed him , angry that he has slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He was w@@ ishing of my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ras@@ con@@ a bl@@ ends fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least every black actor ) breaks out into laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the bottom .
&quot; what ? ! &quot; asked Ras@@ con@@ a .
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; Gre@@ ene said , always ch@@ uck@@ ling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just don &apos;t think white people have said &apos; n --- he &apos; said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , &quot; wit@@ t one of the other black actors .
&quot; you just have to meet the hard &apos; R. &apos; .
and exactly as it moves the energy in the space , a feeling of camera replaces the un@@ eas@@ iness .
everyone is busy with this , not just because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed persons .
the scene begins again .
this time , when Ras@@ con@@ a says the N word , he says it sharp and with im@@ print .
absolutely no one laughs .
this repet@@ ition ends violent and fast .
there are scre@@ ams , nuts and then silence .
a woman , dressed with a fun@@ eral g@@ own , stands above the cor@@ p@@ ses of actor and leads to Billi@@ ons Holidays &quot; St@@ range Fru@@ it . &quot;
your voice breaks at every second word .
about a hundred meters behind it a group of about four dozen people caught per@@ spiration and tears from the eyes .
the audience is divided almost evenly between black and white .
a couple is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , travelled to see the performance , many come down just the street .
they have spent almost eight hours of Geor@@ gi@@ as impressive moisture when Broo@@ ks leads them on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until this point , the mur@@ ders have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , when on the same country , where the Lyn@@ ch Mor@@ de took place , the air feels sp@@ oo@@ ky . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if the final notes of the song sounds , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and in@@ spect the cor@@ p@@ se .
kids ho@@ cks on their heads , order the f@@ ake blood , and the breast@@ feeding body and whis@@ per@@ ing each other .
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; mur@@ m@@ urs a little boy , as he wants to remember .
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene thanks a lot - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw the Lyn@@ x rope away and wi@@ pe their tears .
Brad@@ sh@@ aw um@@ ar@@ mt Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in suit , who played the C@@ lan@@ tern .
Nick Ras@@ con@@ a embra@@ ces two of his players and then breaks up in her arms , the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks out with him .
&quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; whis@@ pers a woman .
&quot; we know that this is not in your heart .
you did this for a reason . &quot;
later , the audience put together the actors together with the actors .
at one table , a white pair met from Atlanta inspired by a black couple who just got to know them .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski fought to find words which left the performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... to come from people who look like you and those that do as you like , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what that really does with me makes me believe that the Lyn@@ x continues to pass on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today it is called the Police shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room , Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks holds the courtyard at his table , he e@@ ats and rec@@ alls the civil rights .
he said he started to plan the performance next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the post@@ pon@@ ement is inspiring because it describes the terror of what we bear , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is like we can &apos;t learn from it , then it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he who does not study his own story , who does not know his own story , is condemned to repeat them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Gö@@ tter@@ d@@ ämmer@@ ung &quot; reconc@@ iled the Wag@@ n@@ eri@@ ans in Bayreuth
also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s mon@@ umental work director Frank Cast@@ orf met a colorful @-@ fri@@ vol@@ e production in front of gigantic , six @-@ story back@@ drop .
the swivel stage ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) shows a sh@@ ab@@ t street corner with mas@@ on@@ ry and d@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pl@@ aste and El@@ aste &quot; logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange .
previously a open Mercedes classic car , in which the Rhein@@ sl@@ alom was po@@ uring in as Rock@@ erg@@ ir@@ ls , or an alternative to Is@@ etta .

brutal the scene , when he has fri@@ ghtened Siegfried .
later Gun@@ ther ( Markus oak ) still has to believe .
the audience thanks the ensemble with strong applause .
stor@@ my , Foster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski , who is humble and forming his hands to the Merkel rob@@ ber@@ ed .
big applause is for the Festival Orchestra , which shows the first time on stage - in view of the large heat back in allo@@ ys leisure clothes .
the appearance of Frank Cast@@ orf and his director was expected to come with excitement .
in 2013 , he had to leave a striking flute concert for himself in 2013 , five years later , in which the single &quot; bu@@ h &quot; calls were under@@ going .
Katharina Wagner is likely to have looked forward to this .
&quot; one noted that the audience has grown together with the &quot; Ring &quot; in a certain way , &quot; she had said shortly before the d@@ pa show .
the audience had not only made a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it was also an understanding of how it has grown .
I draw a positive result .
max amount works as a volunteer
they work at several sites in their volunteers .
where everywhere ?
a lot : normally in Stein@@ furt in the Furniture Exchange , once a week I help here in Gre@@ ven at the furniture bridge .
and I worked at school already in open full@@ time .
how are your experiences yet ?
crowd : it is a beautiful , wide spectrum that I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
you are now 26 years , thus a late volunteer volunteer .
how does it come ?
a lot : I did a school .
and then a construction engineer , let &apos;s say that successful .
I knew that it is wrong for me and I want to make something different with people .
and then I asked what you are doing .
do a social year , there is a glimpse of it , there you can see how it is on site , in the focal point maybe , really is .
and was it like that ?
crowd : I have collected great impressions .
I will start my academic studies in the winter semester .
I will study two , probably in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne a social worker and study in Ham@@ m at the university of Applied Sciences .
is it not unusual to have several different fields of use during the volunteer work ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
it always depends on where to make his FS@@ J .
you can make it from the al@@ ms to youth work - in all possible fac@@ ets of social work .
with me it was very varied .
I was also partly in the O@@ gs , so in the afternoon care .
for me it was the right thing that swe@@ ats me .
I could see and see my own strengths and how it really runs .
other than in civil engineering ?
quantity : well , here it &apos;s not about to calculate st@@ ati@@ ques .
you have always got other people &apos;s head , which each have a different story behind them .
whether a refugee , whether a youth , has been re@@ covering from the family - you have to always go individually .
very interesting .
and you didn &apos;t have any reservation ?
crowd : I &apos;m not the guy .
it is an area that gives a lot .
much Love , Much kindness .
there are also negative moments , but that &apos;s how life is .
Pear@@ son is a further 3.000 jobs and short@@ ens the dividend to revi@@ ve the business
the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday , she will cut further 3,000 jobs and cut its intermediate divide by 72 percent since another restructuring programme will be launched to overcome the pressure with which the company was confron@@ ted .
the job mining , General Director John Fall@@ on , mainly announced in late 2018 and early 2019 , comes in addition to its previous restructuring , which had lost 4,000 points .
Pear@@ son announced in May in a third cost of cost reduction by another 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) to revi@@ ve a business , which was taken by rapid pace for digital learning .
the company reported his participation in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House at the Ber@@ tel@@ smann partner last month , said that the outlook for the business year is unchanged , having achieved an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds .
con@@ voy of Kabul : NATO soldiers killed in suicide bom@@ ber
a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ voy in the Afghan capital Kabul , killing a soldier of Nato and injured several others , officials say .
five soldiers and an interpre@@ ter have been viol@@ ated , an explanation of Nato shared .
un@@ confirmed local reports according to the incident in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h district died also three civilians .
the bombar@@ d@@ ment is the last violence that hit Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday over 30 people were killed in a mosque in Her@@ at .
on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a opinion of Nato , the explosion was done on Thursday evening when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afghan army has been attacked by a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funded explosive device &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the asser@@ tion says that all injured in a stable condition are located and treated in the U.S. military hospital on the air@@ field of Bag@@ ram .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and group , known as so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h , is a major concern for NATO troops in nearby Bag@@ ram .
according to the United Nations in Afghanistan , there was at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % in the capital .
at the end of July a suicide auto@@ cla@@ ve killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shi@@ ite district of Kabul .
the Taliban said they would have done this attack .
on 31 May , a massive bom@@ b@@ ings killed in the centre of the city more than 150 people with the deadly milit@@ ant attack in the country , since the U.S. guided troops entered the power of power in 2001 .
the violence under@@ scores the prec@@ ari@@ ous security situation in Afghanistan , since U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump is considering to increase the number of US troops to increase the military and police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say that the suicide bom@@ bers in Kabul is also a crisis of public confidence in the government , their policy and especially in the reputation of President Ash@@ raf G@@ hani .
EPA returns to deci@@ ding the smo@@ g rule to cl@@ agen to delay
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has a decision to delay the government of Obama to delay the states that the states are obliged to con@@ strain the Smo@@ g @-@ induced emissions . this was a day after 15 countries accused the agency because of the step@@ per .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to drive the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oz@@ on@@ Rules 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and said they show the commitment of the agency to cooperate with states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue with and remember that we respond to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA Chief Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intention of EPA to establish the o@@ zone rules in June - in which part of the country &apos;s poll@@ ut@@ ant emissions are to be determined to specify where inc@@ isions have to be made to delay more str@@ ingent air quality standards - to delay one year by October 2018 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a group of 15 largely democratic states , together with the District of Colombia , filed an appeal on Tuesday , and said that the effort was illegal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to raise a broad range of environmental issues that the former President Barack Obama has imposed on economic growth according to Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , efforts have caused the set@@ backs of demo@@ cr@@ ats and reserves , which are concerned about the effects of larger emissions to public health .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA website says that the inhal@@ ation of air , the o@@ zone contains &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lung function &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and rein@@ force respir@@ atory symptoms &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like asthma . &quot; &quot; &quot;
communal wants common room
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end , the decision was clear : in two oppos@@ ites , the Municipal Council decides to set up the establishment of a community space in the future senior community . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is an important information before the discussion : the purchase agreement for the missing base part is signed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ adas reports . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although there will be still , until the church community is owned by the church , but there is no planning event for the project to become a private investor .
there is a discussion about a common room .
one of the two investors still in the boat , offered to meet the church .
on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - approximately 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a total of 70 square metres of space for a special price .
the administration and the majority of the council ad@@ mits that such a common room is not just as meeting place just for the residents of the sen@@ i@@ or@@ ative residence , but open to the community .
for example , the word of the &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; made the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do the decision will be decided by providing the provision for the ongoing household to the ongoing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last autumn &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through funding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the construction is located in the san@@ itation area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the establishment of a community room would be , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says T@@ j@@ adas , with 60 percent of 30 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision to indicate that there is no b@@ ill@@ ets in this respect , that one has no b@@ ill@@ ets between legs , and that in this regard - as well as P@@ ult@@ d@@ ach - as well as P@@ ult@@ d@@ ach - what the tr@@ auf@@ height reduces and the construction makes it possible .
need@@ less , so not only Wil@@ fried S@@ oh@@ mer is the addition .
if it helps : unanim@@ ously , he happens the body .
not so easy it goes with the common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Daniela Ruf refers to the many own buildings with which you don &apos;t get so much ahead , but now in the common room from the window , she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m seriously doing so . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger is responsible for the common room - but absolutely against a communist participation .
it looks behind a conce@@ aled payout of intellectual or even foreign investors .
that is not the case , because with the acquisition of the surface you don &apos;t give a supplement , but receive a real , in doubt that will be tra@@ dable in doubt , is the counter speech .
Sta@@ ig@@ ner request , the decision to apply accordingly , there are three advoc@@ ates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so it stays with two oppos@@ ites in the original program called Stefan H@@ aller : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when we gras@@ p the decision , we make a huge step in our infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most important point is balance in the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last was not good . &quot;
but the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official must of the season .
&quot; football is also tac@@ tic , strategy , personality and motivation .
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the team is ready .
we want to play smart , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who is a &quot; difficult , intensive game . &quot;
the duo of the two German football heav@@ y@@ weights attracts the fans in their spell .
the game is sold out with 8@@ 1.@@ 360 spectators , the German soccer league ( DF@@ L ) announced on Friday .
in the har@@ p of star to star
in Har@@ z , the world &apos;s first &quot; star path &quot; should arise .
this is planning for the ob@@ servatory Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a planet route in Göttingen , since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; come to the need of many res@@ ellers , called it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he connect nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic performance .
the members want to provide information along the planned route and inform about stars and stars .
during the first phase to 2018 , the association &quot; well @-@ achie@@ vable installations at five to six locations &quot; is planned in the Ober@@ har@@ z .
In@@ quire St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Ho@@ he@@ ge@@ i@@ ß and Sie@@ ber .
the information on the tables shall be supple@@ mented by Internet .
this is why a good mobile reception can play a role in the location selection .
acc@@ essibility is a crit@@ eri@@ on .
later the star path should be extended by train .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the star@@ path , the viewer will learn a lot of knowledge , for example on the physics of the individual stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated the association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they also learned why stars could have different colors , or why a star has more light than another , although he is much further away .
medi@@ ates also , in which constellation can be found a selected star and when he was best to see .
the association has been operating since 2014 in the town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , the highest located in Northern Germany .
the site is located in the middle of the Har@@ z National Park according to information from the Federal Office for Nature Conservation to the six dar@@ k@@ est regions in Germany .
from there , the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ me@@ da galaxy are often clearly visible with the naked eye .
in the university town , since 2003 it has been an initiative of Planet@@ arium Göttingen initiative , something similar to the planned star@@ base - the planet route .
beginning before Geb@@ har@@ ds Hotel in Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planetary path@@ way leads up to Hain@@ berg and the ob@@ servatory - as well as a &quot; ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ restri@@ al site in Di@@ em@@ ards ( Community Glei@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the st@@ alls with the individual planets - including the d@@ warf pl@@ uss@@ ed Plu@@ to at the end point - are precisely positioned at the distance and scale of one to two billions .
the earth shr@@ inks so on a sco@@ op of 6.5 mm in diameter , while the sun measures exactly 75 meters ( 70 cen@@ tim@@ eters ) .
the entire distance of the planet is about four kilometers .
during the light from Sun to Plu@@ to about eight hours , pede@@ stri@@ ans need a good hour to the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to .
pede@@ stri@@ ans are quicker than light in the cos@@ mos .
the march to the next fixation would take another half a year .
Mi@@ key Garcia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time , discuss a possible show@@ down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mi@@ key Garcia in a coll@@ ision course should be staged in order to be staged in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Garcia , the defeated World Boxing Council Ligh@@ tweight Champion , the corridor desc@@ ending to greet Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Boxing Organisation Super Feder@@ er Champion .
after Gar@@ ci@@ as victory by unanim@@ ous decision on the former four @-@ divisions of Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time , both fighters were members of the top five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und list .
Garcia stretched out the right hand and said : &quot; how are you , champion ?
I wish you good luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7 pm on ES@@ PN .
when the pair posed for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko faces Eg@@ is Kli@@ ma , that a possible show@@ down between the fighters that would be the &quot; perfect order . &quot;
&quot; I am a former fe@@ at weight , &quot; remembered Garcia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I grew up for Bron@@ zer &#91; at 140 lbs &#93; , but I &apos;m not so big . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m small for 140 .
I want to come down on light weight .
and he has to move to light weight &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
that demand the fans .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko agreed .
&quot; boxing needs this fight . &quot;
clients asked whether it should be on Pay @-@ per @-@ View , part of a strategy that must fight Lom@@ ach@@ enko with a 135 pound debut this year to arrange a date ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who also strug@@ gled in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Campbell in the forum on 23 September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this battle could be held in pay @-@ per @-@ View mode because all fans have asked him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Garcia and pressed later to fight with the network that offers the best financial package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can create this kind of attention .
when always they are ready ... &quot;
Garcia said he treasure Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; a huge fighter , &quot; and he may participate in his Saturday fight .
but Lom@@ ach@@ enko held his praise for Garcia in the generous praise for Garcia and said that he thinks , the three campaign champion made from River@@ side , &quot; I &apos;m tired of Mi@@ key ... you wanted to do the Ko @-@ Off . &quot;
Garcia said , the focus was to show impact strength , then boxing .
both said they could feel the momentum that raised up for his own struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the fight that needs to be performed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am more than happy to work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Garcia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko said , &quot; I waited for the top fighters , and that is Mi@@ key .
it will be a great fight . &quot;
four injured after tire plat@@ ters
on Thursday afternoon , four people were injured as part of an accident on the A7 .
after first information , the driver of a Opel Z@@ af@@ ira lost its position shortly before the connecting station , presumably to a tire plat@@ ter to be control over his vehicle .
the car tow@@ ed to the right into the bu@@ cks , where he ski@@ pped himself , and then remained on the roof .
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were severely injured during the accident .
while the first care of the injured service was closed the A7 toward the north for about an hour , then traffic was resolved on the left side of the accident at the accident site .
Fort@@ unas Hoffmann : &quot; turning the chain better &quot;
Andre Hoffmann , hopes for the 2 : 2 season open@@ er to Braunschweig that optimi@@ zes the optimization of the def@@ ensive information in Au@@ e points .
with the first season of the season , Andre Hoffmann was happy with the result , they would not have been the two opponents at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two opponents too much , and we have to fit better in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the def@@ ensive player of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Erz@@ gebirge , the rotating chain is to be optimised .
and a gate after a free spins don &apos;t want to cap@@ itali@@ ze anymore .
&quot; for the future , there will be no more besides Michael ( R@@ ensing ) to the line . &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team is even better right after the experience in preparation with the thresh@@ ing chain than with the qu@@ anti@@ qu@@ ette .
&quot; I don &apos;t know how we will act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is certain of his cause , &quot; because we are just in the tri@@ angular chain on the half @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and N@@ iko Gie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann players who can build well , &quot; Hoffmann said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pre@@ mise is , but that we do not harmon@@ ise even better and we are not able to make up so many play@@ able errors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course Hoffmann goes to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if one cannot talk about a mis@@ sil@@ ly start , you do not know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the performance could be quite okay , &quot; Hoffmann said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if we can stand on Sunday with four points , we will certainly be able to concentrate on the cup of season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his trainer didn &apos;t want to know anything about it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after six to eight days of playing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who would not like to speak from an advantage over Au@@ e , just because the game of Saxony is pre@@ mat@@ urely due to a we@@ ather@@ proof . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they can start the season quasi with a home game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann said that players from Au@@ e may even be a bit of fresh , as they wouldn &apos;t have a serious and complete game like Fort@@ una for Ascension . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but they do not know that 100 percent where they are currently standing , &quot; says the Interior of Fort@@ una .
guests arriving from the Rhin@@ eland as a slight favourite rest on Sunday in the En@@ counter ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we kill them , just because we have the claim under the first six is bull@@ sh@@ it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance sheet is quite positive at only a defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team in the 2nd league that has to strike from before@@ hand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Fort@@ una Head coach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; such a statement would be arro@@ gant and arro@@ gant . &quot;
and so Funk@@ el will not experience his players on Sunday .
new results of the Swedish asylum application tests published
the latest results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , which were subjected to a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested people are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish Association of For@@ ens@@ ische Medizin ( Rid@@ ts@@ ar@@ ket Rev@@ ket ) has begun with the performance of tests last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they should make more accurate during the asylum proceedings , after the Swedish Mig@@ ration@@ ing Authority ( Mig@@ ration@@ alize ) because of the assessment of the correct age of some refugees were critic@@ ised . &quot; &quot; &quot;
until today , Mig@@ r@@ ations@@ ver@@ ket 6.@@ 880 has been sent out and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 .
eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , while in further 25 cases For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency approved that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person is &quot; possibly under 18 years old . &quot;
tests will only be carried out in cases where the person &apos;s age is question@@ ed .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson , by the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are permanent during the past months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see no big difference in the statistics of the past months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the magazine The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high proportion of cases in which the person has been judged as over 18 years , does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ ers has lied about his age .
in May , the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that it was 4@@ 42 cases , which propos@@ e to be 18 years or older . &quot;
when the newspaper S@@ ven@@ ska Dag@@ bl@@ adet susp@@ ects the 5@@ 81 results , she noted that in 243 these cases the person had said frank@@ ly that it will be 18 years old .
the method of medical age assessment carried out in the X @-@ rays of the law @-@ teeth and MRI recordings of knee @-@ c@@ els , which are analyzed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , was critic@@ ized in some areas .
one scep@@ tics is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus des Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute , whose work occupies the assessment of biological maturity of people to see if they were used earlier or later than the pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had reason to think about it and I do not think that the type of measurement should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the biological age to assess this way is very uns@@ afe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we cannot say it safely , we should not do as if we could , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the newspaper Metro . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Gö@@ ran@@ sson , by the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , however , defended the accuracy of tests : &quot; generally , you can say that the risk to judge a child as an adult is low .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest risk is when the person is under 18 , in this case , this case is approximately 10 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
full in the Plan
the works on the three bridges of the Land@@ straße 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are progres@@ sing well .
on Wednesday , a seven tons of concrete was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very good at the time , it &apos;s going great , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reinhold Lei@@ cht , director at the road traffic and traffic in the Regierung@@ sprä@@ si@@ dium Freiburg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in April , the works began at the same time at all three san@@ iti@@ able bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the building is planned for October and is sure that the schedule is maintained .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads across the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a v@@ aul@@ ted bridge made of concrete , covered with Red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4,@@ 80 meters .
it was built in the year 1900 .
like the two other bridges , it has now come to the years .
in order to ensure the stability and transport safety , the three buildings are thoroughly sof@@ ten@@ ed .
the two other bridges run across the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built of Red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were erected in 1939 and are twelve , or 10,@@ 60 meters long .
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach now has a 1.@@ 30 meter wide and seven tons heavy so @-@ called ro@@ cking cap on Wednesday morning .
this is a mar@@ g@@ ation that is also used as an operating path .
on Friday , a 2.@@ 20 meter wide bridge cap should be used on Friday .
then the pedestrian wal@@ k@@ way shall go .
the special thing is that it is finished by finished parts , a patent from the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges are already fitted with the patented bri@@ ck@@ caps .
a special touch of finger has the laying of pipes required by the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
a glass fibre cable , where many companies are connected .
local residents were informed about the project in the run @-@ up of the work .
in addition , fish and canc@@ ers had to be wi@@ ped out .
for the bridges between the building yard and the collective in direction Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic lane is controlled by a traffic light .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for construction work on the bridge at Lau@@ ter@@ bach , the road is closed in the area of the bridge at the height of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tann@@ en@@ hof &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hotel and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost of three frac@@ tures amounts to 700 000 Euro .
the whole thing is financed by the country .
AF@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ lower Protest with German potato salad
it &apos;s not so common that parties go on a strand , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( AF@@ D ) , what else is difficult to put under a hat .
the grounds belonging to the volcano erup@@ tion party ( CDU , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Lin@@ ke ) belong to a broad alliance , that is peaceful on this day because the AF@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stadthalle Ron@@ dell invites a poster to the &quot; Great Choice Cerem@@ ony . &quot;
and known names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land forms the top duo for the parliamentary elections on September 24 , and the deputy chief artist Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
but those who are already on site before the start of the event , do not want to listen to AF@@ D voters but demonstrate .
the motto &quot; The Eifel remains colorful . &quot;
originally the town picnic was held under the slogan &quot; All at a table &quot; on the Brun@@ nen@@ platz , but now on the parking below the Ron@@ d@@ ells - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the AF@@ D event in the Stadthalle .
a colourful image that offers itself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , chair of the forum An world and one of the greatest organis@@ ers , is pleased : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great , how many people came together here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are music and lots of food , including a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her@@ ent potato salad that could also eat the AF@@ D &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the woman who brought him back . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police gave many civil servants to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence mainly in the railway station , which is only a few meters away from the venues .
how did the AF@@ D come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes reported by the AF@@ D volcanic stone , he tried to get such an event and received the surcharge .
the 45 year old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had arrived in Dau@@ n at first , but there was a cancellation because of the already built Lau@@ ren@@ ti@@ us@@ kir@@ ch not enough parking spaces available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so the Ron@@ dell , Hom@@ pes is pleased that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with a view of the event on the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ an@@ platz he says : &quot; this is the good right of the people , main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot;
this also does : at 20 o &apos;clock a band for entertainment takes place on the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ an@@ platz a band for entertainment , in the Stadthalle several speakers , among them the rh@@ ag@@ in@@ ese AF@@ D chair@@ woman Uwe Young .
there are about 200 list@@ eners in the hall that the top candidate for the German elections , Alice Wei@@ del , and the deputy president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch are keeping their spe@@ e@@ ches .
the police station remains unchanged , but so far the officials had a peaceful evening .
a little more than one hour lasts the AF@@ D event , the guests at the fore@@ court have a longer breath but also there is a short trip there shortly after 21 o &apos;clock .
the police can shut down - no special inci@@ dents .
trumpet hits trumpet
a resur@@ gence with the Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ aun@@ ist Freder@@ ic B@@ elli , there will be a series of Has@@ l@@ acher Kloster@@ concerts tomorrow , Sunday , at 8 o &apos;clock in the monastery church .
together with Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ro@@ sla@@ v Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the slogan &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest , &quot; or &quot; Bal@@ kan@@ fol@@ klore &quot; meets classical German training with roots in brass music .
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and solo@@ ists in European nick@@ ers .
thus Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is the renowned concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is the SWR Symphony Orchestra .
both combines the desire , not only the boundaries to cross their instruments , but also f@@ use the limits of different gen@@ res .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so Johann Sebastian Bach will sound like in a new look , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; world music &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; combines with Bulgarian fol@@ klore , and in piece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; combines classic , jazz and the free playing for a fascinating art work . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this core of the programme was first performed in Freiburg with huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram has written it specifically for both musicians and more : the Has@@ l@@ acher Kloster@@ kirche with its special acou@@ st@@ ics will be consci@@ ously included in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Stewart talks about their bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives .
but I want to try everything , &quot; Kri@@ sten Stewart completely openly about their bis@@ exu@@ ality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I bite in grilled cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what comes next ? &apos; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the probably best known relationship of Hollywood star was the &quot; T@@ wi@@ light &quot; colleague Robert Patt@@ inson , who ultimately worked bitter .
despite all the brunette Dar@@ stell@@ erin is insured against the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s B@@ az@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I was in love with everyone , whom I dat@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; or do you believe , I have played it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after their separation , Kri@@ sten was saying that she was bis@@ ex@@ ual : &quot; I have always lived the du@@ alism and believed seriously .
so it has never been confused or hin@@ dered me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I never liked it , not being taken seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but in particular , she suffered from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bang Show@@ biz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in school @-@ time when she said like a boy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that really hurt me .
when I was eleven told me the kids , I would look like a Bu@@ b .
I felt really attacked , fri@@ ghtened and ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now I look back and think me : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; girls , be proud of you ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially the public , they would not like to live their love life : &quot; people expect you to a certain way and that anno@@ ys me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps some call me to be un@@ grateful but I don &apos;t like to justify the whole public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the governor of West Virginia is announ@@ cing that he changes the party
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Democratic Governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday night at a rally with President Tr@@ ump that he will change the party . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether you like it or not , the demo@@ cr@@ ats have removed from me , &quot; said governor Justice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and much thinking ... today I will tell you as inhabitants of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you if I am a democratic Governor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rally collapsed in singing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the rep@@ ublic@@ ans , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as a coach , I would say it is time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised a big announcement at West Virginia Rally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not appro@@ ve the democratic candidate Hillary Clinton .
justice , according to For@@ bes , the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes declar@@ es that he has coal mines in five states and has inherited a coal business from his father .
it is worth about 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , the Republi@@ can National Committee announced an explanation in which it said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Party change of Governor Justice is another blow for a democratic party that would rather prevent us than to make our country great again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with only 15 Gou@@ vern@@ ements and the control of the fe@@ west laws in history , the announcement of Governor Justice is only the last re@@ jection of a party , which is not able to find a positive , agreed message , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the R@@ NC chair R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of the C@@ BS News . &quot; &quot; &quot;
CO@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; honest &quot; Russian ap@@ ology for d@@ oping sc@@ andal
the global leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious excuse for Russia to a d@@ oping sc@@ andal , but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be resumed in the sport .
Russia &apos;s athle@@ tics boss Dmit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ ak@@ ht@@ in said during the IA@@ AF congress on the eve of the athle@@ tics world championships , that the exile of his country was correct , and that he was determined to fight the d@@ oping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all athletes who were s@@ nat@@ ched with competitions gold and silver medals &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress approved in November 2015 , after a report of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) has found evidence of state @-@ funded d@@ oping in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was a very open answer , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e the Rep@@ orters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entire council and the entire congress were pleased that the Russian Federation is aware that they have seen some fairly hot times and everything will do to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; CO@@ E said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is also pleased , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for its re@@ introduction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think that progress has been achieved , but Congress supports the recommendations of Task Force , that this is not the moment to use Russia again , &quot; Co@@ e said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athl@@ ets from the de@@ pra@@ ved system , &quot; he added
nin@@ ete@@ en Russian athletes will begin at the athle@@ tics world championships , which begin in London on Friday , according to the strict IA@@ AF criteria .
the head of the IA@@ AF task force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia will still fulfill some of the criteria for a revival .
&quot; &quot; &quot; threats are still in@@ adequate and forbidden trainer are still free , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said Rep@@ orters in London after a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
fun@@ eral for Mali abbrevi@@ ated soldiers
in a fun@@ eral service at the North H@@ ess@@ ische Frit@@ z@@ lar , around 1000 people of the two have thought of a helicopter crash in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the dom@@ stadt under high safety precau@@ tions .
the Minister of Defense Minister Ursula from the Le@@ yen ( CDU ) , Minister Ursula , said nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but they described the two inver@@ ted pilots but as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; host of their professional . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow down before this highest victims , which they made in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and 47 @-@ year @-@ old Stab@@ ili@@ pt@@ mann from Nord@@ h@@ essen came to life on Wednesday one week in the West African Mali .
her bud@@ dies were transferred to Germany and accompanied by a dead guard of the Bundes@@ wehr in the Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er cathedral Sankt Peter .
at noon , only the members of the church were part@@ ing at the end of the church .
afterwards , the fun@@ eral in the circle of family , eng@@ ages friends , from representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr , and politics .
among them were H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CDU ) and the general inspec@@ tor of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wie@@ ker .
bare ro@@ ses down , the families of his arm were arm in his arm in arms .
before the church , Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the minister of defence by the Le@@ yen called the inver@@ ted soldiers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the general manager was built to the flight operations of the combat helicopter Tiger in Frit@@ z@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tig@@ ers of his regim@@ ents .
even Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , commander of the regim@@ ents , to which the soldiers belong , said : &quot; if this crew could not turn off the crash , there would be no one . &quot;
doubts about the UN mission in Mali did not show the minister by the Le@@ yen : the commitment is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he is also of high meaning &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country by which we are separated by two countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the fun@@ eral , the sl@@ ats were brought out of the cathedral .
when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not make any information .
Prince Hen@@ rik wants no tomb beside his wife
the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , wants to be buried in his wife after his death .
that shared the royal house on Thursday .
traditionally , the Danish royal couple is buried in the cathedral of Ros@@ kil@@ de .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ gaard already used a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ agus for the two .
the Queen of her husband agree with the decision of her husband , named it further in the message .
where Prinz Hen@@ rik is buried , be still un@@ clear .
but he did not int@@ end to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik never had a H@@ eh@@ l that he was not happy with his title .
after the thr@@ ott@@ ling of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 he would like to be king .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2016 he retired and also retired the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prin@@ cipl@@ ed &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; since Hen@@ rik didn &apos;t get the title and the function he wanted to see himself as equivalent to his wife - not after death , LE@@ NE B@@ alle@@ by , the chief spokes@@ woman of the Danish king &apos;s house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will eventually be , is still un@@ clear .
but he did not int@@ end to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark .
he likes the country for which he worked for the last 50 years .
born in 1965 in London , Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , the son of a French citizen , was born in London .
on the Th@@ ames he worked in the French Embassy .
during his later woman the sympath@@ ies of the people always flew , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand for the Dan@@ es in his almost 50 years of government .
in a auto@@ biography Hen@@ rik about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did .
my Danish was sw@@ inging , I prefer wine instead of beer , soap stum@@ ps instead of kn@@ it@@ so@@ cks , Citro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ rolog@@ ists I smo@@ ked in instead of Virginia tobacco and who had to be a reputation to be the brand of social @-@ critical intellec@@ tu@@ als , I could not hope for indul@@ gence .
I was different .
I seemed happy to be satisfied with this position and not to be ashamed .
these were just two mistakes ! &quot;
Prime Minister Weil wants rapid re@@ election
CDU and F@@ DP in front of a possible majority in Lower Saxony
the prime minister of the Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) is after the loss of red @-@ green government majority for a rapid re@@ election of the country , but he does not want to come back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because on Friday , he spoke out of the Parliament &apos;s resolution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
previously , the surprising exit of a green de@@ pu@@ ties from their land fra@@ ction in Lower Saxony had reduced the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) into a severe crisis .
five months before the official appointment of the European elections , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its short@@ age in parliament to the opposition from the CDU and F@@ DP .
the old Green @-@ MEP El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests founded their step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 election in its const@@ itu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( W@@ ü@@ m@@ me ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see my political future in the CDU , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she declared on Friday in Hannover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CDU faction of Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler intends to recommend it to his group .
thus CDU and F@@ DP had 69 seats in the Lower Sax@@ on Parliament , the SPD and the Green 68 seats .
so far , the relationship was revers@@ ed .
the new day of land will be re @-@ elected on 14th January of the year .
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said that the red @-@ green government government has now decided whether they could continue to gover@@ n in this situation without a majority .
Stephan Weil , however , believes it is indispensable that the country &apos;s country decides quickly as quickly as possible .
the CDU faction is expected to decide on her further notice on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the state can also see the possibility that the country &apos;s Parliament will elect the trust and choose a successor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; our constitution offers several options .
these options must be fully checked properly , &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will answer all questions in peace if they are legally reasonable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called T@@ west@@ ens step &quot; but something strange . &quot;
the polit@@ ician himself stressed : &quot; I am no tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
she signed as a winner of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens demanded the de@@ pu@@ ties to return the country of land .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we go , of course , that they have received their land list with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shared with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; distributed the presi@@ dents Meta Janssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner with immediate effect . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Group president of the Green Anja PI@@ EL said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are regre@@ t@@ ted the decision of El@@ ke T@@ ets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she deliber@@ ately decided to lead no pron@@ unci@@ ation in the faction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also before the background , there were no clu@@ ded differences , we cannot understand this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the SPD chan@@ cell@@ or candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the Lower Saxony @-@ President El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests for the CDU as a betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behaviour of the former green de@@ pu@@ ties in Lower Saxony is not only a betra@@ yal of the voters , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the Federal President of the Socialists and Democrats on Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he supports the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) to re @-@ elect the country &apos;s country quickly .
the exit T@@ west@@ ens costs Red @-@ green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the political woman &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in their last vanity and their personal interests in the presence of the country &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; critic@@ ized SPD @-@ Secretary @-@ General Hu@@ ber@@ tus Salv@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a sc@@ andal that makes the CDU in Lower Saxony this dirty in@@ filtr@@ ation game and tries to strike the political capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CDU faction of the CDU faction of Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler intends to recommend to accept his de@@ pu@@ ties , El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests in the CDU .
the President of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , threw T@@ v@@ ests before , with personal career thinking the result of the 2013 Land@@ ing Code .
the CDU was strongest in the SPD at that time , the SPD and the Green had a very thin majority in the country &apos;s day .
the Minister of Agriculture in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from tox@@ ic@@ ers , Mr. Schmidt ?
Germany is discuss@@ ing about contam@@ inated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal pass ?
how can consumers protect themselves .
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) stands in an interview with the Federal Ministry of Technology Germany ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer .
Mr. Schmidt , How can the consumer protect yourself from pois@@ oned eggs ?
I can only encourage consumers in your refrigerator to watch the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp print .
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ food war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the federal states provide the most recent information on the affected eggs bat@@ ches .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if according to all we currently know , health haz@@ ard is practically excluded .
now Al@@ di now takes over the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the clari@@ fier is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture ?
the food monitoring is the task of the Länder .
nevertheless , my house has been immediately suspended and has since disclos@@ ure of Germany in close exchange with the authorities of the countries .
all information and risk assessment are available to consumers .
trading has the same as the manufacturers to ensure that the sold products are safe and safe .
if it is exceeded with eggs of the resi@@ due level of 0,@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg , these are not per@@ il@@ able .
un@@ loaded eggs can , however , be sold and consumed .
this time are not to blame .
are manufacturing companies and consumers at the same boat ?
according to the process of knowledge , the production companies do not meet immediate fault .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rather , they must be reck@@ oned with economic damages due to alleged illegal practices of service companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as always , there are too few Controll@@ ers in the appointment .
is it only missing on the staff or even at the conclu@@ sive jurisdiction ?
there were just the official controls which have uncovered the process .
for truth , however , food fraud and criminal energy can never be 100 percent excluded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; precisely therefore , a consistent recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance of such events and hand@@ over to the prosec@@ utor in those cases , in which off@@ ences cannot lie , of decisive importance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already made several times clear that I am expecting a complete recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance by the responsible authorities .
is regular alarm clock at food sc@@ and@@ als really necessary ?
consumers and consumers have the right to get exclusively safe and safe food .
if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ ci@@ de in the food industry is used , consumers and consumers are right to ou@@ tra@@ geous .
by the pan@@ de@@ fied resources , manufacturers , tra@@ ders and consumers are in a situation that is absolutely not necessary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; basically , it must be clear : the un@@ lawful use of insec@@ ti@@ ci@@ des Fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food @-@ borne animals is not acceptable and must be ended without delay . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this has to consistently be consistent with high pressure on all levels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I expect from all the competent authorities that the atomic fact is quickly and picked up . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how the foot@@ balls of the football on Ne@@ ym@@ ar move to Paris
the rules that aim to prevent un@@ hin@@ dered issues of European football matches , Ne@@ ym@@ ar world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain will not inter@@ fere .
any consequences will come to Paris Saint @-@ Germain from the UEFA , because the leading organisation which the European game has super@@ vised the power , teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial Fair @-@ Play rules , which have been launched in 2011 by the UEFA , signi@@ fy that PS@@ G must show that the transfer from Ne@@ ym@@ ar was financed without great losses .
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ( 262 million $ ) to buy the Brazi@@ li@@ ans out of his contract , and Ne@@ ym@@ ar will receive a salary that will amount to several ten million dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of Ne@@ ym@@ ar &apos;s move to France .
PS@@ G can easily make money with security to make Ne@@ ym@@ ar and bring him into a galaxy other stars , given the financing of the team through the rich ruler family of Qatar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you may apply a lot of money for the acquisition of players , but must be used with legitim@@ ate sources of resources , which enable them the break @-@ even point in their business @-@ related business . &quot; &quot; &quot;
FF@@ P was conceived by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEFA president in 2007 .
the former French player believed that they had taken enormous debts in their quest for success , che@@ ating and ris@@ ked effectively when banks or owners re@@ signed their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P was expanding from concentr@@ ating on the debt of the clubs monitoring its losses .
the change meant that the business model , the novel Abr@@ am@@ ov@@ ich originally used in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily in order to improve the crew and build a global brand - become a harder issue .
during the current three @-@ year old FF@@ P period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can take losses of EUR 30 million .
and even though Plat@@ ini 2015 is fallen by the presidency in Un@@ gn@@ ade , his UEFA sequ@@ el Ale@@ ks@@ ander Ce@@ fer@@ in will continue to put off by excessive spending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surely the FF@@ P is not dead and we will certainly rein@@ force the rules for the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEFA for FF@@ P , compared to The Associated Press last week . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clau@@ se of Ne@@ ym@@ ar in a flat rate , it can distribute the amount for accounting over the duration of its contract .
Ne@@ ym@@ ar has signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the deposits for the next five years can be reported in the annual financial statements for the next five years .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 is the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the he@@ avi@@ est sanctions .
the PS@@ G received a fine of 60 million Euros ( then 82 million dollars ) , which later was lowered to 20 million euros , and it has been ordered that the teams for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players in the otherwise normal 25 players .
the UEFA is searching for clubs that might try to rev@@ ise their financial review by combining their income by companies that are linked to the owners of a club .
while a co @-@ Hungarian company would sponsor PS@@ G if the value of the sponsor@@ ing should exceed the default market rate , the UEFA does not apply as legitim@@ ate income .
exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the value of the sponsor@@ ing of the PSA by Qatar Tourism Authority has been exp@@ ens@@ ed .
it was reported that a part of the PS@@ G payments to Ne@@ ym@@ ar could be made on payments by the Organ@@ izing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 have argu@@ ed that Ne@@ ym@@ ar WM ambassador will become an ambassador and such a man@@ oeu@@ v@@ res for the UEFA Regulation authorities could just find out .
the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEFA will be more attentive to observe every attempt to circum@@ vent the rules .
the UEFA had no prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G on Ne@@ ym@@ ar Transfer , on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .
they spoke under the condition of anon@@ ym@@ ity with The Associated Press where they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the last reports published that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 showed a gain of more than € 10 million with a turnover of € 54@@ 2.4 million .
the accounts for the last financial year must still be published .
PS@@ G expects that Ne@@ ym@@ ar is a blessing for sponsor@@ ing deals , merchan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ cot purchases .
the association consists of that the sales will rise by at least 30 percent after signature .
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best soccer players , and she tried to prevent Ne@@ ym@@ ar &apos;s withdrawal by declar@@ ing that PS@@ G would viol@@ ate the FF@@ P .
&quot; it is a clear fall of &quot; financial &quot; d@@ oping &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the President of the La League , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Kat@@ ars the official owner of PS@@ G .
arsen@@ al @-@ manager Arsen@@ e Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American Sport @-@ Ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservation of the League against a State who financed a society .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of the owners and that completely changed the whole landscape of the football in the past 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; once a country has a club , everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will respect very difficult to respect the financial fair Fair@@ play because you can have different ways or have different interests , if a country has such a great player to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss is in search of a new sh@@ og@@ gi@@ ants
in recent years Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y aboard chocolate was made for the Swiss .
now the first collaboration is ahead of a possible end : the airline writes the contract new .
Swiss spokes@@ woman Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ p confirmed a report by the newspaper &quot; Nord@@ deutsche schwei@@ z &quot; on request of the news agency S@@ DA by Friday .
according to the current planning , Air@@ line will close a new contract during the first half of 2018 .
the products would be checked every two to three years and undergo a quality control .
&quot; we are very happy with the current suppliers Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; said the spokesperson .
around 17 million small red @-@ white stu@@ ffs up to 14 grams per year spread the flight companion in front of landing to the passengers .
Swiss does not want to make any information about the cost .
industry experts estimate the volume volume according to &quot; Nord@@ deutsche schwei@@ z &quot; at 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of about one billion Swiss francs .
but more import@@ antly the advertising effect : for a sh@@ og@@ gi@@ ver it is a prestigious order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how many applicants are there in the new call , Swiss will not betra@@ y the Swiss . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but only Swiss manufacturers come in question .
according to the newspaper article , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make a renewal of the treaty over spring 2018 .
for the S@@ DA , the biggest Swiss chocolate manufacturer could not be reached for a statement .
chocolate bars spread the Swiss since 2006 on board their flights .
before the Swiss concluded a contract with Mig@@ ros daughter , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut had delivered the chocolate tablets in cooperation with Hu@@ g .
the opportunity to place the logo was a two and a half years ago with the start of cooperation with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline works with different Swiss chocolate producers .
on long @-@ h@@ aul flights the customers of First Class with treats will be spoiled by the Con@@ fis@@ eria Spr@@ ün@@ gli , in Business Class n@@ ags passengers Sch@@ og@@ gi of Lind@@ t and in Economy Class Sch@@ og@@ gi of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
the short stretch also distri@@ butes Swiss Sch@@ og@@ gi of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , both in Business and Economy Class .

nost@@ algia goes into &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; in the niche
this repet@@ ition of history is nost@@ al@@ gic because of the glorious days of characters of the 80 @-@ s , and for himself - that is , for himself - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , such as Elizabeth B@@ anks , Amy Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Rud@@ d went to bigger things .
as a cultural ar@@ te@@ facts it is equally a par@@ ody and a em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ enabled era of permanent memories .
but as a fran@@ chise , it feels like the time would be scar@@ ce .
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; worked surprisingly well , not only because of its sur@@ sur@@ ge Hum@@ ors ( it contained a original story for a speaking can vegetables which was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .
by focusing on the core of the g@@ ags - actor middle ages play cool children , who will grow up - still create the im@@ possibility to win the final part of the W@@ itz@@ es .
&quot; Ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adult who are now playing adults is less emotion@@ ally rooted and his par@@ ody goes much more after the wat@@ ering can , among them one riff for the Stal@@ ker movies of the 90 @-@ year @-@ old like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the Cra@@ dle &quot; ( &quot; Die Hand That the Cra@@ dle &quot; ) .
at one point , a character generated by an Apple Power@@ book , some in@@ line sk@@ ates , and a number of other things from the year 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the lovely C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now Roman@@ aut@@ or , has not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ite Mo@@ reau ) .
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has still not lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there is another crazy @-@ mal@@ ign@@ ant plot that is included in the Ronald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) which is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
as always , the courses are the best part of fran@@ chise .
it makes very much fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Rud@@ d , who shows Matt D@@ illons sub@@ li@@ ce of &quot; Singles , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old b@@ acker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these are the moments of random mad@@ ness that this fran@@ chise could stop this fran@@ chise : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose last scene will show the gang &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon now reminds of a different kind of nost@@ algia : to the revival of the Cold War of &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even an &quot; G@@ low &quot; with its East @-@ West ring fight icon@@ ography .
the com@@ edy produced by Brian G@@ ate@@ wood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka , with R@@ hy@@ s Thomas , is a Romanian drama of eigh@@ ties with two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Bucharest , who fight for truth , a@@ the@@ ism and the way of Marx@@ ism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism .
the main controls - a hard ges@@ e Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i , whose dial@@ ogues from Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a detailed producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt can be synchron@@ ized in English .
it is a brilliant idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some beautiful g@@ ags for watching ( the police is spending time to watch chess on TV , how Americans may do it with football ) .
and the list of famous spokes@@ man including Jenny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Chlo@@ e Sev@@ ign@@ y - provides a decent play &apos; Fin@@ de &apos; voice .
but &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; is committed so much for the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desper@@ ate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer who carries a Re@@ agan mask is involved - that it often plays like a single one .
for six long episodes , it is gone , and the com@@ edy is not fast or frequent enough .
&quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective , &quot; who was re@@ acted on a lower length , could give its Ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p @-@ sati@@ re better , since Gregory and I@@ os@@ ef has always been able to visit the American Embassy whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who dev@@ our@@ ing a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the embassy for the imag@@ inary Communist audience is that Western culture can make everything a food for food . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fic@@ t@@ itious Romanian Creator is not wrong : we even do it with our own younger history and with the wi@@ dened .
strike against Drugs @-@ Mafia in the Land
the police managed a blow against the Italian Mafia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning , in the Black Forest @-@ B@@ aar , in Rot@@ tw@@ eil , Constance , and Stuttgart , numerous objects were searched , as the public prosec@@ utor was shared on Friday .
between the age of 25 and 77 he was arrested and issued an arrest warrant against them .
in addition , the officials put larger quantities of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms , and several hundred thousand Euros .
two people were arrested for the same razor in Italy .
there were German arrest warran@@ ts against the two susp@@ ects Itali@@ ans .
the two are therefore likely to be delivered to Germany .
the action was involved in Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators .
over 300 c@@ ops were in use .
the members of the Mafia will organized drug criminal , violent acts of violence , murder , and rob@@ bing .
since the summer of 2016 , the Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office was established against organised drug traff@@ icking in the South German area .
between the prosec@@ utor in Constance and Palermo there was a real exchange and investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ tw@@ eil had almost daily contacts with their colleagues on Sicily .
therefore , the major deployment on Wednesday morning was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the visor of the investigations , Italian nationals combined with respect to Italian m@@ af@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also an incident on May 27th in Hü@@ started , where several shots were fired at the morning at the early morning , is likely to go to the bank@@ roll account .
how many mos@@ quit@@ oes compl@@ ains in the fore@@ ig@@ ner tab@@ s
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data of citizens who should not appear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a report , the fore@@ ig@@ ner register in Germany has considerable short@@ com@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this lead to partly engraved patches with asylum procedures .
the contrac@@ tor for the refugee management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , has made attention to a media report according to major g@@ aps in the country &apos;s central register .
&quot; &quot; &quot; defects in the existing data may lead to asylum procedures and dep@@ ort@@ ations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to partly mis@@ leading mis@@ decisions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a way in an analysis that is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to its regist@@ ers , ten million people have been recorded with foreign nationality , including about 5.7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
the data is therefore managed by about 600 foreign countries in Germany .
because the data has not been maintained enough , the data quality has not been well @-@ kept in parts so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in single cases , data from 1921 has been found , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by people who have long been born blind , or citizens who have become German citizens and should not dive in the register . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; incorrect data entry can considerably slow down processes , &quot; said it to the report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; statistics about travel @-@ out people are covered by EU citizens who would not have to travel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but such mis@@ conception led to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a dis@@ rup@@ ting debate on dealing with trav@@ eller , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is said therefore in the analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the federal government has apparently begun to return refugee families with under 16 @-@ year @-@ old children to back to Italy when they arrived there .
this emerges from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , the &quot; Neue Osnab@@ rü@@ cker Newspaper . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the paper , it is said that BA@@ MF follows such procedures &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regarding families with children - with the exception of infants and small children - to Italy since June 1 , 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the end of 2014 , this was virtually no longer possible , the newspaper under reference to the difficult situation on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Dublin agreement , the EU state is responsible for refugees of the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a mig@@ rant travels to another EU country , this state can send him back to the immigration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the reason : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , the admission capacity for families with children in Italy has been considerably increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Italy have given guarantees for the recording and accommodation of family guarantees .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) stop these promises .
other EU countries would also send refugees in the context of the Dublin agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the domestic policy spokesperson on the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; families with children threatened due to the lack of human rights regarding human rights and a companion of child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
second best result achieved
a total of 220 litres of blood in Ober@@ rich@@ enbach living persons was already available for other people .
at least of the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday .
at all , Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who with his meanwhile 100 Don@@ ations now shared 50 litres of blood .
traditionally , the congregation in the council of the council provides multiple read@@ iness to don@@ ate blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is in@@ gen@@ ious how our body is laid out for this and we are den@@ d@@ ding respect for strangers which make their blood for foreigners , nor with it un@@ sel@@ fish , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a single blood sp@@ elling helps with several people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the circle head of the German Red Cross ( DRC ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , as the preser@@ ves are de@@ composed into their components . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , three persons could benefit from a bleeding benefit .
at the same time , Mais@@ enb@@ acher reported by the actions that are carried out in the spring of Ober@@ reich@@ enbach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year we achieved the second best result together with 114 don@@ keys , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the DR@@ K circle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously , the change in the theatre house had been reduced to higher participants only a few years ago .
before earlier , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Schö@@ ck , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Meta R@@ asp@@ berry were awarded to the multi@@ ples and have been awarded for 50 performed blood donations .
half as many promise Herbert M@@ air and Dor@@ othe@@ e Rie@@ x@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ ro@@ omy , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stef@@ anie St@@ oll and Uwe V@@ etter have given 500 milli@@ liters of their life juice .
the Bank of England will hold interest rates by 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to be announced later that the interest rates remain unchanged , after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation remained sub@@ du@@ ed over a rise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England has warned that economic growth will &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; remain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when she kept the interest rates in the middle of a reinforced pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank &apos;s policy makers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank voted to hold interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , with less members a rise in this month , as weak economic growth has weak@@ ened the support for an increase . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in its fourth annual inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7 % and expected to continue to 1.6 % in 2018 , and warning that inflation would continue to rise to almost 3 % in the autumn .
but she realized that in the next few years Zin@@ o@@ gens were necessary to grow inflation and they said that credit costs might be more than expected on the financial markets .
the members also voted to withdraw a part of the mamm@@ oth business package , which was issued before a year after the Bre@@ xit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will demand time for financial debt to provide cheap financial resources for banks , even though it was said that it is expected to be 15 billion pounds more in the context of this system - with 115 billions of ster@@ ling ster@@ ling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the central forecast of the M@@ PC , GDP will remain weak at short notice , because the pressure on the real@@ ities of households continue to reduce consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; to the interest rates , they repeated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a certain fir@@ ming of monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the cooling of inflation and a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bigger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extent is required when the markets are expecting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the markets currently predic@@ ts the first rise in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Bank stressed that increases &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gradu@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bank forecast for this and next year &apos;s down@@ ward growth forecast for this and next year , 1.9 % and 1.7 % predicted in May .
it has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell to these news from the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 Euro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision to no change comes after the recent disappoin@@ ting growth figures have d@@ amped increasing expectations and GDP in the second quarter of 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % . &quot; &quot; &quot;
growth is expected to lie at 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it is slightly absorbed by the bank at the end of the year .
the latest inflation report offered little enthusiasm for budgets , which will be affected by an increasing inflation and minor inci@@ dents , as the exac@@ erb@@ ation becomes even worse before it becomes better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that monetary policy in the next few years cannot prevent his income failure , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but she added that wages will be clearly to recover at the end of their thir@@ tieth year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods , which is due to weak pounds , which is compens@@ ated for a part of the lower consumption issues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision is made a year after lower@@ ing the interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % in the last August following the sho@@ cking EU vote , which caused the sin@@ king of the P@@ fun@@ des created . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will achieve the prices and the economy completely .
before the last judgment of the Bank on interest rates , the call for a interest margin was increased , since inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three political decision @-@ makers in July required a rise to 0,5 % .
inflation has dropped to 2.6 % in June last month , although the bank said that this was expected and will be able to attract them in the coming months .
the Bank said the su@@ peri@@ ority in relation to its target of 2 % is &quot; quite &quot; to the weak pounds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Andrew Mont@@ lake , director at Co@@ rec@@ o mort@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the recent delay of s@@ wap rates the mort@@ gage market is likely to be competitive again , as the credit@@ ors want to search for a positive way in a positive way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the market looks particularly well designed for those who complete the existing De@@ als and the new mort@@ g@@ ages , and many with extra free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) should rub the disp@@ uted HIV drug 10,000 people
&quot; &quot; &quot; patients will receive a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trans@@ forming &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; HIV pre@@ ventive treatment in September after a fight against the high Court &apos;s financing of the drug in N@@ HS . &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS England announced that one prior to the intercourse recorded pre@@ positi@@ onal phy@@ la@@ xes ( Pr@@ EP ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high risk premium costs about 86 percent , now being delivered by the first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people .
he was ready to finance the trial , after the Appeals Court confirmed the verdict of the Supreme Court , according to the N@@ HS , in spite of the claim that the N@@ HS had to pay for the claim that the local authorities should finance him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report announced on Thursday was awarded by N@@ HS England Chief Simon Stev@@ ens as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; important new intervention &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; while National AIDS Trust ( NAT ) described this as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; decisive moment &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ ghton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be first , and further clinics will follow in October before it will be imported into the whole of England in April 2018 .
pre@@ emin@@ ent phy@@ la@@ xes ( Pr@@ EP ) is a result of HIV medicine that can be taken before sex in order to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that Pr@@ EP significantly reduced the HIV transmission with infections at infections .
Pr@@ EP before sexual intercourse means that just enough medication in the body of a person are present to prevent an HIV infection .
such medicines can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse .
to those who come for the treatment in question are gay or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , trans@@ sexual and persons with HIV positive partners who were not treated successfully .
in clinics , suitable participants are identified , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy .
people who live in England and registered with a local doctor may also register for possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the program is estimated at £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply medications in this week after an international competitive proc@@ urement .
the study is intended to assess the whole potential of Pr@@ EP by evalu@@ ating clinical evidence as it is implemented and implemented in a large scale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Stev@@ ens said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; These big new intervention should add the far and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV and over@@ take HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in the more than three decades lasting progress in addressing of one of mankind &apos;s biggest health challenges . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Deborah Gold , Chief Executive at NAT ( National Aids Trust ) said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .
Pr@@ EP , if it is specifically focused on needy and endangered people , offers the possibility to change the English HIV epidemic .
from September to people with high HIV risk access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument , which will really be individually controlled and not with a negoti@@ ation with a partner is subject to improve many , many lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we warmly welcome this notice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ian Green , Chairman of the Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the priority must now be out that the study will soon be carried out throughout the country and that no one has left the risk for HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; now , as the Pr@@ EP testing medicine was proc@@ ured , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ infected people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sharon Hodg@@ son , shadow Minister of Health , said : &quot; the beginning of the Pr@@ EP process is welcome and over@@ due to the government after months of trial .
evidence shows how to transform this drug as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transfer of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to the understanding of the benefits of Pr@@ EP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible in the whole country to protect people who are infected with HIV and that they contribute to the end of the circulation of HIV in society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
life life : mezz@@ anine and smart designer tricks have transformed this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a spacious home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , resi@@ zed 2014 from a big house in Kn@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court apartment .
it is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it &apos;s a proof for the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed and sold her bags .
&quot; before that I lived with my ex in Kn@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much bigger space , &quot; says Jo@@ anne .
&quot; I searched for something that was comparable to my price .
I showed this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and it had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I fell in love with them and made an offer this day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot was completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ room estate with a ve@@ iled layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Jo@@ anne storage space and an mezz@@ anine to use the generous ceiling height optimal .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light .
that was my requirement , &quot; she says .
for this purpose she ordered the architecture and design studio Duck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Notting Hill to use 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home , not only a development , but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms , so that the architectural challenge was to create an mezz@@ anine in which you could stand .
Er@@ fan had to think creative thinking about the presentation .
&quot; the steel works is quite complicated , &quot; he explains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were st@@ acked on each other without having to decorate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was not only about building a simple platform , but put the steel so that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this order made it possible to place two rooms in full height - with lots of additional drama .
for the mezz@@ anine , a classic copper window of Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down over the glam@@ orous living area .
mir@@ ro@@ red gold furniture , silver acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program .
the use of mirrors plays a part when adding theatre , space and light .
at both ends a short corridor was mir@@ ro@@ red to make it longer work .
the kitchen feels like a window in a different room .
at the entrance , mir@@ ro@@ red units offer space for all the best and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
the beauty of a glam@@ orous space can close the beauty of the living room when it is not used .
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a gar@@ ret door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a little engineering of engineering &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Er@@ fan explains from the steel reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to be so important when you push the door highly , very easy to gli@@ de . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne could win an additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land area - or as your property is appreciated , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will occur and perform a calculation based on the floor size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here , they have made it to increase the floor area and at the same time use high @-@ quality materials that make space to the room its luxurious benefit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the materials are the things you touch and therefore help to create an emotional connection in a home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you do not love yourself in electrical outlets in the walls .
these are important , but they are not playing with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself into something completely different with good design and increased square meters .
in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave them .
brothers fight for a 500 million US real estate empire
two decades , after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a confron@@ tation because of one of the largest real estate in Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as , worth over $ 500 million .
the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton Football Club &apos; and developers Colin De Lut@@ is lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , just three doors from his younger brother Paul , who has brought him to the Supreme Court to clari@@ fy how their property and business should be divided .
Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 , but a sharp dispute over the separation takes place in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers possess 38 real estate valued at more than half a billion dollars , accumulated since the 1973 family bought a business in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood .
the West@@ co Je@@ ans family founded and grew up to a chain of 160 retail outlets .
it was sold to 85 million US dollars in 1999 .
this money was invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lut@@ is now covers offices in Stad@@ tz@@ rum , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler and shopping m@@ alls .
after an agreement with her dec@@ eased father Colin - from Paul as &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the family De Lut@@ is described - about two @-@ thirds of the company &apos;s wealth and Paul is about one third .
a judicial file says that this means that Colin Property is valued at $ 316 million and Paul in a value of 176 million dollars .
the division of real estate and cash has proved a problem for Paul as a problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those of Colin proposed resolutions have left him with that which I kept for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in a first aff@@ id@@ av@@ it in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Friday , after several failed violations , the Supreme Court &apos;s First Trial Chamber took place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the brothers now also struggle for control over the existing store - in which Colin , as Paul claims to be excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Colin argu@@ ed that it is not true , but casts Paul ahead of managing some owners in@@ competent .
in an early aff@@ id@@ av@@ it that was filed by Colin , he says he hope to settle the argument .
&quot; my Italian heritage suggests that the family is the most important priority . &quot; he wrote .
the costs are in the case , with hundreds of pages with aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , emails and reports of companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with the leading lawyers , including Allan My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and from both sides of the law firms .
Mrs. De Lut@@ is and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants , the dairy bars and del@@ icacy stores in the late 1950 &apos;s and in the early se@@ ven@@ ties bought a business in Br@@ uns@@ wick .
they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood lawn , in Colin den &apos;s first je@@ ans@@ invite family .
Colin tells that he began to be West@@ co , when he was &quot; in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) .
Anna De Lut@@ is says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hopes to share their property to her sons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi often said to me that he would never want to land the brothers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no more part of the De Lut@@ is group , and Colin claims that Mark was paid at the rise of the company 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paul &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Colin has with@@ held a lot , although he was a former AF@@ L @-@ member and after a biography from the year 2015 by Eddie Mc@@ Gu@@ ire the best friend of the television stars .
Fair@@ fax Media took contact with Colin and Paul De Lut@@ is and their lawyers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only Colin replied by SMS to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really can &apos;t say much , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the case is before the courts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very sad that my brother Paul has decided to complain me and pull our sur@@ name by the courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 Colin in writing to the court that he tried to fulfill the demands of his brother .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and I would end in our current argument , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He was still on a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday , this hope seemed over .
&quot; our matter will be solved in the near future of the courts &quot; wrote Colin .
Tr@@ um@@ ps is planning to re@@ strict the President &apos;s media abst@@ in@@ ence .
others have tried and failed .
perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do it .
if so , he will be the first .
POL@@ IT@@ ICO reported that the new staff of staff of the White House plans to limit the information flow to President Tr@@ ump - including reports of the news media - in the hope to keep the boss on a more consistent course .
here is a piece of rep@@ orter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , came to his first working day with executive employees , he presented a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps White House that he will rep@@ airing : bad information that come into the hands of the President .
Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in letters - because President would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot;
wa@@ it@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have attempted to t@@ ate tr@@ ump by super@@ v@@ ise its media coverage .
President Tr@@ um@@ ps relationship to television dates back to decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his television advertising is still strong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the candidate was upset because of an un@@ fair coverage it was productive to show him that he had received a fair coverage of places , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the former electoral consultant Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February compared to Polit@@ ico ICO . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Polit@@ ic@@ os Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the key to hold Tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter hab@@ it under control , according to six former election campaign , is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a pri@@ ce@@ ful praise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
okay . OK .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the idea that Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos; s Twitter hab@@ it ever &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was ridi@@ culous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps this campaign leaders know something that we do not know others - that tr@@ um@@ ps twe@@ ets would have included more combust@@ ible without their inter@@ ventions .
we will probably never hear anything about the twe@@ ets that has not sent Tr@@ ump .
if his collabor@@ ators took him away , anger from him , their efforts have paid off .
but no one has consistently been able to prevent tr@@ ump contro@@ vers@@ y .
part of the problem is that people in a White House , which focuses on competing parties , will always try to present their own agenda by supporting a tr@@ ump material , which may support their views from the world .
POL@@ IT@@ ICO - very busy with this story - reported on the pre@@ ference of advis@@ ers to doub@@ tful information from strategic reasons in May .
this was an example described by Reporter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current and former Tr@@ ump officials say that Tr@@ ump can react to negative press releases , especially those with dam@@ aging le@@ aks , and that he will find out where they come from . &quot; &quot; &quot;
exactly that happened at the end of February , when someone has accused a printed copy of an article of Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet provo@@ ok@@ ate@@ urs Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief of the K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; the source behind a pile of le@@ aks &quot; to be in the White House .
although Johnson has been banned from Twitter or that he did not offer any concrete evidence or that he expressed false accus@@ ations in the past and ref@@ uses them .
Tr@@ ump read the article and started to ask staff about Wal@@ sh . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gold@@ macher added that the former staff of staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary @-@ General of the White House , Rob Por@@ ter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper@@ work and document the Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how did it work ?
Kelly is trying to do the same three months later .
perhaps he will prove more effective than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his impul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ers always stri@@ ve to influence .
these un@@ changing factors make wa@@ it@@ ys mission very difficult .
Mei@@ st@@ searched crimin@@ als receive post from Europ@@ ol
as the address is unknown , the aid of the population will pray and hop@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police in all Europe will be ma@@ iled in this summer ( virtual ) postcards to dangerous crimin@@ als on the run . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the addresses of searched heavy crimin@@ als are not known , they will be hoping for and pray from the population .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Europ@@ ol reported on Friday from the action that follows the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU Most Wan@@ ted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calendar of the winter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the experiences had shown that many whis@@ per of vacation dest@@ in@@ ations hide , it was called Europ@@ ol .
21 postcards from 21 EU countries have been compiled for 20 postcards from 21 EU countries .
since 2016 there has been the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ .de , more than 2.5 million times , it has been viewed .
36 of the online stores have been arrested so far , at least eleven of them due to their release on the website .
travelers negoti@@ ate over a dit@@ ch and return back to the &apos; million@@ aires &apos; row &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands are standing with some resol@@ ute trav@@ ellers , who have drawn one of the municipality drawn by the church in order to rec@@ laim a field prior to its manor house .
travelers have par@@ ked their 20 car@@ av@@ ans on a field outside a wealthy street of Soli@@ hull , which is called the &quot; million@@ aires series . &quot;
they have brought horses , babies and an army of transport , having gone out only in May , without being sc@@ ared of from the tren@@ ch gra@@ bs to prevent their sei@@ zu@@ res .
the tac@@ tical group found a gap in the defense posts and pushed their vehicles by one section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; fur@@ ious residents supp@@ ressed the Council of Soli@@ hull , who said it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; useless be to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; an anonymous inhabit@@ ant said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They are going there on Monday evening when they were sent by Bentley He@@ ath where they have thrown stones to the pass@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council must be forced by shame to implement , as it was useless when dealing with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the travelers were there in May , moved on and are now back .
more came on yesterday evening , probably even more . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of Birmingham also knows how to deal with it , holding long transfers to protect their parks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am living along the Stre@@ et@@ s@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to pay my community tax , if the Council cannot stop it again . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a local residents who didn &apos;t want to be named , said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It is ridi@@ culous , we just had to be lo@@ oted just the last round of these trav@@ ellers , just to be lo@@ oted by another round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the figures have increased this time and you even saw a horse in the park area . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ woman of Soli@@ hull said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorized camp on the country beyond the Stre@@ et@@ s@@ brook Road and work with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we sei@@ ze the necessary legal steps so quickly as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to support our evidence , it is very important that as many local residents are an anti @-@ social or criminal behavior in the police by calling 101 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our fall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Birken@@ hof is Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former Hotel Birken@@ hof , the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is located .
the house before the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ts is currently being renovated and will be re@@ opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closure of the Hotel Birken@@ hof through the former ambience of business society mbH on 13 April 2014 , some 30 000 nights were lost per year and proceeds from the tourist tax .
in the autumn of 2014 , in view of the numbers of refugees who came to the county , the hotel building was offered as collective accommodation , which provided for controversial discussions .
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seek@@ ers through setting up a development plan to secure the area as hotel location .
the decision was not disp@@ uted in the council at that time .
but especially Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ter Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel &apos;s location and said then back to the house for serious prospects .
he should keep right .
the Lu@@ isen@@ yi Group &apos;s head office with headquarters in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern has acquired the former Hotel Birken@@ hof with a voluntary increase in Berlin and wants to make it back to a house of the three @-@ star @-@ plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ municipal facility .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
you are hot Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
we have been standing at the previous Hotel Birken@@ hof for a longer time construction container before the entrance , and when you enter the house , it is clear what extensive renov@@ ations will be made .
the floors were torn out , ceilings for a part dismant@@ led , old bath@@ robe from the rooms .
the whole hotel building is a single building site .
until March there is still much to do .
&quot; it is actually a nice hotel , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper .
everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest .
the rooms are equipped with large @-@ walk showers , the input area is re@@ designed , new windows are installed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everything should later be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; beautifully bourgeois &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer is supp@@ ressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery . &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room belong to the equipment .
you don &apos;t want to position yourself at the high level of hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on a higher level of downtown .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approx . 60 rooms will be broad@@ ly elabor@@ ated , Sch@@ erer continues to clari@@ fy .
both individual tourists , groups or business people should feel comfortable in the hotel .
talks with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and Tourism director Michael K@@ rau@@ se did he already run as sh@@ erer .
the shows of the city are equal with those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
Thomas Sch@@ erer is not willing to establish itself after the amount of investment .
under a million euros , he reck@@ ons .
the exterior walls will also be brought to fore@@ man , which is clearly visible .
in a courtyard there is a large terrace , which is public accessible from the restaurant .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimistic : &quot; Freud &apos;s city is a good market . &quot;
Russia Aff@@ air : U.S. special investig@@ ator sets Grand Jury
in Russia &apos;s aff@@ aires by US President Donald Tr@@ ump , special investig@@ ators Robert Mu@@ eller should have used a so @-@ called Grand Jury .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the committee took the work in the past weeks , wrote the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on appeal to confi@@ dential persons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the newspaper evaluated the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller has expanded its investigations and intensi@@ fied .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; CNN Report &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; I already admit already the first pre@@ ach@@ ings of the committee in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s oldest son and a Russian lawyer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
us secret services acc@@ use the Kre@@ m@@ lin to have mixed himself into the presidential election campaign in 2016 .
Mu@@ eller exam@@ ines whether there were deportation between election campaign team and Moscow .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the focus of investigation , several men should stand at the election campaign as consultants of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to these reports , Mu@@ eller accepted a private and more tr@@ um@@ ps private and business environment under the micro@@ scope .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the special medi@@ ator Tr@@ ump I have moved to the center and seek the incident if the president could hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main task of Grand Law@@ ys is to test and decide the evidence in possible breaks and to decide whether the charges shall be charged . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Grand Jur@@ ys are therefore also called on counts .
mostly they are switched on if it is bigger and controversial cases .
the procedure is carried out behind closed doors .
the Panel can also be switched on by the Public Prosecutor to re@@ charge persons under E@@ id .
according to CNN &apos;s CNN , pre @-@ inv@@ it@@ ations were issued to turn around the meeting between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
persons who were involved in meetings were asked to be a statement called it was in the report .
they should also provide documents .
in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. , Tr@@ um@@ ps , and father @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner also served Paul Man@@ a@@ fort .
right wing experts said on Thursday evening in US television that Mu@@ eller could not in@@ ti@@ mi@@ date that Mu@@ eller could not in@@ ti@@ mi@@ date himself in his work and that it should be necessary to act quickly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it must not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be on at the end to decide about the survey of a charge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the introduction of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for President Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the midst of the new revel@@ ations , the President on Thursday evening had given a speech in West Virginia to show the Russia affair as campaign of its political opponents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Russia history is a total invention , &quot; said Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the theme gives the demo@@ cr@@ ats a way to feel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; feel good &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because they have nothing else about which they can speak . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his special advisor to T@@ y Cob@@ b stated in a statement he know@@ eth nothing of the composition of a Grand Jury .
however , they usually work in secret men , he emphas@@ ised .
the White House advoc@@ ates any action that accelerated the work of the special medi@@ ation on &quot; f@@ aire . &quot;
the former FBI chief James Com@@ ey said three times that won &apos;t be determined by the President .
you have no reason to assume that something has changed , it was on the explanation .
but Mu@@ eller had only been used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of this r@@ allies were accus@@ ations against dr@@ ump , he did not want to hin@@ der the justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Com@@ ey said in June before a Senate Committee , Tr@@ ump asked him for a setting of investigations against the former National Security Advisor to Michael Fl@@ ynn .
the president is under enormous pressure due to the investigation .
according to the US media , the White House gathered material against the special medi@@ ator and his staff .
this triggered spec@@ ulation about whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller wants to be released .
unlike an independent special investig@@ ator of the congress , such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair , Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller , has given a position in which he could be fired theore@@ tically on dents of the President of Justice of Justice .
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
two groups of rep@@ ubli@@ can and democratic sen@@ ators put off the bill of law on Thursday , after which the special medi@@ ator could not be dismissed anymore .
Antarc@@ tica : gigantic ice mountain drives in Antarc@@ tica
in the western arc@@ tic , a gigantic ice@@ berg was solved by the barely seven @-@ fold size of Berlin from Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is .
this was shared by the Bremer@@ haven &apos;s Alfred @-@ We@@ gener @-@ Institute for Polar@@ - and Marine Research on Wednesday .
the roughly one tr@@ illion tons heavy and 5@@ 800 square @-@ kilometer large piston drive will drive back to the north and will probably need two , three years until it melted .
it operates at 175 kilometers of length and a width of up to 50 kilometers of one of the largest polar workers , researchers have registered in the past three decades .
there is no danger for people from him .
to what extent the climate change has played a role in the r@@ ump of the ice@@ berg , is un@@ clear according to research data .
however , since around 30 years , there have been a series of unusual coll@@ ages of ice cream in the region , the US Research Center for snow and ice ( NS@@ IDC ) writes in a fac@@ eted background .
according to many researchers , this can be related to global warming .
the broken Kol@@ oss was a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is so far .
Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is flo@@ ats on the sea and is fed by great gl@@ ac@@ iers .
it continues to grow in the sea and breaks regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is located south of South America almost at the fore@@ front of the ant@@ arc@@ tic peninsula .
North of this clas@@ sy was the balance of wa@@ xing and dis@@ rup@@ ting a few years ago .
a complete Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is disin@@ te@@ gr@@ ated there , writes AW@@ I @-@ researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen .
there is some evidence that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is in danger , because the front edge had never with@@ drawn himself as far as currently .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the ice plate stand under voltage and can disin@@ te@@ gr@@ ate if a piece is shot at a key point . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the melting of Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is and Eis@@ berg does not increase sea level , as they swim on the water and pushed ice as much water as it yields .
however , the loss of the shadow leads to the gl@@ ac@@ iers directly into the sea and can drain much faster than before .
this could possibly increase the sea level , but only in a low degree , the British research project becomes an observation of Antarc@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is the fourth largest Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is of the Antarc@@ tic according to AW@@ I data with almost 50 000 square kilometres .
on the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick , at the edge to the free ocean around 200 meters .
there it breaks regularly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although it is a natural development and not a direct connection to climate change , the ice sign is now in a dangerous position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ Le@@ ary from the British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is the longest retreat since the beginning of records , &quot; he also confirmed .
among scientists was argu@@ ed whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is will grow back or long @-@ term , his colleague Adrian Luck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will last decades .
even if this researcher did not lead the abor@@ tion of this gigantic ice@@ berg on climate change , so many ice caps have been torn apart from the Antarc@@ tic Peninsula in recent decades .
this long stretch of Antarc@@ tic stretches towards South America .
according to data from the British Antarc@@ tic Survey , the ice surface of the Antarc@@ tic Peninsula has declined 28 000 square kilometers since the 1950s .
the temperature increase had contributed to the decline .
the Antarc@@ tic Peninsula has war@@ med around three degrees in the past 50 years , making it among the areas where the temperature is fastest .
CDU wants pets in the staff
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because it is more difficult to occupy free vac@@ ant positions , the CDU ur@@ ges the association to become more attractive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only shortly before the summer break the Kre@@ ist@@ ag got 41 new jobs in the administration .
more than 1100 employees and officials are working for the administration administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 trainees have their first working day behind them .
the teachers in the circle are obviously very cov@@ eted .
some 620 applications were added to the awar@@ ding spots for this year .
however , the circuit is still lacking staff to cope with increased demands and tasks .
currently , there are still 50 occupied places around the circle M@@ ett@@ mann .
among other things , doctors and engineers and forces of the general administration are sought .
the CDU would like to sei@@ ze the initiative together with F@@ DP and the U@@ WG and def@@ ending the company in management .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the desire of the parties , the management is to work on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a concept for personal recovery and personal development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the goal is to un@@ cover not only short @-@ term commit@@ tees on professionals , but future @-@ oriented applications . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the overall concept should be oriented towards the inside and outside , show concrete measures for trans@@ ference and a training offensive , CDU , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
this already sounds like a good approach .
for the circle has to do it with staff problems , which you did not know earlier .
other cities advert@@ ise good civil servants and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is of a real &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; public employer &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to this end , a high number of employees who dis@@ connect disease or age due to service .
so high time for action , so that no more places remain un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter Peop@@ les , chief of the CDU , goes beyond the mutual request with his party .
he cat@@ ered for a while in the Kre@@ ist@@ ag for a fine @-@ thick surprise when he publicly found the personnel ro@@ cking publicly in question and the remaining parties flour@@ ished .
people want all the possibilities to be checked out , which enable an exit from municipal employers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we are not in short term for a satisfactory solution , the administration management of the unions - perhaps also in collaboration with the county @-@ affiliated cities - should stri@@ ve for a domestic tari@@ ff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so peoples &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
by doing so , the CDU , employees and officials are trying to pay better than the prices for public service .
the sal@@ aries are currently prescribed , increases or more money only if you are moving into a higher level , which is based on professional years .
but the task of the county has grown steadily over the past years .
only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new pro@@ stit@@ utes Act .
not least by the increasing number of asylum seek@@ ers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ director Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy dra@@ fts the tone to NGO migrants &apos; rescue bo@@ oting
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has warned the rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they may not continue to continue their new rules for their operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if NGOs do not write a new code of code , it is difficult to see how they can work , &quot; said Interior Minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ ampa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Minn@@ itis warning came a day after the Italian authorities had seized a boat by the German aid organization &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Youth Ret@@ tet &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because their crew had worked effectively with human traff@@ ickers in a way that shook illegal immigration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the relief organisation , which has only been in operation since a year , declined to out@@ board the Italian government char@@ ms Amb@@ ro@@ gio Cart@@ o@@ o .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us and remains our top priority for the salvation of human life . so we are sorry that we can &apos;t operate in the search and rescue zone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organization in a statement about social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can judge all the accus@@ ations currently raised , just judge after we have collected all the information and judge the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had super@@ vised the boat from &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a since October .
it is thought that its crew supplies hose @-@ boats aboard , which can be delivered directly from traff@@ ickers , and that the s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can depart , so the ships can be used again .
only 1.3 miles before the Libyan coast took place at least one such meeting , according to the Prosecutor &apos;s Act , its content was published by Italian media .
the crew is suspected of taking over the authority of the Italian coast@@ guards , which monitors life imprisonment in the zone of humanitarian reasons and not from any other mot@@ if@@ s .
under the code of conduct , boats like I@@ u@@ vent@@ a must have an Italian police officers who have watched their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue companies have been ready to keep the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter once said on Thursday that the new rules would be unnecessary , but unacceptable that they would not bring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; essential changes or disability &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of their rescue actions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among those who refuse to sign up is the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate organization Doc@@ tors Without Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Minn@@ iti said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the number of migrants who arrived in Italy has declined sharp@@ ly in the last weeks that the efforts to strengthen the Libyan Coast Guard and the cooperation with local citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last days we began to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens in this month about economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in hope to reach Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
asc@@ ents and Tri@@ als
nine ham@@ let bikers , the &quot; Berliner Foreign Policy &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ en@@ heim in the Nord@@ pf@@ alz , to enjoy four days long and sight@@ seeing .
there were three friendly guides available for this .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer valley proved to be a good starting point for tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and W@@ einf@@ est from Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour took hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ epi@@ elle above D@@ ei@@ des@@ heim .
view@@ points followed , partly on towers , from which one could look far beyond the Palat@@ inate Forest and the Pre@@ vent@@ ured levels .
in between there were again long climb@@ s for the long tri@@ ck@@ ling .
on the second day , there went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and the Volks@@ fest Wur@@ st@@ markt .
another view point to the view@@ point , connected by &quot; flew &quot; Tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents .
on the last two days there were again many meters of altitude .

after 173 kilometers and almost 4500 meters , the group had the Pf@@ äl@@ zer forest from its best side - sporty and cultural .
console instead of grass - Bundesliga fit for e @-@ sport
are the sports stars in future before computer consoles , instead of strug@@ gling through the wind and weather over the stadium to fight ?
fact : e @-@ sport is long ago to become a serious business , become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - great stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high charges included .
these have also recognized the first federal state , which are increasingly involved in this area .
the beginning of 2015 was the V@@ f@@ L Wolfsburg , followed by FC Schal@@ ke 04 and finally the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @-@ sport department in mid @-@ July and took two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 under contract .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to inspire the whole new target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says CEO Jochen Rö@@ tt@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is certain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there are some clubs on this turn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the upcoming weekend , FIFA World @-@ Association organized FIFA in London to play the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup , &quot; in which the Gam@@ er will compete different clubs .
in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfsburg , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or the PS@@ V Eindhoven have qualified .
also Robin D@@ utt sees great potential in e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ Trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen has meanwhile advis@@ es an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real football has to deal with the 14 to 30 year old , that young people will go to the stadium in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 52 year old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and : the temp@@ ting , all kinds of markets , especially the Asian to conquer .
with prominent E @-@ athletes under contract , you could be able to present far more often on these markets than once in the year , to submit to Asia .
what does it work exactly ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the E @-@ Sport computer games like &quot; League Of Legends &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Dot@@ A 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or just the football @-@ simulation FIFA at the competition level . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the normal sport , as in the normal sport they have established themselves , in which the professionals compete against each other .
and in Asia Pacific E @-@ Sport is already part of the official program .
but is it a proper sport ?
for many , the not@@ ion is typically used .
Ingo F@@ rob@@ otic has also dealt with the question for a long time .
for the professor at the German Spor@@ th@@ ochschule in Cologne , e @-@ sport is a sport since it is competent and many biological and physical reactions which you can also find in classic sport - for example , increased heart rate effects , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes .
it also need cognitive abilities , technical and tac@@ tical understanding and fast reaction .
professional Gam@@ er should not only exercise on the console but also exercise their bodies and take care of the nutrition .
&quot; the fit@@ ter player is a good player . &quot;
however , F@@ rob@@ otic sees problems : &quot; d@@ oping is becoming increasingly a topic . &quot;
checks are hard fe@@ as@@ ible for online games , and in the scene the structures of the classical sports are missing .
scientists emphas@@ ises the high integr@@ ative effect of the E @-@ Sports .
the players are international on the way , that &apos;s like a big global family , there are no inter@@ cultural shirts .
a study by the management consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association of Inter@@ active entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts the e @-@ sport a rapid growth .
in 2016 , 50 million euros has been implemented in Germany , mainly on advertising , sponsor@@ ship and big tournaments .
sales are expected to be 130 million in three years .
against the nearly 2.4 billion euros of the soccer league that &apos;s little .
however , the E @-@ Sport &quot; is no longer far from other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball , ice hockey , &quot; Del@@ o@@ itte consultant .
International countries are already far@@ ther .
major markets are Asia and the USA where ex @-@ basketball player Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ guez will participate in the US Team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton K@@ ut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sport competition Uni@@ kr@@ n .
some in Europe also does a lot .
in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sport were introduced as a classroom , says F@@ rob@@ otic .
in the Netherlands and in France , the football @-@ first @-@ liga @-@ clubs are obliged to set up an e @-@ sports department .
&quot; in the European comparison , Germany is lag@@ ging behind , &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B executive board of Rö@@ tt@@ ger@@ mann .
only decay in nost@@ algia , and the old times to clari@@ fy , is today no longer sufficient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about maintaining the tradition of the association , but the company is simultaneously al@@ ign on the modern market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we live in a digital world , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says D@@ utt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t hold on it , that only the football is the same as it was always . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Michelle Carter due to his texts , which Conrad Roy condem@@ ns suicide , sentenced to suicide
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend by writing lyrics and calls to suicide .
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her condem@@ nation behind bars and five years have been suspended .
Carter was sentenced to death in June for the death of Conrad Roy who took life on 13 July 2014 .
the father of Roy said on Thursday at the Hear@@ ing : &quot; my family is wrong .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to stay free until his appeal .
she had been confron@@ ted with a maximum of 20 years , but their legal representatives had argu@@ ed that both them and Mr Roy suffered from a mental illness .
dressed in red tro@@ users and a cre@@ amy bl@@ ouse , Carter stood with tears in the eyes , with folded hands , and down@@ ward eyes , when she was convicted .
&quot; their actions have killed Conrad Roy , &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the court .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she finished his life to make her own better . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she has no responsibility , &quot; she said .
&quot; it has shown no regret . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ters said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible change &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He did not find out that you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; age or Rei@@ f@@ eg@@ rad or even her mental disease have a significant impact on their actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a prosec@@ utor read a statement by Ro@@ ys mother Lyn@@ n Roy who said it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is no day in whom I will not mo@@ urn the loss of my beloved son . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want him to be proud of me and how I &apos;m going to work with everything . I try to bear with all my pain , which we will bear for eternity , for his sisters to be there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ ys &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said she would never be persecuted by the knowledge &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she will never take part in her brother &apos;s wedding or a aun@@ t for his children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no longer have this only person with whom I have been together since my birth , is a pain that I am ever kept for the rest of my life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case seems to place a legal preced@@ ent , as there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime to claim another attempt to commit suicide .
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning in a vehicle in 2014 .
the case drew national attention to himself , after Car@@ ters revealed text messages , that she had encouraged him to stop his life .
&quot; Hän@@ g you , spring from a building , get yourself , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; she said in several news , which she had sent in several weeks before his death , while he was on holiday with his family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the eyes of his suicide , she wrote , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You must do it , Conrad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; All that you must do is to enter the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter sought attention through the death of Roy and ordered that they should benefit from the case by any press .
the case has divided the legal opinion .
among the few who defended Carter , Amanda Knox , who was convicted of murder in Italy in 2007 , was acquitted before two years ago .
Ms. Knox , 30 years old , published in the Los Angeles Times comments : &quot; Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua K@@ imm@@ ich : learn from the new Mini @-@ L@@ ah@@ m of FC Bayern
that Joshua K@@ imm@@ ich was allowed to run when captain in the Audi Cup , is no co@@ incidence .
FC Bayern is entru@@ sted to the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner a major season - extra motivation does not harm .
anything was different from his place in the cabin , that was Joshua K@@ imm@@ ich immediately , even if the additional garment was very , very small .
but as far and wide at the second day of the Audi C@@ ups , of course , no Philipp L@@ ah@@ m and no Manuel Neuer has been seen , he made himself the split of bind on the arm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the coach has not announced it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner was after his first use as Bayern captain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
good things could have been better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but the character of the coach could also interpret .
not the eight year older Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al was chosen in the youth playing , de@@ but@@ ant and just chosen for the existing C @-@ El@@ f professionals , but he was chosen .
to give su@@ gar@@ l to those who want to get a lot of sav@@ ory , who wants to keep in the mood .
those who are chosen by L@@ ah@@ m , can only use a little extra motivation for good use .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ imm@@ ich confirmed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what you want as a player to take over responsibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old serves as mini @-@ L@@ ah@@ m over the field .
at the right back , this is now his position , the white Bin@@ de on the arm did her rest .
and at all I had worked in this start@@ up , like the one who can take the Ru@@ der also best in the hand .
he gave instructions , tried to di@@ vert the un@@ loaded tro@@ upe .
he had the look for the whole , while many others were busy himself .
Vid@@ al thus unable to over@@ play his lack of fitness ( fol@@ ly barely ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches , on the devil come out to the performances of Asia Pacific ( fol@@ ks even only ) ; and Sebastian Rud@@ y and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le thus refused to fall into their first appearance in Bayern @-@ Tri@@ k@@ ot .
after all , it worked pretty well .
in addition to K@@ imm@@ ich , Rud@@ y walked in front of the defense , both intri@@ gu@@ ed so@@ vereign .
the rep@@ udi@@ ated Nap@@ oli @-@ storm was often difficult , and she also tried a few times in the playsite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his colleague Rud@@ y was said that the result was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not like we were hoping for that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he also showed extraordinary performance at their debut .
&quot; &quot; &quot; game shift , Tem@@ po@@ change : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was also fet@@ ched for this style . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as usual , this Bayern Welt is still for the re @-@ moving , you saw the game following .
Rud@@ y was in the Cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs not one or two , but definitely six or seven interviews .
K@@ imm@@ ich said after a few cr@@ un@@ chy statements in his back of his new players .
there he heard from Sü@@ le an interesting sentence : &quot; what is going on here , I already noticed .
with Bavaria you just have to win any game . &quot;
at least he doesn &apos;t have to teach the new .

company satisfied with rh@@ age @-@ country ministers : Economy pra@@ ises W@@ iss@@ ings Tempo
it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ ably , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as Ev@@ eline Lem@@ ke ( Green ) nor the Minister of State of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate was .
this is reflected in office after more than one year , in which the new Minister of Economy Volker W@@ iss@@ ing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak on T V @-@ request from a change in economic policy - and simultaneously the old minist@@ erin .
Frank Nat@@ us , chairman of the association Tri@@ erer ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; W@@ iss@@ ing attacks the desires of the economy to block the Lem@@ ke . &quot;
the biggest draw@@ back sees Nat@@ us in infrastructure policies : the placement of the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au stands at the priority list of the country now very above .
still this year the ministry is hoping for a planning process , until 2021 it is supposed to be the building law .
a role in the plans of the country also plays the West @-@ crossing of Trier , which is in the urgent need of the federal government .
the aim is to take the track in operation in December 2020 , &quot; says Minist@@ erial Review in Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
Nat@@ us sees a sign@@ post to support regional , but internationally competitive companies .
the wine industry and Commerce ( I@@ HK ) Trier will stri@@ ve to increase the sales of a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate label , in order to increase the sales of sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German wine exports for ten years .
in addition , W@@ iss@@ ing had an open ear for people who want to start a company , pra@@ ises the I@@ HK .
the Trier Handwerk@@ skammer Trier looks an additional inc@@ en@@ tive for young apprenti@@ ces , says CEO Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach .
a premium of 1000 Euro is provided for the In@@ gre@@ ens Master@@ test and 2500 euros when graduates are self @-@ evident within ten years after the master@@ piece .
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
for the planned road construction are quick facts to create , at the same time Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , Managing Director of the I@@ HK Trier is out of the country .
at present , only 29 jobs have been occupied by 56 new engineers who want to set up business operations .
the I@@ HK calls for more orders to be awarded to external offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; CDU @-@ spokesperson Christian Bald@@ auf refers to the calculations of the Court , the country invested in 2017 and 2018 more than 20 million euros less in receiving regional roads as proposed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Frank Nat@@ us also expects another concept of the country , as it wants to solve the specialist in the region .
so@@ ber@@ ing may also be the previous broad@@ band building in the country .
in 2016 , regional companies had only rated the power supply in an I@@ HK survey with a note of 3.4 .
they compl@@ ained about pitch Internet connections and out@@ breaks .
former Minister Ev@@ eline Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics at the moment and is still at the Supervisory Board of the wind @-@ company Pro Wind .
the Green Group left Lem@@ ke for April to become President of a private university in Karlsruhe - where they were back in four months due to dis@@ agreements already .
Audi should change 8@@ 0,000 diesel vehicles - autom@@ akers see themselves with a counter action .
one day before the announcement of Audi said BMW , that it would offer to update the software in more than 35@@ 0,000 vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the company said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company is the opinion that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s intelligent options available as a road@@ side , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and referring to European cities - including Munich where BMW is based - diesel vehicles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Daimler announced that there are three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to modify its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the under@@ tak@@ ings as a recall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; European autom@@ akers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , nitrogen oxi@@ des that em@@ it diesel engines are considered car@@ cin@@ ogenic and can cause asthma .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of autom@@ akers , equipment for neutr@@ alisation of the exhaust gases to install , take also what makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of ignore the powerful car companies and to ignore the signs of the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company attempt to avoid mistakes from Volkswagen to regul@@ ate the use of so @-@ called Ab@@ sch@@ alt devices to regul@@ ate emissions when a car was tested , but in normal driving conditions .
in the United States several employees were indicted by Volkswagen , others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former leader of the ther@@ mod@@ y@@ nam@@ ics was arrested in Audi in Germany .
the former manager , Zac@@ che@@ o Giovanni Pam@@ io , is Italian and is therefore not protected from extra@@ dition and could be charged in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi has been involved in German criminal investigations into Volkswagen , after the authorities have installed Audi to circum@@ vent a system to deal with emissions standards in Europe , and a request that focused on the United States .
the inclusion of Audi in the study could be difficult to say : the luxury car manufacturer carries out propor@@ tion@@ ately to the gain of Volkswagen .
this Message has the raft on Saturday at the Is@@ ar
the city wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
in order to join the Is@@ ar visitors on Saturday morning , a raft goes through Munich which has a special message .
if it attracts again to the Is@@ ar on Saturday , there will be a big raft there between F@@ lau@@ cher and Rei@@ chen@@ bach@@ brücke .
and this is not a common raft , with Is@@ ar @-@ tourists .
but the building reference wants to clari@@ fy .
on the float one sees a big inf@@ ot@@ ran@@ ny .
it shows a garbage dump .
the pre@@ lu@@ de to a public@@ ity campaign to call for the Is@@ ar visitors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; True Love &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; should the understanding of the Is@@ ar as a protective wilderness . &quot; &quot; &quot;
already last summer the raft are passed over the Is@@ ar and this year there are further actions and measures to achieve a reck@@ less and environmentally conscious behaviour .
Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll@@ ares and the laughter of the suffering
Mor@@ di@@ llo was tempor@@ ally one of the most popular Cart@@ oon illustr@@ ator , the Kn@@ oll@@ enn@@ ines of his figures are its trademark .
also with 85 the Argent@@ in@@ ier still records and works on a film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his message : laughter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; For there is too much suffering in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 by the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist , he experienced himself as a dra@@ fts@@ man for congrat@@ ulation - what fru@@ str@@ ated him .
&quot; the happ@@ iest day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he said once .
after stops in Lima , New York and Paris , at the end of the &apos; 60s the breakthrough : with the publication of his cart@@ oons in Paris Match , and then also in the &quot; star &quot; and other leading magazines around the world .
even in China Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
again , the artist moved from cities .
big , ro@@ un@@ dish mor@@ di@@ llo figures , in drawings of the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and Red Square in Moscow .
according to the early morning , he still sits on the animation today , almost ten hours a day .
over calendar , puzzles , books for Gross and Klein , T @-@ Shirts , Pl@@ ush animals and watches continue to find its dro@@ pping figures worldwide .
he has been working on a cartoon animation and a TV series with its figures for six years .
the main person in the film &quot; Crazy Island &quot; is a gi@@ raffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los any favourite animal in his drawings - which has a thou@@ sand@@ al player as a counter@@ actor .
for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D movie that will come to the cinema screen in 2019 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they say , it &apos;s strange to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the script is not written by him .
therefore he puts on the TV series , which is produced in original drawings , as its original drawings .
lav@@ ender from Provence is threatened by climate change
he has become a symbol of Provence in southern France , but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lav@@ ender is re@@ mind@@ ing of d@@ rought conditions and because of diseases over@@ bearing insects , which scientists and farmers who try to find solutions to find large head@@ aches . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eric Cha@@ ises , expert of the farm Research Institute CR@@ I@@ EP@@ P@@ AM in Provence , said : &quot; the Lav@@ ender in Provence is effective because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change , which took much less rain in the spring and in the autumn much more .
this has effects on the lif@@ espan of lav@@ ender .
there is also a small zoo , a micro@@ bacterial , the Zwerg@@ zi@@ k@@ ades , and in very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and it is much on the game .
lav@@ ender oil is not only for vac@@ ation@@ ists , it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of very long plant watches with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weak@@ ened .
so we have less parts with essential oil . &quot;
the solutions that are considered to be considered a better water distribution and the slow@@ down of ev@@ ap@@ oration from the ground , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties , which are more resistant to dry conditions .
the village of Ge@@ isa in the Thur@@ ing@@ ian vines this year celebrates its 1200 @-@ year anniversary .

the assassination of a journalist under@@ scores the growing threat in Mexico
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employees of the Weekly Ri@@ o@@ ce can normally meet mit@@ och@@ s to check their plans for reporting over the most recent chaos in the state of S@@ inal@@ oa through organised crime , corrupt civil servants and un@@ ceas@@ ing drug wars . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but on that day , in the shade of her own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
it was told them that it is important to change their rout@@ ines .
two high @-@ level journalists will discuss what feels more secure : they are supposed to take their children to the office which were the aim of a attack with gren@@ ades , or at home in 2009 .
safety experts have written three words on a table on the front of the room : opponent , Ne@@ utr@@ ale , allies .
they kindly ask the rep@@ orter to propos@@ e names for each column - no proof is necessary , perc@@ ep@@ tions and belly gu@@ ilt .
there are drug s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected of standing on the hearing list of government or cart@@ els , a catalogue of crimin@@ als that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there is no rest of violence , and throughout the country the cor@@ p@@ ses were frequent , and more journalists came to office at least 25 , ever since President En@@ rique P@@ ena Nie@@ to in December 2012 has stood his office . 5@@ 89 have been standing by attacks and threats under federal protection and until now there was at least seven deaths in seven countries this year .
among the latter is her editors and her inspiration from Ri@@ odo@@ ce , the co @-@ founder Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez again wrote in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his absence is felt deeply , although his presence is present everywhere - a big picture of Val@@ dez , that shows his mid @-@ finger with the word &quot; Justice &quot; - two rep@@ orters in the thir@@ ties , carrying T @-@ Shirts , which show its smiling face with glasses or its typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop will take place less than two months after his death , and rep@@ orters discuss their shared topics , trau@@ ma , their night@@ mar@@ es , in@@ som@@ nia , par@@ ano@@ ia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although a special lawyer was built in 2010 in order to process the cases of journalists , the committee led to the Committee to protect journalists only two criminal proceedings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as with most thousands of mur@@ ders that are linked with drug traff@@ icking and organized crime every year , journalists of journalists are only rarely asked .
at Ri@@ odo@@ ce they still exist to treat the violence of S@@ inal@@ oa , although they are in@@ consol@@ able , although the terrain is still more tra@@ itors .
without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting of safety has little benefits , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we don &apos;t know the why , we stum@@ ble everyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he managed to drive a few blocks away , before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was arrested by two men . he was shot from his car and was shot in him for 12 times , presumably because of the name of the paper - which is translated with &quot; twelve river . &quot;
the cap passed away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to walk around in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but the topic of Val@@ dez is practically nothing but silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest in January and the extra@@ dition of the United States in January , S@@ inal@@ oa became one of the most bloody batt@@ le@@ fields of the country , since riv@@ alling fra@@ ctions are strug@@ gling here to fill the vacuum .
it doesn &apos;t matter that in S@@ inal@@ oa , someone or more people are shot on the road , or that the cemetery is full of intri@@ c@@ ted , two @-@ story maus@@ ole@@ ums for drug may be larger than many houses for the living .
&quot; &quot; &quot; remember for a minute that there is a state of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; peace &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if only a car@@ tel has control over the coastal state with its precious har@@ bours and drugs trading routes in the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work is Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , with the blame for it that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ understand@@ ings have contributed to the murder .
first of all , in February , the publication of a interview with Dam@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival fac@@ tions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ mans sons .
this publication may have anno@@ yed the sons , bound gang@@ sters bought a copy of each copy as soon as it was delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the second mistake was to force Val@@ dez , after the conf@@ is@@ cation of a different newspaper , which had published the same story to leave the country for his own safety . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is considered a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues could im@@ itate that he would always be there .
he worked as experienced rep@@ orter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 , when he joined forces with five colleagues at the establishment of Ri@@ o@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars in shar@@ ehol@@ dings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in S@@ inal@@ oa , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism without having trouble the tox@@ ic@@ ant problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the time the newspaper had a reputation for dis@@ cour@@ ageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising revenue .
rep@@ orter loved to publish hard @-@ like investigations without fear of c@@ ens@@ orship , and readers were fascinated by a publication where they could read stories that nobody had to handle anything else .
eight years after the founding of Ri@@ o@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot award &quot; for their coverage in Latin America .
in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee to protect journalists for his courage in pursu@@ ing Mexican drug history , wherever it lead .
he gave up voluntarily that he was afraid .
&quot; I want to continue to live , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award .
&quot; &quot; &quot; drug traff@@ icking in S@@ inal@@ oa , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a way of life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV last October . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you need to take the task that falls you as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ my .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What have you done about so many sco@@ oters ... why did you not say what was going on ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ o@@ ce team missed Val@@ dez , the fun @-@ bird , who was able to curse the friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
you trusted in his routine .
he would always carry his hat .
he always would go to El Guay@@ abo , the bar opposite the office , and always sit there at the same table .
now ask them : was his love for routine practice ?
she also forced his death to ask her own ass@@ ump@@ tions about how she was able to complete their work and stay in life .
&quot; they don &apos;t like it if you are dealing with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their secret start and landing ways . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez said .
the result is , even in the best times , a high level of sel@@ enium and self @-@ holding .
his own inst@@ inc@@ ts trust .
if it smells wrong , it will stay away .
the trouble is , the editor of the Ri@@ o@@ ce And@@ res Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; smell a sense that can be fool@@ ed ... and then it happened with Javier . &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , apply in S@@ inal@@ oa , no more - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states in which a toxic mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative mu@@ g@@ gling routes , weak institutions and corrupt government officials are home .
the landscape is changing constantly .
in the room where the staff of Ri@@ o@@ ce met for security training , there were suddenly no mobile phones allowed . days earlier , Spy@@ ware , who is sold exclusively to governments , was used for monitoring journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside of the heat , two police officers sought protection against heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree .
they were commissioned by the State Government to protect the offices of Ri@@ o@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
half in the j@@ okes , some of the rep@@ orter asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen , who identified the governor himself as tru@@ st@@ worthy .
it is months ago , since the rep@@ orter went to the mountain scenery , where drug gangs are de facto under control .
for the release of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ ce has blocked three main stories .
it was the assassination of the former renowned box@@ ers Julio C@@ esar Cha@@ vez in S@@ inal@@ oa .
they also had an Ex@@ pos@@ é to the state spending , focused on the home town of the governor .
there was a group located in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a souvenir from the Office of the Office , a kidn@@ apping .
there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or how it happened , so caution was enjo@@ ined to write what everyone in the city know : that the restaurant is a favourite local of drug traff@@ ickers and authorities .
a rep@@ orter learned from public notes that the restaurant was registered under the name of a polit@@ ician who ruled the ruling inst@@ al@@ ant &apos;s Party ( pr@@ i ) that ruled almost all the century all political levels .
recently , several pr@@ i @-@ govern@@ ors were accused of corruption of high @-@ class corruption .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the rep@@ orter to write about previous events in this restaurant , including one in which a son of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military attack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a few months earlier , readers could have viewed the column of Val@@ dez as the best informed source about ab@@ duction .
&quot; earlier we had known what happened , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nickname &quot; El FLACO &quot; because of its slim body .
&quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
the office of Val@@ dez was dedicated to the storage room for signs and st@@ ickers that protest@@ ing against the Mor@@ de of journalists , because the employees have become something they had never expected : activists in the name of the press .
rep@@ or@@ ant Miri@@ am R@@ ami@@ rez gra@@ b@@ bed a few signs and went to a demonstration in the next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist to the Office of the Office .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed , in the western federal state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body was discovered and officials say based on DNA testing that it is his .
journalists have become lou@@ dly stronger in the country by making them down in organized protests &quot; SOS Press . &quot;
on that day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is gone in Washington and tried to collect international support for the justice in the Val@@ dez case .
in a meeting with the governor of S@@ inal@@ oa on the day following the assassination of Val@@ dez , R@@ ami@@ rez accused the authorities to express journalists and kill them because they said the truth .
it has since then asked that she is again divided by the government because she is worried that their rage has hurt her objec@@ tivity .
Val@@ dez again said that journalists in Mexico had been surrounded by organized crime against the government officials and an equal society . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in his last book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nar@@ co Journ@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he wrote that rep@@ orters not only be killed by drug gangs , but also on the command of politicians and security forces engaged in organised crime under a blanket . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Artic@@ ulo 19 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Artic@@ ulo 19 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published last year more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you die in Mexico because they want you to hold the mouth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said R@@ ami@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously the mur@@ ders have a deter@@ rent effect .
no one forget the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth Mac@@ ias in the northern border of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as a six years ago .
her body was found together with a note that allegedly signed by the Z@@ etas Kartell : &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and headphones lay next to their separate head .
some branches have chosen to close the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border of Ch@@ ihu@@ ah@@ ua for the assassination of the correspondence MI@@ RO@@ S@@ LA@@ VA Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue to do as El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo after the assassination of her director in 2004 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ arez presented itself publicly in the drug map with an editorial on the front page with the heading &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some journalists are escaped from their home states , or even out of the country .
it is a painful decision .
it is hard to find work in exile , and they still observe the streets and search for dangers .
and sometimes they are hun@@ ted how it seems to be assass@@ inated by photograph@@ ers of Reuben Esp@@ in@@ osa , in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who continue to continue and continue the work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra who once wanted to be a poet , gives the drug traff@@ icking to him .
&quot; Mexico goes to hell , and that &apos;s why I became rep@@ orter , &quot; he said .
at midnight , when the last issue was finished , the editors of Ri@@ od@@ ce were sitting on the side@@ walk before the office and drank beer , when all their tel@@ eph@@ ones began to h@@ um .
a number of shooting sites with band @-@ kn@@ uck@@ les and security forces near the Maz@@ at@@ lan site had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war escal@@ ated , as promised by a number of car@@ tel em@@ bas@@ sies in the region .
from the Bord@@ ados , they published the news on the website of Ri@@ o@@ ce over cell phone .
the front page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ rens he@@ ul@@ ls near - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the c@@ ops , keeping watch to see if they were in will@@ ingness .
if they were afraid , they didn &apos;t show it .
under the massive portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for quite S@@ inal@@ oa , the staff of Ri@@ o@@ ce followed his traces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you also remember &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If on the same day , when Javier was murdered , the intern asked me to send them to the road . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dinosau@@ rs used clo@@ ak to sof@@ ten his enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue , even a fri@@ ghtening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now researchers have found out that the first knowledge of incredible rhin@@ o@@ or@@ ns of a Canadian min@@ ers have been so good that experts have described it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of Dinosau@@ rs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was so good that they could even find that his sc@@ aly skin was red@@ dish and they said they had something from a &quot; un@@ troubled past . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Current Biology &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; described him as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the be@@ held dinosau@@ rs ever found , and one of the best dinosau@@ rs specimens of the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the F@@ ossil is a newly discovered type of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier which lived in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ace@@ ous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
his unbelie@@ v@@ ably good condition , researchers , which it as &quot; really remarkable , &quot; entic@@ ed
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ar@@ mo@@ red plant @-@ fres@@ ser is the best preserved F@@ ossil of its kind .
it was found by Shawn Funk , when he died on 21 March 2011 in the Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Murray in the north of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b .
he met something on something from the surrounding rock , and decided to look closer .
the fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to un@@ cover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) heavy cl@@ umping .
after all this hard work , the finished result is ready to be revealed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you only flash a little with the eyes , you could almost believe that it slept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum where the creature is visible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will enter the scientific history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosau@@ rs - the Mon@@ a Lisa of Dinosau@@ rs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
researchers found out that this plant car@@ ni@@ vo@@ res , even though it is covered with arm@@ or and re@@ sembles a changing tank , probably threatened by the car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous dinosau@@ rs .
the heavily ar@@ mo@@ red dinosau@@ rs used a red and white cam@@ ouflage to hide itself from smoking , and used a par@@ atro@@ phy , which is also used as a counter@@ f@@ ist , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have allowed to stir more into its surroundings and avoid its enemies , experts say what it indicates that it was threatened by bigger dinosau@@ rs .
the 110 million years old creature from the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier family has made head@@ lines in May and is now available in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal and it is called Bo@@ re@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli , one of a team that has spent more than 7.000 hours to cover it carefully .
the ast@@ o@@ unding maintenance of the specimen made it possible to document Dr. Mitchell and a international team of scientists , the pattern and the form of shed and arm@@ our over his body .
they discovered the sh@@ ady sh@@ ady , a widespread defence method in the animal kingdom , meaning that the top of the creature has been dar@@ ker than its under@@ side .
although the sh@@ ady sh@@ ady is common , the results are surprisingly , as the size of Bo@@ re@@ op@@ el@@ ta is by far the animals living today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it indicates that the dinosau@@ rs has driven enough pressure through the car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous dinosau@@ rs that the evolution of confron@@ tation was fav@@ oured as a means of survival . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but most contemporary animals that use the sh@@ ady sh@@ ady - remember Re@@ he , zeb@@ ras , or belt @-@ animals - are much smaller and vulner@@ able as prey , which sign@@ alizes that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real struggle for survival .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strong pre@@ dat@@ ory behavior on a massive , strong @-@ cut dinosau@@ rs show how dangerous the dinosau@@ rs ro@@ b should have been the cra@@ yon period , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosau@@ r was brown .
scientists continue to investig@@ ate the animal on his life , including his conservative perform@@ ers to find out what it had eaten as his last meal .
they believe that the dinosau@@ rs , when he died , went into a river , and driven into the sea , where he sank to the sea floor .
at that time , Alberta was so warm as southern fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans are likely to spread far inland than they are today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is remarkable because it is completely covered with conservative skin , but also in three dimensions , it keeps the original form of the animal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that the animal today looks almost as it looks in the early cra@@ yon period . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you don &apos;t need to use much imagination to re@@ build it . if you &apos;re just a bit with the eyes , you could almost believe that he is sleeping . &quot;
the chal@@ k time was a time when huge ther@@ op@@ o@@ ds , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous dinosau@@ rs , which stood on two legs , crossed the earth .
although the king of them , the ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Rex , lived million years after Bo@@ re@@ op@@ el@@ ta , was hun@@ ted to some of his fur@@ ious ancestors .
it belongs to the Acro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long , six tons heavy monsters .
scientists , whose newest knowledge will appear in Current Biology , believe that Bo@@ re@@ op@@ el@@ ta has sun@@ k after death in the sea and m@@ um@@ mi@@ zed in mud .
the creature was found by Shawn Funk , when he died on 21 March 2011 in the Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Murray in the north of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b .
according to the museum it is the be@@ held dinosau@@ rs of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is complete from the mu@@ zzle to the hip .
the creatures had an average of 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and have weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .

in the thunder@@ storm : mass ar@@ amb@@ ol@@ age on the A8 : many injured
heavy accident on the A8 : nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a mass ar@@ amb@@ ol@@ age .
there are numerous injured , kilomet@@ ers@@ - and G@@ aff@@ er .
on the highway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A8 ) on the late afternoon afternoon by a mass ar@@ amb@@ ol@@ age about 20 people were injured .
according to the police , the police officers were between 17.00 o &apos;clock between the junction of Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( District of A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a storm of just 30 vehicles , including trucks and trucks .
about the exact number of injured parties do not have any data disclos@@ ed .
it is a light to moderate injuries , said a police pre@@ cher .
a large array of rescue vehicles was at the accident site .
the A8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich .
in the direction of Munich , a ten kilometres long retreat was formed .
as a AZ rep@@ orter reports , it came also on the road to massive disabilities - by numerous gre@@ aff@@ er .
the fire brig@@ ade not@@ ched the license plates , which now have to be reck@@ oned with delicate pun@@ ishments .
shortly after 18 : 45 , a second accident happened in the A8 , time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
there was a coll@@ ision between a car transporter and passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to accident .
Deutsche Bahn : group tests &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot;
it &apos;s a moment that almost everyone has already experienced : nothing is sitting on the train and sleeps .
or you have deep@@ ened in his work and has just a brilliant thought .
and then : pu@@ ff@@ f .
comes the Schaff@@ ner and w@@ akes up an impro@@ per or tears the g@@ ast in the midst of the workflow .
ticket control .
but the times of inter@@ ru@@ ptions are over soon .
the German rail@@ ways are currently testing the Aven@@ ger chassis control .
simply by using the mobile phone , you simply have to be taken and evalu@@ ates the ticket to its location .
a test run is currently running on two routes .
&quot; the offer is coming , we reach it out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is expected to be available in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a railway spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls the track to the ticket rating without Schaff@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to use them , however , some conditions have to be met : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to have an online ticket - what already most passengers do .
it also has to be bought over the app by train , DB Navigator , which is the most convenient type of ticket booking anyway .
and last , you need a seat reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works like : one asc@@ ends to the train , calling its ticket among &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My tickets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the test customers then appears a button for the electronic evaluation .
the train companion are on their mobile devices a message that Pass@@ g@@ ast X is located in the train and has taken a seat of the Y .
if the train companion is on position Y , he knows that there is a passenger with the already installed online ticket .
so , you can sleep on , continue to keep silent .
the &quot; Check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn should use the passengers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who wants to relax without ticket inspection by our train service personnel checked in the DB Navigator simply . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this allows the passengers to create their travel time in the train personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , DB @-@ Marketing Management Board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our staff have more time than today to go on individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who are often rides , know that next to delays and missed trains will include the ticket inspec@@ tions to the biggest sleeves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for often , in any case , one of the mit@@ ig@@ ation do not have any documents which you need to dev@@ alu@@ ation from online tickets . &quot; &quot; &quot;
either credit card or ID card or otherwise a document needed .
the result are endless discussions between train companion and g@@ ast , which leads to bad mood in part or large space and delays in control of your own tickets and taking the Schaff@@ ner at the end the time takes care of taking care of other concerns .
only a small number of test@@ ers can use the new service .
and this only applies to the ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart @-@ Essen connections .
further rail numbers on the same route are not yet un@@ locked .
as an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 , Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rell was shaken up to its core .
only one day after having arrived in New York City , the St. Louis building was sitting on the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment , which she rented and sc@@ rolling through Facebook on their phone .
she stum@@ bled upon a post of somebody from High School .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police had just killed an 18 year old child , and it still lies on the street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused as nobody else post@@ pon@@ ed the information on her feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ ph@@ aro@@ ah has continually saved on their tim@@ eline .
the Rap@@ per from the area of St. Louis was , the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old man , who was killed by a white polic@@ eman in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , was killed live .
he posted a picture of Brow@@ ns &apos;s empty body , which was stretched out on the road and would stay there for four hours .
&quot; this is wild , &quot; said Fer@@ rell to himself .
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she took her mobile phone to return to twe@@ ets over people on the Can@@ field Drive .
there were photos of the police band and people , the cried , and from a man who claimed to be Brow@@ ns &apos;s father , who claimed a sign with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ ons police has just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she observed a live feedback , where a polic@@ eman stood before a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bar@@ king dog .
in another video , she said , a other polic@@ eman secured his rif@@ le , crying , &quot; I will kill you ... animals all kill . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not common , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell re@@ minded of their testimony . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the kind of murder , which we have acc@@ ust@@ omed to us and that we can call typical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that moment , I felt ch@@ ills .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was angry and wept . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after landing at 23 o &apos;clock , she fet@@ ched her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two were driving to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning .
what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the topic of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in cinemas from 11 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a story of survival , love and loss of loss , strength and resistance , who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a he@@ w with her daughter , who carried a flower dress and a suitable crown , after F@@ erg@@ us@@ on drove , the two had a conversation that she had played countless times before this morning &quot; about the black experience and the black state . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember how I have taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they remember what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that wasn &apos;t right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I could not take her away , &quot; said Fer@@ rell .
&quot; what happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past .
it must know and see it and be moved .
it must be well developed , not only ac@@ ti@@ vis@@ m and organization but also know the different layers of the black experience and the black Constitution and what we have to do to free ourselves .
even though I &apos;m lucky to give you an experience , in which they are personally liable to an ec@@ lec@@ tic rac@@ ism , it is not different from the next black women child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have the feeling I would give you a bad service to keep them away from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first station when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on was at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority , which was waiting for a camp@@ ground , as the activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ charge of officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there Fer@@ rell and her daughter joined with a local business partner who made lunch .
they prepared bags before and hal@@ ves to pass them on demonstr@@ ators .
slowly a new type of ac@@ ti@@ vis@@ m began to take shape for Fer@@ rel shape .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my ac@@ ti@@ vis@@ m has changed totally after August 9th , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ souri @-@ St. Louis the president of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on eating justice and health ine@@ qualities in black con@@ greg@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
it has come all . &quot;
weeks later , Fer@@ rell met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , a co @-@ directors of the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her comra@@ des Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ rar wanted to document &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; what happened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a question came to Fer@@ rell : &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story you can explo@@ it ? &quot;
this ske@@ p@@ tic@@ ism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often of wh@@ ites in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently said in an interview : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that people who were born in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on and raised their voices , and we wanted to do it differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
following the time co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis worked together with the former co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist known for his ac@@ ti@@ vis@@ m around To@@ dest@@ ra@@ ct .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his commitment brought the project closer together with six other natives the team of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; followed the years after Brow@@ ns . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us . we speak , &quot; said Davis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the main thing for me how these people are represented , because so I will be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the goal was to concentrate on Fer@@ rel@@ ls &apos;s experience - in order to show that it is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not about a Messi@@ ah &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; movement , but about a community that comes together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - she proved to be the most obvious participant in the film . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a result , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of fer@@ rel@@ ls life , as she falls in love and married her wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell and laughed , when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understood that there must be certain vulner@@ ability during this work and in the de@@ human@@ ization of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Fer@@ rel@@ ls Story the role of black gay women in the wider black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ mat@@ ter movement .
two of the three founders of the Movement , who co@@ ined the movie &quot; Black@@ li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media in 2012 , identi@@ fies the movie &quot; Black@@ li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media .
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement in total , &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; and so we are constantly strug@@ gling on different fron@@ ts .
black , gay women must bear the main burden of everything . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; fol@@ ay@@ an approved that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Movement really is held out of black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it is insist@@ ing that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not an affir@@ m@@ ative type of action , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Fer@@ rell has been selected as a heart of the movie . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she was the person who shook this energy , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not a co@@ incidence , though it was on the fore@@ front , because with a life on these crosses as a black , gay woman is so much on the game . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can sense your energy through the screen . &quot;
meanwhile , news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on has long disappeared , but the ra@@ cial connections between the church and the police are still ongoing .
Fer@@ rell has a demonstration on a motorway with a demonstration for 2 ½ years due to blocking a highway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she describes the soci@@ o @-@ political atmosphere of the area they called their home : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chaos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , they compl@@ ained to a vocals and she feels committed to this memory since they went to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on three years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is our duty to win .
we need to love and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : TV readers discuss about Bit Gallery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bit gallery moves the people although they are not built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping centre on the South of the pedestrian zone has since its first presentation in 2009 the population in advoc@@ ates and opponents .
cold makes the issue hardly any one .
the subject is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; as they say to a bit gallery : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this would be a dream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Nicole Becker ) or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would be really great &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t need a person &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ occupy ) or quite simply : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; size &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while advoc@@ ates are building a gallery of more customers in the city , the other business also benefits , the opponents fear that the pedestrian area is bleeding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore : the gallery will be held exactly on the property , on which the farms market stands , in the 13 direct market share their products .
the start of construction works will be final .
the Gallery M@@ acher want to integrate a market hall in the new building - and to Bed@@ a @-@ Platz with possibility of sitting out .
Simone Zimmer : &quot; we &apos;ve been buying almost weekly in the farmers market for many years .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the land@@ wives are always very happy .
we have also discovered the but@@ cher shop for us .
we would wish that even during and above all , there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is also .
especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ensing : &quot; whether the directors will settle in a market hall in the gallery , the amount depends on the rent .
but this is likely to be low in the new project . &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; why shopping remains in Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothing , shoes , dro@@ pping or supermarket : I find the superf@@ lu@@ ous .
there is enough of them in our city .
you see how many Lad@@ y@@ stores are empty here - some have been for months and years .
but since there is not even a decent weekly market , it is the more important that at least the market hall has been preserved .
because after all , the goods offered there is fresh , mostly offered directly from the producer and is very cheap .
as you see , shop transactions are rented in a shopping centre only by larger companies , because the rented rentals are often not portable for retailers .
too bad , specialty stores are almost no more and what remains of it , will probably disappear . &quot;
Wolf Fan@@ del : &quot; a shopping center with a market hall fits me not together .
and the gallery doesn &apos;t fit into Bit@@ burg .
above all : where should the farmers market during the construction period ?
the old E@@ DE@@ KA would be the solution - even in duration if the bit Gallery is actually coming .
or will it be able to drive the ghost @-@ gallery before , all shops from Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; it just won &apos;t work .
and a shopping center that is empty , no one needs .
in my opinion , it would have been better to promote a proper farmer market instead of this gallery .
but for a pe@@ asant market hall , it is thanks to the crazy many - how I find - sensual construction projects in Bit@@ burg no more place .
when the pe@@ asant market is captured , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ings DNA
in the middle of the space of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York are many faces to see - white , black and brown , which almost im@@ measur@@ ably hang on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg with che@@ eks t@@ aps and hair@@ cut , which were sent to them by Chelsea M@@ anning .
M@@ anning sent out the excer@@ pts from the Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where the former intelligence service analy@@ st was a 35 @-@ year prison sentence , after they openly made diplomatic messages about the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website .
the new exhibition opened on 2 August is called A Bec@@ oming Res@@ em@@ bl@@ ance ( A suitable simil@@ arity ) .
she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline was transformed in technology , computer science and art , and M@@ anning , a trans@@ gression and pione@@ ering dis@@ sident , when he was only three days in his office .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has been created by the algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA that could be extracted from the 30 portraits , such as someone could be interpreted using these genom@@ ic data - the many wise as they can be interpreted and the inher@@ ent det@@ er@@ min@@ ism of these inter@@ pret@@ ations - but also to identity .
M@@ anning , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , has already been spoken openly about identi@@ fying as a wife , was convicted of 20 charges in 2013 , including six violations of the spy law , computer fraud and theft .
through the prison their painting was supp@@ ressed so much that there was only one photo - a grain , black @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which M@@ anning visi@@ bly un@@ comfortable on a driver &apos;s seat and a plat@@ in@@ blonde v@@ aul@@ ted - with which it was associated .
in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came from the great success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Vis@@ ions &apos; .
in it , the artist produced portraits of strangers from for@@ en@@ sic arti@@ facts like cigarette st@@ acks and che@@ wing gum , by extrac@@ ting the DNA from the waste to make a picture of what these people might look like .
this was the time they received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they led an interview with Chelsea M@@ anning while she was in prison , and they wanted to accompany a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg with a press preview of the new exhibition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed , so they took contact with Chelsea and asked her whether she wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and its imprisoned M@@ use became un@@ equal to un@@ equal letters , which carried out several letters in the course of two years .
they even created a cartoon by Sho@@ ili can@@ y@@ ons , &quot; Supp@@ ose images , &quot; who would pre@@ dict a future in which the president of Chel@@ seas would be able to see the exhibition personally .
that Obama actually was only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ings release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas , was a welcome kind of happy meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is also a bit deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition , since Donald Tr@@ ump leads a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camps and against trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ ez@@ ers , which he actually should fix . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked for the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things come from a certain reason . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a wall of the gallery of the gallery , M@@ anning with its superior signature ( the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; i &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in their family name is provided with a heart ) an end of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automatic sm@@ ashing , its foundation sex , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the opposite wall is her mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thou@@ sand@@ al of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hopes to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nu@@ cle@@ ot@@ ide after the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist ) , as amaz@@ ingly similar , at least in biological ways , all of us are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what people will hopefully take care of that our gen@@ ome takes care of what we are and how openly genetic data for a interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video works of 2007 , Sp@@ ur@@ ious Mem@@ ories , too . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , hence the 30 of these stories . &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in a separate room , is a page from the mentioned Comic @-@ Nov@@ el mentioned above .
she shows M@@ anning , as she emerges with a release of hands in the United States , such as King Kong .
&quot; if they ch@@ ill your speech , then they have won , &quot; says it .
&quot; so never stop the mouth . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter which she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist to greet the Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ um@@ ps if I speak about it . &quot;
M@@ anning has not yet seen the exhibition at the Com@@ ic@@ book - but if they were supposed to do it , then it will be welcomed in the center of space from their own genom@@ ic simulation , which collec@@ ts themselves like hor@@ des of protest@@ ers .
that was also aimed at how everything was written in the exhibition until the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ings St@@ ature ) , where their genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups were written with a pencil .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past I had done it on the wall , but I wanted to feel like a crowd , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portraits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted to feel that it feels like a mass movement , which formed itself with Chelsea , like the movement that was also behind her liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
University of Nor@@ th@@ western and an employee of the University of Oxford for murder
a nationwide human hunt is underway for a professor at Nor@@ th@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford who were sought to susp@@ ect a man in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries .
on Monday , for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham L@@ ath@@ em ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) arrest warran@@ ts due to their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , the acts of the municipal court of Cook County .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , passed away after several stit@@ ches .
a local warning system published by the Chicago Police Authority that the body was discovered on July 27 .
officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victims with several injuries to his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still declared on the spot of events for dead , and det@@ ective investig@@ ates the stit@@ ches as murder while the police search for the two susp@@ ects , said officials .
L@@ ath@@ em has been an exceptional professor of Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at Nor@@ th@@ western University since 2007 .
Alan K. Cub@@ bage , the vice @-@ president for university relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that L@@ ath@@ em must now be excluded and excluded from the campus of Nor@@ th@@ western University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal matter that is studied by the competent authorities and the Nor@@ th@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cub@@ bage said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man for the University and the Som@@ erv@@ ille College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in contact with the police in Britain in contact and ready to help US investig@@ ative authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the statement added that War@@ ren colleagues were shocked and want to set him out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
chief Communications Officer at Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he demands the susp@@ ect to meet the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police has an idea of their residence , and our efforts to locate it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities will help finding the susp@@ ect .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said , the police received a call from the building super@@ visor of the Grand @-@ Plaza building that had just given an en@@ ig@@ matic tip that was something happened in apartment 100@@ 8 .
the police described the scene as very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was un@@ clear whether the incident took place on July 27th .
it was confirmed by security cameras that L@@ ath@@ em and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victims had a relationship , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the management team of Grand Plaza published an explanation of the inhabitants : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police currently works on the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim and research a multitude of mot@@ if@@ s , including a possible domestic product . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we will conclude the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; - the Russian Vice @-@ Chancellor Mut@@ ko
the Russian Vice @-@ Chancellor , Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko , said it will not last long until the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented for restoration of the Russian Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a certain stage of fulfilling the criteria of the road@@ map R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with UK@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the WA@@ DA timetable has been updated in this regard , &quot; Mut@@ ko explained on Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the PM commented on the second part of the WA@@ DA road@@ map to comply with the criteria for the re@@ introduction of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA , and recently published on the website of the organization . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Mut@@ ko he doesn &apos;t contain anything for Russia to concern concern .
&quot; everything has been announced , everything is converted .
and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; he added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the criteria mentioned in the list stated that the Russian Anti @-@ D@@ oping authorities appro@@ ve the reported results of the WA@@ DA approved by the Canadian attorney Richard McLaren on a state @-@ funded d@@ oping in Russian sports publicly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in terms of the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we carry out the test because our anti @-@ d@@ oping system has put an error . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there were no state programs , and we will not admit anything that doesn &apos;t exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mut@@ k@@ os words voted with those of Vit@@ aly Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v , the leader of the independent Russian Anti @-@ D@@ oping Commission .
in conversation with the Russian sales office R@@ Sport at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v had problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping organizations , but added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .
no one has prior to accept this report un@@ conditional , &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v .
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded in November 2015 in the scope of D@@ oping sc@@ and@@ als by WA@@ DA by the execution of d@@ oping controls in Russia .
however , to plan and coordin@@ ate the tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( UK@@ AD ) .
after a visit to the headquarters of the headquarters in Moscow in July , WA@@ DA General Director Olivier Nig@@ gli declared that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has moved &quot; into the right direction , &quot; to be used again .

the Start @-@ ups that will help your company will not become the next U@@ ber
Amy Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to compete with your staff at your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the surveys did not work .
answers were often vag@@ ue , little helpful , or even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent .
and even if you promised An@@ on@@ ym@@ ity , some workers did not trust the process .
&quot; there was just never consist@@ ency and objec@@ tivity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care Society Madison Re@@ ed .
she called people out of the outside .
a new race of Human Resources Start @-@ ups is at Wach@@ sen to help companies find out how their employees feel .
through the creation and licensing of software that has the specific purpose of the measurement of employees , it allows companies to list angi@@ ym@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers allow to circum@@ vent the C @-@ Suite managers and turn directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; you now have tools like Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for the persecution of their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analy@@ tics tools are used by companies to measure employees .
Er@@ ret@@ t said they have a better insight into what your employees think and feel won with G@@ lin@@ t in the three years .
in addition to the S@@ nap @-@ surveys and surveys conducted by certain teams , it offers a heat map of the company which shows most of the units most of the complaints , and which exec@@ u@@ tives have low tuning results - so that you can drill bits , why .
companies come to see that at the fore@@ front of the workplace culture , so that you won &apos;t have a blog post that has been published in Sk@@ and@@ als since then a former employee has published a blog post , which describes a field of har@@ ass@@ ment , in which those who have spoken have been punished .
for Start @-@ ups such as G@@ lin@@ t , this wish is a lu@@ cr@@ ative business possibility .
the global govern@@ ance , regulation and compliance industry could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion value by 2020 , following the financial technical website let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , start @-@ up Conver@@ cent , the company helps to avoid bad behavior and to identify , looked an increasing interest and activity in the beginning of this year in the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alle in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
converting has almost 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tesla .
u@@ ber has recently signed as a client .
like G@@ lin@@ t , Conver@@ cent Company offers custom &quot; pulse &quot; p@@ olls , collect confi@@ dential responses in real time and view the warmth maps of your problem areas .
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line , which allows employees to report a bad behavior .
and if the main managing director is included , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judgment of public opinion has recorded reg@@ ul@@ ators , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Patrick Quin@@ lan , founder and managing director of Conver@@ cent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a company is found that his employees are badly treated or in@@ eth@@ ically , it can experience costly consequences by consumers &apos; boy@@ cott , workers &quot; flight , &quot; Quin@@ lan said .
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites , Conver@@ cent has been used for more than one year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have an easy way to achieve their corporate headquarters .
previously , if a employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a telephone number or e @-@ mail for the company &apos;s headquarters , a formal complaint that he was taken seriously .
it was often an in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation and un@@ comfortable experience , &quot; said James Vit@@ rano , Ruby TU@@ ES@@ DA@@ YS General Coun@@ sel , who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , as the company Conver@@ ts , you can find problems that were in offices in cities or states that were hidden in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or un@@ fair internship . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I can get closer to this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view into the experience with employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who guides the risk management group from Ruby Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment law . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies began to take Eth@@ ics , Val@@ ues and Emplo@@ ye@@ e @-@ Commit@@ ment in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen , due to eth@@ ic due to the Enron sc@@ andal , said Quin@@ lan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it took until the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social media came to their right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that companies realized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry online . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; before using technology to monitor eth@@ ics , people used to be a strategy , &quot; he said .
both G@@ lin@@ t and Conver@@ cent offer your software as service , and debit companies with recur@@ ring charges for use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance to find the approval of Venture Capital investors , which are both start@@ ups supported .
Conver@@ cent received $ 10 million in financing in February of companies such as Sapphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , with which the entire capital has been raised to $ 47 million .
the company secured $ 10 million in November by Bes@@ se@@ mer Venture Partners and brought his total funding to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising , in view of the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more employees than previously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley are high levels and interesting projects only .
staff want to feel that you are accepted and estimated that you will give your time a company with a positive mission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if people are happy to be in a company , the work that you do is worth doing , then you feel stronger to do this company , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Benef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience in Lin@@ ke@@ d@@ In , which uses both Conver@@ cent and G@@ lin@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot;
investors reach returns if their portfolio company are running well . companies run well when employees are active and engaged .
when the Analytics Tools promise third parties , dedication and commitment to the employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the data on staff commitment according to the experts of the workplace culture is important .
but the data is useless if the ste@@ war@@ ter of a company does not take action .
in fact , if a company asks employees according to your feedback , it can have a anticip@@ ation that change is on the way .
and if the change does not come fast enough , or not at all , this can be dis@@ illu@@ sion@@ ed and motivated .
&quot; if you are asking for 4.000 suggestions , you have to be ready to have 4.000 talks , &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at Business Management company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen the company too much on collecting data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you don &apos;t follow the staff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Will you really hear me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about that ?
and whom don &apos;t care about why should I take ? &quot;
Madison Re@@ ed , who now runs a monthly employee p@@ olls , was able to lead measures in the same day if a problem is reported via G@@ lin@@ t , so res@@ cu@@ t .
and after collecting feedback from fru@@ str@@ ated employees , it was able to re @-@ organize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to deal with the problems .
on Ruby Tuesday the company has always received new insights into the staff , and hopes for a long term , this leads to a better binding of employees in a branch that is known for high sales .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose men , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and if you lose humans , you will also lose customers .
and if you lose customers then you will lose company .
the N@@ CAA removes the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the Bru@@ ins
it goes to 23 o &apos;clock when a lot of U@@ CL@@ A football player on one side of the new exercise fields of the team are enter@@ tained in campus .
some have drawn their tri@@ cot tops and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team , this is a lunch break .
players who are enrolled in the summer courses will return after the three @-@ hour exercise before they return next morning at 6 : 30 to the Water@@ man Football Center next morning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is for the guys the next three days a real Tre@@ t@@ mill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before the Monday to Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CAA elimin@@ ates two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the burden of players , and it has leng@@ th@@ ened its days - at least until the final on Friday .
this is why the first three training sessions of U@@ CL@@ A should start at 19 : 15 to meet the already packed time units of the player .
the compromise away from the two days is more than a day that the Bru@@ ins were post@@ pon@@ ed after a week after the last season , during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six game times in West@@ wood .
they are going to keep 18 exercises in the course of August . 20 before the start of formal toys preparations for their start at Texas A &amp; M in September .
MOR@@ A told that he supports the rule of the N@@ CAA support even if they add another point to the player &apos;s most busy routes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this enormous strain on them three or four days on them , and it is very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they have done it simply , they plac@@ ard further , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think when we come to Saturday and we have more time , it &apos;s really great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U@@ CL@@ A will end its practices , as soon as the camp is termin@@ ated , in view of the clear view of its fields marked by an adjacent parking lot and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the up@@ stream , which cleared a protective network behind a door posts , which will be no easy task .
brood @-@ ins should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a cle@@ ars to give it a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; Mor@@ a said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far to think that people would rent a room there and then set out to record a exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have a video from one exercise , it &apos;s quite a good deal .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
I am not too much worried about that .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts in the fight against counter@@ feit messages
Facebook wants to send more potential items to third parties by third parties and their findings under the original contribution , said the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of its efforts to fight so @-@ called f@@ ake news .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company said in a statement on his website that it will begin with the use of updated educational methods to identify possible mis@@ ses and display them at fac@@ ulty checks from the original article . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Facebook was critic@@ ised as one of the main points for so @-@ called f@@ ake @-@ news , many of which believe that they also have influenced the US presidential elections in 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the problem has become a major political issue in Europe , where French voters are overwhel@@ med with false stories in May , and Germany will not be able to get a plan according to social media networks , as they fail to eliminate h@@ asser@@ filled post@@ ings as before elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday Facebook spoke in a separate statement on German that in the United States , France , the Netherlands and Germany , a test of new facts will be launched .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to knowledge , which stories of fac@@ tions are foc@@ uss@@ ed on third parties , people want to read and share things about what they read and share , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sara Su , Product manager for Facebook messages in a blog . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that Facebook will continue to test its feature &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in connection with article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and working on other changes to its news feed , to decrease false news . &quot; &quot; &quot;
creating a Comic @-@ novel : a Castle in the History of England
in his recent past the little Scot@@ ney Castle was to be seen in a sque@@ eze musical video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ s and 1980 @-@ 1980 .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from its cozy seat in the ir@@ l River valley in K@@ ent and is now inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , an mop@@ ha@@ ired Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a pre@@ ference for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I find it so beautiful to watch the hand@@ writing of someone who is dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &quot; sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages up to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scot@@ ney . every story was illustrated by another , upcoming British artist , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Green@@ berg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des based on an archive : he wrote 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection that inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found un@@ exp@@ ec@@ tedly emotional .
&quot; I only re@@ acts on the thumb@@ print on the side of a letter which was written by a double @-@ party in the 1700 &apos;s , he worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says .
&quot; it is his Dau@@ men@@ ab@@ druck !
and Let@@ ters always smell up to smoke , because at that time a fire was kind@@ led because of light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has a effect as if he himself would be .
Oh , I love Archive ! &quot;
for someone who is so familiar with old papers that he was supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council , England , and for almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : &quot; this seems to be nice to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Vic@@ tor@@ ian &quot; new &quot; castle , to study the archives and study the many treasures and curi@@ os@@ ities of the castle , such as the mon@@ oton@@ ous hy@@ ena on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the dit@@ ch .
he mig@@ rated through the grounds and ruins of the old castle , and spoke with landscape @-@ care , gar@@ dener and sometimes with artists , who worked on the illustrations of his book .
then , at night , he drank &quot; Whis@@ key &quot; and started to write . &quot;
the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown since the National Trust received full access in 2006 when the last Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
when Rho@@ des met a decade later , the employee began to take care of the archive , which he as &quot; hundreds of years , in which ar@@ ist@@ oc@@ ats said &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; di@@ aries , letters from the time of English Emp@@ ires , maps that represent what had been boring : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one could think that country conflicts would be boring , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to fight for two families . &quot; &quot; &quot;
guys , let everything go through ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection are using the castle as a starting point to enter a bro@@ ader base in the English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , who leaves the newly built castle to join the farm@@ stead of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a record of a ri@@ ot that stood in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book entitled &apos; Kn@@ igh@@ tly Family &apos; of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , says Rho@@ des .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the farmers started in this area and I thought that an uprising was a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
maybe the two are linked together ? &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - as &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ ter , hidden the family of Dar@@ rell seven years during the English Reformation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; , presented in which the s@@ mu@@ g@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ rell , portra@@ yed his own fun@@ eral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later when his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) .
the Dar@@ rel@@ ls are Rho@@ des &apos;s favorite family from Scot@@ ney : &quot; gent@@ lemen seemed to be quite a must have debts and spending money for things that they could not afford .
other generations of Dar@@ rell @-@ men qu@@ en@@ ligh@@ ten their debt , by marriage , I imagine it as a bunch of well @-@ looking guys , with a talent to advert@@ ise an inheritance . &quot;
after the end of its use in the castle , Rho@@ des is searching for other unique scre@@ aming experiences
he has brought a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about E@@ lä@@ män@@ mo@@ ki behind them , the grounds of a devast@@ ation from the early 20th century , which has ever been demanded by nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to cope with the dam@@ ned life again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign started : cover over 300 years old Mari@@ ou@@ del in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the cover of the 301 years old Mari@@ ou@@ el in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f has launched its campaign for the introduction of a new umbrella brand ( Rundschau from Thursday ) .
until Thursday Mayor Otto N@@ EU@@ HO@@ FF and his marketing team want to hold his logo and the slogan .
at the end of August , there will be a highlight of the campaign a celebration on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; to be beautiful for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ask the makers of the action since yesterday on posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dor@@ fer Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t think this ( of course ! ) do not really think , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; write it on their last page . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but we use this measure to attract your attention .
and to make clear that many things are better than it seems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; basically , we are the firm belief that we know as Bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer citizens to know the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in action there is more than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is true to form@@ ulate a single promise , one that gives the city a distinctive omni@@ presence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
finally , they stand in competition with other mun@@ icipalities .
a central five @-@ digit amount can be found by the City Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f to the new umbrella brand and the campaign .
military re@@ forms in Turkey - pean@@ ut fears in front of the army
every year in the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) advis@@ es pension funds and funding in the officer cor@@ ps .
this week also this week .
at first glance a normal operation .
but nothing is routine about the Turkish armed forces a year after the coup attempt .
the session did not take place in the building of the General Staff , as earlier , but in the office of the Prime Minister .
under the presidency of the government , there were also five Deputy Head and the Minister for Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs .
these were civilians in the Y@@ AS in the over@@ count .
the government draws the bre@@ wing in the military .
general Staff Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the commander of the army , the Air Force and the Navy were ab@@ stain@@ ed .
since the failed Cou@@ p , President Erdogan has fired 326 the 326 gener@@ als and Admir@@ als .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged links to the exile Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , to the Erdogan as dra@@ h@@ tz@@ er of the coup .
about 4@@ 86 persons , which should have been involved directly on the attempt attempt , is negoti@@ ated in Ankara since this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already on the day after the coup , Erdogan had called the overthrow test as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; divine gift , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because he had to give him the opportunity to clean the armed forces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but does Erdogan really have the army to handle ?
in late February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article entitled &quot; Dis@@ comfort in the Military Head@@ quarters . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the general staff , there are concerns of an increasing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the army that manifest themselves in the lifting of the head@@ scarf ban on soldiers , wrote the newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at any rate , the wholesale guards in the army and security forces continue to work .
in mid @-@ July Erdogan ordered further 73@@ 95 officials , among them 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers .
it seemed , when Erdogan claimed the military .
the gener@@ als earlier than the actual masters of the country .
th@@ rice p@@ utsch@@ es her role as a gu@@ ardi@@ ans of the world leaders .
after his election victory in 2002 , Erdogan urged the power of the military step back to the reform of the reform of the European Union .
former officers say that Erdogan drive targeted specifically to Islam@@ ization of the forces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he was seeking asylum in fear of persecution against persecution abroad , and the Turkish army will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full of extrem@@ ists and Sal@@ af@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if this applies to , such development could not allow Nato to be cold .
anyway , in the alliance , there are doubts about the use of the Turkish army .
the leadership structures and operational skills be &quot; weak@@ ened &quot; say Nato diplom@@ ats .
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Donald Tr@@ ump , quoted from the media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he fore@@ sees to reduce legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter regulations for long @-@ term working permit and limitations for families @-@ oriented vis@@ as .
the new rules are proposed by the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill should be discussed in both chambers of Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and billion dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers , and will do this by the US to be issued in the way as citizens from other countries of Green Cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent chains @-@ migration and replace the current system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this new candidate procedure will come to the candidates who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that are good to our economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted from the American media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ministry wants to san@@ e distance for racing collector shuttle
over the past months , over the future of the race , sh@@ utt@@ les had been con@@ tested - now it should go very fast .
even before the end of the year , the tourist train is scheduled to be built .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to secure the future of the race , according to information from the Austrian Ministry of Transport , the road will start construction work this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the decision to further ordering the Ilmenau @-@ racing circuit , the country is mainly responsible for tourism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the state Secretary Klaus S@@ üh@@ l declared on Friday in Erfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs for the repair of the route increased to about 2.5 million euros .
from this sum , the country take 75 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the contract on which the shuttle should also be ordered from the country , at present , S@@ üh@@ l explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ministry and the Southern Rail@@ ways as operator belong to the technical details already .
&quot; this means that the road@@ map , which used vehicles and quality standards , &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l .
the planned agreement between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
this means that the racing game Shuttle will be ordered regularly on December 2017 .
the racing game Shuttle is a popular railway connection between the railway stations of Ilmenau and racing .
during the last months in the course of a pilot plant , whether the distance of plenty of people is used to order them again in the future .
the route is also in parts strongly .
the rise of sex robots is real , and we should be worried
just as you thought that 2017 may not be a crazy , a new report on technological developments in the area of sex robots .
yes , indeed .
sex robots are currently a big thing .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ) ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , Emer@@ itus Professor of Robotics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at She@@ ff@@ ield University and co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we have to start taking their asc@@ ension seriously .
customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of ni@@ pp@@ le and type of fing@@ ern@@ ails .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people are making fun of them , but the company provide lots of it , and we will see them much more often , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Shar@@ key in the publication of his new report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern S@@ out@@ u@@ ppen have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone , which feels warm - with deliber@@ ately human reactions which can be achieved through the artificial intelligence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the user can also adapt his robot according to its beliefs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and select everything from the eye color of the robot over the form of ni@@ pp@@ le to type or colour of his fing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is still wor@@ rying as many robots have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; person@@ alities &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which would look like a step@@ ford woman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern S@@ out@@ u@@ ppen have developed to robots with a silicone .
the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot allows for example to adapt its users to adapt their robots to the properties that are appe@@ aling how for example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then there are the Ro@@ xx@@ xy gold sex robot with pre @-@ programmed person@@ alities such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which medi@@ ates the impression of lit@@ ig@@ ation and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; advent@@ u@@ rous personality &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as well as possible , &quot; is the site of True Compan@@ ion .
so she likes what you like , and she does not like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
during the day , she also has its m@@ oods - just like real people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; it can be tired , fixed on conversation , or it can be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in mood &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many distur@@ bing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace true human relationships - but the under@@ estimated female characteristics to rape when you take a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( means here : ref@@ usal ) Far@@ rah is going on most .
on his website True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator , but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) have a vibr@@ ator , why can men do not have a Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; is it on the website .
however , these sex robots are not only a fet@@ ish or just another sex playing .
their emergence and increasing refin@@ ement point to something dark and deep in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal equality of the sexes as an optional addition to sex with submission .
most men , of course , will not stop sex robots , and while the FR@@ R re@@ members their growing popularity , they still remain in the br@@ ink of consumer culture .
but what trans@@ vers@@ ed out of the edge of the boundary , in terms of the spirit of time , in which we live , be very instruc@@ tive .
and many people are not strange or ins@@ ulting , until they are the free market for this permission .
there is a certain over@@ l@@ apping that these highly developed sex robots occur in a time in which the rights of women are threatened worldwide , in which the White House has a president who has been engaged in having attacked women sexually .
the sc@@ rap@@ es@@ est aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the maid &apos; ) are not the graphic images , the worn body and the gone eyes but how realistic this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a jump , but in the moment it doesn &apos;t feel like a great leap .
the goal behind this sex robot is to produce physical simil@@ arity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( though with Por@@ nost@@ ar Pro@@ por@@ tions ) .
their gro@@ wers want to feel human , that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but , on the point , when it comes to their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; person@@ alities &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; robots represent no real women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they can not separate from their companion or go away .
they have no placement or a background story , nothing that could inter@@ fere in independence or anything , which could inter@@ fere with the imagination .
expressed differently : they are counter@@ f@@ ty slaves .
or to express it in the language of 2017 : maid
Tr@@ um@@ ps big performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney as the ep@@ it@@ ome of healthy human beings
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has become a binary of the tr@@ ump @-@ era that the political divisions that the US voters have split up the US voters , even families in the small format . &quot; &quot; &quot;
around Christmas and Ern@@ te@@ dan@@ k@@ fest there were newspapers with advice about how to handle the hor@@ ror of Tr@@ ump @-@ chosen relatives .
we rig@@ ate ourselves every supp@@ os@@ edly to place our filter bubbles .
the power of Tr@@ um@@ ps , Famili@@ es has been less not@@ ices .
I chose this because my c@@ ousin , a left @-@ left po@@ et@@ ess , who lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the rep@@ ublic@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they re@@ minded me that the unity of a common enemy can have a powerful effect . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with Tr@@ ump in the White House , everyone who knows them , including the rep@@ ubli@@ can relationship , with whom she fought for decades , suddenly and quite strange on the same side .
for the dining table this is certainly a good thing , but it falls in a further context that this brings too significant risks .
the left was strengthened by p@@ umping , but the effect of its presidency has the power to push us all right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we speak of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and tr@@ ump , we refer to the cre@@ ep@@ y possibility that the kit@@ ten of one day will no longer be thrown away . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , there is still a terri@@ fying long @-@ term scenario , norm@@ alized in the tr@@ ump Rep@@ ublic@@ ans of the right wing , &quot; which suddenly appears in comparison to his standards as the ep@@ it@@ ome of understanding .
I can now find myself from an active nost@@ algia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s hil@@ ari@@ ous version of dec@@ lining - the dog on the car park , but at least we knew how his tax returns ) - which both occur in comparison to tr@@ ump in fact a very mild crime .
if Tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans must be only mentally healthy to qualify as a measur@@ able improvement .
when my c@@ ousin was in the city , we brought our children to car@@ ou@@ sel at Central Park , the largest in the New York State department , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need caffeine .
the horses are huge , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are cris@@ p and the animals twist to look at full fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the cli@@ matic music it convey@@ s this strange way .
as many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ ap@@ point : the views of high buildings will be old , the Sky@@ lines will be familiar to offer a lot of excitement , and the reality of the city is not just the dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I was still not throughout the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss Cottage , the theme pub ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not - but a large roundabout in northern London .
however , Central Park Car@@ ou@@ sel is still a strange magical experience , as here two years old , a 11 @-@ year old and two women in the 40 @-@ year @-@ old can go on it and all have a great time .
if I could have thought the car@@ ou@@ sel , I would have given him a full score , but fortunately no one has asked him .
on the other hand , I was forced to rate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale from one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card .
in the coffee house on the corner of my road , it is the same , plus the option to reduce the average rating with a 15 % ti@@ pping money - this is to buy something about the shop .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this does not only lead to a slow@@ down of what a neutral exchange should actually be , but also put pressure on the server to put personality in a situation where no need is required . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the poor woman in the department store was ap@@ olo@@ red , while I was tired of making my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us moved with chest pain from prison to hospital
Pist@@ ori@@ us has left the prison for a hospital for the second time .
last year he was brought to the hospital for the treatment of Schn@@ itten , who suffered the prison authorities according to a case in his cell .
Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to a first death sentence due to murder on an appeal of the prosec@@ ut@@ ors .
he killed Ste@@ el@@ amp in the early hours of the Valentine &apos;s Day 2013 by taking them several times by a door of the toilet in his house in Pre@@ toria on her .
Pist@@ ori@@ us said that he held his girlfriend for an no@@ c@@ tur@@ nal in@@ tru@@ der that hidden himself in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors announced their intention to put an appeal against the six @-@ year prison sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell which they say , she is too short @-@ sigh@@ ted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the National Criminal Tribunal said that she would raise an ob@@ jection to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the claim can be heard this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us is a danger that his sentence is increased to 15 years when the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
as a farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
the last of the Blum@@ berger schools were put into the holiday homes and E@@ pf@@ en@@ hofen in the holidays and in the continuing schools .
three secondary school students will go to secondary school , four at the secondary school .
school of Angel@@ ika S@@ itte greeted the parents and representatives of the public at the Om@@ es@@ ental House in E@@ pf@@ en@@ hofen .
as a symbol of school@@ ing , the 29 students of the four classes were conducted under the direction of Sophia Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der a young eagle , who grows in the chicken , but then fired in freedom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the m@@ lower Sch@@ ar led a musical to the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Eagle in the poultry &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pe@@ asant Arnold found a strange egg , and sent it away from his chickens .
instead of a poultry dress a small eagle came out .
but hope to make a chicken from him , the eag@@ les spread out his wings on a high mountain , and escaped .
after that , classes three and four in the study of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank showed a chicken dance .
the h@@ ens danced with the young go@@ ose who bore a cylinder to the bet .
the Adler is standing for the integration , the school teacher Angel@@ ika S@@ itte said .
the young was different from the other young ( ch@@ icks ) , but belonged to it .
he will never be like a chicken .
his determination is to be free .
they wished every quad@@ ru@@ iser that he feels in his new school .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was followed by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; than@@ ksgiving to the colleagues , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former school conductor Michael Müller , who also jumps back with lesson courses , and the parents are represented . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cooking time now is over , stated class teachers Sophia Schumacher .
she p@@ ushes her students after two years of teaching only very much , because it was a really great time .
finally , they can rely on the fourth cl@@ utter .
finally , all students have to sound a song from summer time and holiday .
this broke out with the children great joy .
eight first@@ ton@@ ers have already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
two Bulg@@ arians had been detained for illegal camp@@ ings in Greece , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted from television .
on the morning of 1 August , a group of illegal people arrested in Si@@ th@@ onia , including the two Bulg@@ arians .
on the same day they were released , while currently an investigation runs .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported B@@ TV that the Bulg@@ arians were released .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Greek authorities have exac@@ erb@@ ated control of the free camp@@ uses and lay everyone who is found to stay in a place which is not intended for this purpose . &quot; &quot; &quot;
checks are continued throughout the season .
the Ministry said that the court can impos@@ e a fine of fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what people need to know now
how does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers have to participate in action ?
the most important questions and answers .
at the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW group software updates have offered a total of around 5,@@ 3 million cars .
you should improve the emission behaviour of emissions from emissions by Euro 5 and , partly Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ Diesel or worse are excluded .
Anja S@@ met@@ anin of ACE Auto Club Europe are inv@@ alu@@ able :
is the new action compulsory ?
no , the licensed software updates are voluntary .
&quot; the mandatory updates earlier apply only for the vehicles , the Schumann software , &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ anin .
the upgrade was arranged by the Bundes@@ amt ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
the manufacturers have announced a quick implementation in the coming months , but not yet called exact appointment .
Daimler told us to write every person concerned .
if anyway an inspection is due , that is done in their frame .
how long should the change be circul@@ ated altogether ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; S@@ met@@ anin thinks .
the results are from the presence of the manufacturers as well as from political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for we have seen , voluntarily act the car manufacturers on the environment so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long should the update last ?
the upgrade itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
time consuming it could be to get an appointment .
what do drivers do not drive from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW group ?
the ACE advis@@ es you to wait .
presumably , foreign manufacturers would like to move , so S@@ met@@ anin .
is a massive price failure of Euro @-@ 4 @-@ cars ?
the ACE fears that .
but , in the regions , where tickets are threatened .
there are no imp@@ air@@ ments for older diesel in the rural area so far .
the ACE advis@@ es you to wait for sale again .
ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center awards
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glam@@ orous events in Washington .
the first award ceremony under President Tr@@ ump promises to become politically .
one of the winners will not come - from protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) wins as the first ra@@ pper of the prestigious Kennedy Center .
like the cultivation direction on Thursday , singer Gl@@ oria E@@ ste@@ fan ( 59 ) , Li@@ on@@ el Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) , as well as the chore@@ ographer Carmen de Lav@@ all@@ ade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) .
the awards will be handed over in early December .
traditionally , US President Donald Tr@@ ump held a welcome and join his wife Mel@@ ania at the awar@@ ding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Le@@ ar winners announced with progressive TV series are therefore already announced to aband@@ on participation in the gala . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New York Times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This presidency has decided to completely neg@@ lect the arts and human rights - even the remedy - and that bur@@ dened me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 59 @-@ year @-@ old E@@ ste@@ fan stressed , she will use tr@@ ump to make their view clear@@ er .
the Kennedy @-@ centre , named after the former President John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural hub in the US capital .
Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Franklin , Robert De N@@ iro , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing are among the previous winners .
we make the city li@@ vable
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s Urban Buil@@ der , goes into R@@ ente next year .
the place is already written - suitable for applicants are rare .
since 31 years W@@ acker City Buil@@ der is the master builder .
and the work still makes him great fun , as he medi@@ ates in the press conference .
he reports varied , but also demanding tasks that are waiting for its successor .
at the same time , no application has fulfilled the requirement profile .
the city is looking for an architect or construction engineer at the time of time .
so - under regard to the regular notice of cancellation - there is still enough time to be el@@ aboration .
since Has@@ lach has been used for the administrative association as an under@@ e building authority , the applic@@ ant must be appropriate to the applic@@ ant .
because this function wants to keep the city .
if you couldn &apos;t fill this anymore , the citizens would have to go for consultation until Offen@@ burg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the proximity of the city and himself is important to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ acker that is reported by a good company climate and good mood between authority and citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in office more than 30 years ago , some important projects have accumulated , looking back to the h@@ ack@@ ers with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city life worth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is safe about the building and its employees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future diversi@@ fied projects are on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a Are@@ as and the low @-@ car park area around .
the Kin@@ zig@@ brücke between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the stadium restoration is still subject .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter only becomes the latter with about 1.5 million euros , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do it right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ ack@@ ers appreciate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; all in all , great tasks are waiting for my successor .
the work here is fun . &quot;
st@@ aging is present for a city master of great play@@ room .
with Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s own building farm and gar@@ dener , it can be quite flexi@@ bly re@@ acted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one can move a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the h@@ ack@@ ers , and the design of the green spaces are often mentioned by citizens and visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the old town is under monument protection , it is important to have &quot; an eye to have what it fits , &quot; if new@@ builds are approved , st@@ resses the out@@ going town master .
anyway , the Mayor carries high responsibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is a builder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end everything goes over my table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he can count on many years of assistance and coordination : Markus Neum@@ ai@@ er ( high @-@ construction ) has been working for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( Tief@@ bau ) has been working for 15 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also that his successor is long , W@@ acker wishes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are looking for someone who really identi@@ fies and stay in the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
continu@@ ity is not only important for a good enterprise , but also for the other design of the city .
according to the information of the city of Has@@ lach , who would like to exhibit a completed study as a graduate engineer or Bachelor with specialist architecture in the areas of construction and building requirements .
the Stadt@@ bau@@ haus under@@ stands high@@ - and deep @-@ construction , supervision of urban property , municipal property , municipal farm house with building yard and Stadt@@ gär@@ t@@ ner@@ ei as well as Unter@@ e Building Law including monuments .
bicycle on lines cut : south@@ ward route closed
according to the police , the previously unknown cul@@ min@@ ers had thrown the blue bike from the railway track in the area of Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) .
these were so badly damaged , that the coming freight train had to be stopped .
investig@@ ators walk from two male offen@@ ders and look for them since the night .
near the crime scene there were a ro@@ sy sco@@ oter and a bike riders have been observed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond a native of Lausanne , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ö@@ BB spokesperson Christoph Pos@@ ch said to the AP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpet@@ rators or the perpet@@ rators would have brought himself in great danger and endangered the train traffic .
besides the damage at the Lo@@ k and the plant as well as the transfer @-@ minute drive and the costs for rail transport could also come to the crimin@@ als of the railway station .
overall , the speaker said by a &quot; substantial &quot; sum , said the spokes@@ man .
the damage were fixed on Friday afternoon , the railway traffic on the ground line could be guided without disabilities .
almost ten people were enjoying Friday afternoon , two of them entered the district .
goods are not deduc@@ ted , however , they were delayed .
according to Ö@@ BB spokesperson Christoph Pos@@ ch had to be replaced by some 200 metres high pipes .
isol@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help to re@@ lie@@ ve IB@@ D ( Infl@@ amed bo@@ wel disease )
red meat and chocolate may sound for your digest@@ ive system like a night@@ mare .
but a new study claims precisely the opposite : a diet that is rich in flesh @-@ based proteins and dairy products , could reli@@ eving the symptoms of patients with infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory bo@@ wel diseases .
the incur@@ able state that affects approximately 1.3 million and 300,000 in the United Kingdom , causes stomach ul@@ ls and bl@@ ur@@ ities , recur@@ ring or bloody diar@@ rhe@@ a , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
during those affected , meat and dairy products are usually caught in order to re@@ lie@@ ve their symptoms , researchers found the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an of proteins to develop immune cells , which promote a toler@@ ant intest@@ ines .
the senior researchers , Dr. Marco Colonna , explained that immune cells are pat@@ rolling in the intest@@ ine to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes hide in the food , do not enter into the body .
cells , that are unable to resolve inflammation , promote tolerance , promote tolerance , and protect the body without damage to sensitive tissues .
if the balance is too far towards inflammation , it can result in anti @-@ infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory bo@@ wel disease .
in experiments , a kind of tolerance promoting immun@@ o@@ cell in mice found that a particular bacter@@ ium can carry in its initi@@ ates .
and the bacter@@ ium requires tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an - one of the blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of cells .
Professor Colonna said : &quot; we have a link between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ illus reu@@ ter@@ i - that is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ oma , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an had the mice in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and an an tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an abundant nutrition can toler@@ ate less anti @-@ infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory mi@@ lie@@ us if the same system work with people .
the Post@@ doctoral Award in Dr. Lu@@ isa Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan was investig@@ ating that a group of study mice had such cells but a different group of the same tribe , but it had not been accommod@@ ated .
you suspected that the difference had to do with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ oma of mice - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , usually live in the gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract .
the mice of mice were found DNA sequ@@ enced and there were six bacterial species found in mice with immune cells , but without them failed in mice .
mice were raised in a ster@@ ile environment so that they lack@@ ed an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome and did not develop these kinds of immune cells , and they were created by L. reu@@ ter@@ i and Immun@@ e cells .
in order to understand how the bacteria spread on the immune system , the researchers gave L. reu@@ ter@@ i to grow in a liquid and then over@@ took small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ripe immune cells , which were isolated from mice .
the immune cells developed into the toler@@ ant conveyor cells .
when the active component was cleaned out of liquid , it proved to be a by@@ product of tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an Met@@ abol@@ ism that is known as In@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid .
if the researchers have doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an in the feed of mice , the number of cells were hal@@ ved by about 50 percent , but if the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ las@@ h@@ ages were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan said that people have the same toler@@ ant conveyor cells like mice , and that most of us protect L. reu@@ ter@@ i in our gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract .
it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in people like in mice , but defects in relation to tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an were found in people with infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory bo@@ wel disease .
she said : &quot; the development of these cells is probably something we would like to promote , as these cells are inflamm@@ ations on the internal surface of the intest@@ ines .
potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han@@ values in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i lead to an extension of this population . &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United has committed to N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic a &quot; gen@@ ius &quot;
at Manchester United with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic a &quot; gen@@ ius &quot; has signed Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der had his debut against S@@ amp@@ dor@@ ia on Wednesday evening .
the 40 million pounds of Sig@@ nature of Chelsea began with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid starts on Tuesday , and impressed by the holder role as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira according to taste .
however , M@@ atic was excluded from the preparation @-@ Asia tour of the blues and carried only 45 minutes to M@@ our@@ in@@ ho that he had to improve before the start of the Premier League season .
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a gen@@ ius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho .
&quot; we will help him to be ready later . &quot;
in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lind@@ el@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Luk@@ ak@@ u started at the Avi@@ va stadium as M@@ our@@ in@@ ho as his start @-@ XI for the start of the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Independent unveiled this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho still has three other obligations , but he insist@@ ed that the club did a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fantastic job &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to fulfil three of his four primary records . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to get three out of four , I thank the association , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four , but they have given themselves great effort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
the pilots flew away from Seattle in the U.S. state of Washington , but drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state Michigan and moved in the form of a Dream@@ liner via the USA , that &apos;s several thousand kilometres .
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar screen , the form of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole thing was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had already made such public@@ ity earlier .
the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing logo was painted in the sky .
new draft for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
&quot; &quot; &quot; as the wind is turning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still the SPD leader , S &amp; D minist@@ ered minist@@ ered before elections always with some concern to Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a stor@@ my out of the party , only no small wind from the federal government - was thus the most important wish of the v@@ oter turn@@ outs .
since Martin Schulz led the party , the fundament@@ ally has changed .
since then , the employees of the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus is watching the events in the SPD @-@ ruled state capit@@ als .
what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not be described in the approach with head@@ winds .
there were deep suggestions .
and one after another .
after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the Federal CDU saw a general signal against co@@ al@@ itions of the SPD and the Green Party .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows once more : red @-@ green is simply not reliable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said SPD @-@ General Peter Tau@@ ber the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the surprising fra@@ ction of a Green de@@ pu@@ ties has over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) into a severe crisis .
five months before the Sunday election , his red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ vote majority to the opposition from the CDU and F@@ DP .
the Green Party Leader Michael Kell@@ ner urged the off @-@ down Dutch Green Party of El@@ ke T@@ ets to return to their mandate .
the transition to the CDU means a clear failure of voters .
El@@ ke T@@ ets must immediately return its mandate , &quot; said the German Business Administration and Elec@@ toral campaign of the Green Party Editor ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not all true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he sigh@@ ed with an SPD campaign , than on Friday morning the new hi@@ ob@@ s@@ message reached the party headquarters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Weil , SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands out after the over@@ coming of the green de@@ pu@@ ties El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests for the CDU without their own government majority .
it is the provisional highlight of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD state associations .
and nobody knows what comes next .
the failure began with the un@@ exp@@ ir@@ atory defeat in the Saarland election in March .
a blue eye , no more , the comra@@ des so@@ aked at his time .
according to the state elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different .
it was then - and all this was much worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into exchange , the Düsseldorf @-@ Ple@@ ite hau@@ te the party smooth .
in the weeks the comra@@ des re@@ signed in the weeks afterwards .
then , when they had exhausted just new courage , the G @-@ 20 Summit of Hamburg came .
and with him the next r@@ ash came .
mayor O@@ laf Sch@@ olz , the last powerful SPD state , lost his Nim@@ bus that weekend , because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie , while his city was burning .
and because in crisis communication he was so pretty wrong , what can be done wrong .
since then , Sch@@ olz is fighting for his political survival .
now also Stephan Weil .
because of the VW @-@ exhaust and his role in the Supervisory Board , the Lower Sax@@ on Prime Minister has already been in criticism for a long time .
mi@@ ese revers@@ als came on .
nevertheless , or maybe because , because in the past few weeks , because in the past few weeks , he tried to make acc@@ ents in the covenant .
the ende@@ avor of the former mayor of Hannover to expand its power in Berlin was also not hidden by Martin Schulz &apos;s environment .
they let him grant him , because it was a stabili@@ zation of the party .
now the exact opposite could occur .
in doing so , Weil passed on to the part@@ isan region , in fact , there is no gu@@ ilt in the country .
and Schulz is not at all .
the comra@@ de therefore ende@@ av@@ ours to keep their own ranks closed .
her anger is jud@@ ging to the Gre@@ ens , and above all in the ab@@ tr@@ al parliamentary elections in T@@ v@@ ests .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and Democrats &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how Mrs. T@@ v@@ ests presents their own career food on the interests of all the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , chief of the par@@ atro@@ cities in the SPD parliamentary demand , the Federal Ministry of Technology ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ms. T@@ v@@ ests is not elected because of her person as direct can@@ di@@ dat@@ in , but on the country list of the Lower Sax@@ on Green Party , so the Dutch @-@ Sax@@ on MPs continue .
the logical consequence would be that it returns their mandate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , chief of the SPD Bundestag , compl@@ ains an &quot; un@@ democratic maneu@@ ver . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the voters aged four years ago was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people have made Stephan Weil to the Prime Minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the lower Sax@@ on candidate to the German elections , the R@@ ND . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; now , the personal career thinking of a future CDU / de@@ pu@@ ties the voting result , &quot; Op@@ per@@ mann said further .
he urged to clari@@ fy the back@@ grounds .
I want to know if there &apos;s more or more additional by the CDU Nieders@@ achsen .
funding of Ort@@ is@@ ers III
who wants to be renovated in the years , can get support from the country soon .
in this inform@@ al Mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representatives of Ste@@ g Urban Development on Wednesday in sens@@ ations .
at the beginning of the information session , Sch@@ ind@@ ler announced a review of the events previously .
since 1991 , I admit it in sens@@ ations of san@@ itation .
at that time , in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the country Baden @-@ Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding amount .
in the rehabilitation area II from 2005 to 2016 , the surplus was still 60 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , the current renov@@ ations are a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; successful project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - it is finally important to promote the inner development , not only new building areas . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on April 4 , I received the information from the Regierung@@ sprä@@ si@@ dium Karlsruhe that it will be a san@@ itation III .
the total amount paid 8@@ 33 333 Euros , of which 500 000 Euro would come from the country , the rest of the church sens@@ ations .
how is a rehabilitation area created ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; one will continue to investig@@ ate so Sch@@ ind@@ ler , where the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; real old &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; houses are . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it also plays a role , whether in the planned field , interest is to be rehabil@@ itated .
if necessary , the boundaries could shift again again .
the jet@@ ty was on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
cell@@ ars presented the contents of the federal government &quot; Social City , &quot; in which the renov@@ ations would then be performed .
core of the program include the Rev@@ it@@ alization of Inn@@ tal cities , improving residential and employment and ob@@ taining infrastructure .
the measures would be objective , which is called per property .
the rehabilitation area would eventually be established as a stat@@ ute .
the funding period for the funding period exp@@ ires since January 1 , 2017 until 30 April 20@@ 26 .
however until September this year , however , only the stock exchange would be carried out , as part of those who are involved in the rehabilitation area .
in November or December , the amend@@ ment must be made in order to begin with the renov@@ ations next year .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann stated that each Commun@@ e must carry out the pursu@@ ing procedure .
it is about to rate and decide the urban dis@@ bur@@ ies , and to decide when san@@ ction is and in what extent .
it will also be entered in the book for the respective grounds .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come again to a sensation and make a picture of the situation , she promised .
Got@@ zel stressed , an essential success factor for the project is the participation of the involved parties .
this is why there will be quest@@ ionn@@ aires who will be sent out in the coming weeks and be completed by the end of the summer holidays .
&quot; &quot; &quot; yellow quest@@ ionnaire is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; building and boundary sheet , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it comes to the structural condition and the rehabilitation views . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the grey quest@@ ionnaire , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; household and housing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; data can be made in size , split and residents of a living room . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; run@@ way &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is only to be filled if they are operated in the building . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Got@@ zel proved that a fulfilled quest@@ ionnaire is not a application for funding at the same time .
new construction measures are not eligible .
Sch@@ ind@@ ler emphas@@ ized that the distribution of convey@@ ing agents according to the &quot; Wind@@ ho@@ e principle &quot; is functional - who comes first , ste@@ als first .
no sponsors could be booked for later . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; finally photos of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ort@@ sk@@ ern II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were shown to make a renovation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pal@@ atable &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
British inventor puts itself a micro@@ chip to come with a hand movement in house and car
a British inventor is the first in the country , which is equipped with a micro@@ chip , so that he can open his door@@ step , enter its office and even start his car with a hand@@ movement .
Steven Nor@@ th@@ am , 33 , had the tiny chip between thum@@ bs and poin@@ ter and now offers the service for businesses and individuals who want to simpli@@ fy their lives with technology by its company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he graduated with Dr. Ge@@ off Watson , a consultant an@@ aes@@ thes@@ ist at the Royal H@@ amp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant@@ ation process is carried out after medical standard .
the technology re@@ sembles a micro @-@ chip cats and it takes only 30 seconds .
the company of Mr Nor@@ th@@ am also wants to change the locks on houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , everything for a surcharge of £ 300 per lock .
the married father of one has now built both at home and with his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the wheel .
the advertising costs of the White House cost the tax@@ pay@@ er thousands
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House &apos;s decision to fly a navy helicopter to the South La@@ wn in the last month , tax@@ pay@@ ers cost tax@@ pay@@ ers to the TIM@@ E magazine which gave the TIM@@ E magazine for up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the green white S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One when the President is on board , at the heart of the event on July 17th , at the White House with American Building Programs .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and Chief officials of the White House made a tour of all 50 states .
this helicopter was made in Connec@@ tic@@ ut next to a yacht from Maine , a fire@@ man car from Wisconsin and a forkli@@ ft of Mississippi .
the military office of the White House demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or quest@@ rian , barely 36 hours before the helicop@@ ters landed on the South La@@ wn , following the records of the Navy Hel@@ icop@@ ter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 ) , the unit which is responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; I only wanted to realize you are aware of it because it is such an unusual event of high visibility , &quot; the commander of the H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 wrote on the eve of the event of its su@@ peri@@ ors , the deputy nav@@ al man@@ de@@ ur for aviation .
the message showed that the helicopter arrived at the South La@@ wn in the morning at 7 o &apos; clock in the morning , and so long stayed , until the grass had been vac@@ ated between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on this evening .
the note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed , a second team would be needed for flight return due to the limitation of the service hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the original airline &apos;s crew was during the helicopter during the security personnel during the time on the ground in the plane . &quot; &quot; &quot;
out of the TIM@@ E provided , the recordings were not clear whether a second flight crew was necessary .
the Hatch Act forbi@@ ds to use federal law , state property for political purposes .
records indicate that H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 asked if the event could harm the destination .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a question that we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch acts and we were informed that this was not the case &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the commander wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; sounds as if you are locked , &quot; the deputy commander answered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the event &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also official events have political tones .
at the event , the President gave a violation of the reform of health reform that was underway in the Senate , and he prop@@ ag@@ ated efforts to con@@ strain the government regulations .
the use of the aircraft that is known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phenomenon from politically beneficial purposes .
presi@@ dents are obliged to use them for the trip .
but their use only for a photo @-@ operation is un@@ common .
Tr@@ ump carried out a test in February when the presidential airplane service in the background of his first Kamp@@ ag@@ nen@@ r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages that compl@@ ained about the use of the Presi@@ dency by its predecessor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House is impressed by the show &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made In America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the products from all 50 states are produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the vice @-@ president of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 occup@@ ations often lead training flights in the area around Washington and in the South La@@ wn in order to susp@@ end the US president in the White House with precision cen@@ timet@@ res .
when Tr@@ ump was at the G20 summit in early July at the G20 summit in Germany , H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 led to 58 exercises in the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event counted among the training needs of the flight crew for the month , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said an official . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hel@@ ik@@ op@@ ter units flew additionally 11 hours to this day for &quot; non @-@ presidential support . &quot;
the White House said that the tax@@ pay@@ ers did not have the burden of any of the other pro@@ ps that were presented at the event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company was not involved to exhibit the helicopter on the South La@@ wn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 does not maintain any budget drawings for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to the State Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D deliver@@ er for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per hour of flight .
recordings of the unit record the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility &apos;s home base in Qu@@ an@@ tico .
the White House argu@@ ed that the actual costs for the operation of the helicopter lie far under this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax pay@@ ers on the basis of valu@@ ing estimates is most mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs which are included in the annual means . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a R@@ AND study from 2015 , the amount of personnel costs for Do@@ D does not include personnel costs , but consider the cost of fuel , maintenance and contract statements .
at that time , the former spokes@@ man of the White House , Sean Sp@@ are , defended the operation of the helicopter for the event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea is to present things this week , which are produced in America , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sp@@ ark . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I know that S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and the state of Connec@@ tic@@ ut are very proud to contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds if not even thousands of people depend on it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think like most Americans , we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked rel@@ ent@@ lessly .
of course , it is reasonable to highlight . &quot;
it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump inter@@ acts with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire@@ man .
in the White House , Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and talked about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky very well , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss in front of tri@@ cky task
top runner of the Second Tennis @-@ Bundesliga occurs in the table of Su@@ pper S@@ V .
TC blue @-@ Weiss Ne@@ uss will start tomorrow at 11 o &apos;clock in Kiel during the tab@@ ular Su@@ pper S@@ V .
despite five games still mak@@ er@@ os@@ er balance , the leader of the Second Tennis @-@ Bundesliga was the sense of reality .
team chief Mar@@ ius Z@@ ay has any respect for opponents before the opponent .
&quot; this is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation .
just on the back positions I find the crew very well . &quot;
for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer S@@ V , mainly imports from the high North .
&quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even refer to applications in the Davis Cup .
and they are also strong in doubles , &quot; says Z@@ ay with a view to Har@@ ri Hel@@ i@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andre Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas Bj@@ ar@@ hus ( all Denmark ) .
&quot; it &apos;s always difficult for us . &quot;
there you need good luck . &quot;
the Ne@@ uss@@ er team for the trip to the high North stands practically .
his debut for blue @-@ white could give maximum jan@@ ju@@ ly .
at the moment the Ch@@ allen@@ ger tournament in the Italian bi@@ ella active Fren@@ chman did not come to the Bundesliga game , the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) will be competing in this season at the tournament in the Czech Li@@ bere@@ c ( Czech Republic ) .
the previously un@@ defeated Chil@@ ean Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik @-@ Castillo was yesterday with the Weiß@@ r@@ ussen An@@ drei Vas@@ il@@ ev@@ ski still at the ATP tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el on the ball .
but he should be in Kiel as well as Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ schul@@ p , Niel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and the Belgian Julien C@@ agn@@ ina .
after his two victories last Sunday at the Al@@ ster , Má@@ té Val@@ kus@@ z could again bring back to the team .
enough for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hungary , who was still the number one of the Junior World Championships in January 2016 , does not fill with someone from the train@@ ee around Mar@@ ius Z@@ ay the Ka@@ der .
how America can harm the O@@ MV
indeed , Donald Tr@@ ump did not work when he put on Wednesday evening his signature under the law for the van@@ guard of sanctions against Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his H@@ ast , the law en@@ acted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Con@@ gres@@ sed the Congress a few &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ constitutional provisions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he was et@@ ched . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels sh@@ amed against the US advance .
after all , the draft is to pun@@ ish European companies that help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pel@@ ines into the EU .
since then , investors of the local O@@ MV , who together with other European companies co @-@ funded the construction of the Russian Baltic States Nord Stream 2 .
the thr@@ ott@@ le is huge .
however , it is too early for an estimate of the consequences , as the official statement of the oil company .
in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump would have to raise the sanctions even by Executive Order to life .
he is a choice of twelve weapons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has viewed which the Group could refuse , and which could really hurt him . &quot; &quot; &quot;

A@@ way back : the city depic@@ ts 46 ch@@ ai@@ ds
the city re @-@ organis@@ es the K@@ ita @-@ lunch table itself .
with fixed contact partners for the children and a assignment for the team .
in the urban day@@ care centres the clock is turned back .
on September 1st the city of Kre@@ feld will take over the food supply to the urban day@@ care centres ( Kit@@ as ) again in Fe@@ atu@@ ie .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , deputy head in the youth care department , this is good news : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are all very pleased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the house is still cooked : a co@@ ater takes over this task and delivers fresh cooked co@@ ols .
the city operates in the area of 46 day@@ care centres , in 44 the children have got a hot meal at lunch@@ time .
in the last kit@@ a@@ year 2800 children were sitting at the tables , and the need is growing steadily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , not only children who are about 45 week@@ days are served in the K@@ ita &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer also applies in the 35 @-@ hour supervision , if children until 14 am . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 Participation teachers from 1st September kitchen staff : they warm up the delivered dishes , they supplement for let@@ tu@@ ce , raw foods and fruit , por@@ tion@@ ate the meal individually , give food out , rinse and clean the kitchen .
&quot; the workers are firmly assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
the size - there are two groups as well as seventh tro@@ op facilities - decide on the timetable .
&quot; the kitchen assist@@ ants now belong to the K@@ ita team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it is much stronger and it is easier to implement educational concepts for the kit@@ ties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this is why it is possible : healthy food and cooking lessons .
&quot; children should help to prepare food . &quot;
the direct connection of the Kü@@ ch@@ enk@@ end@@ ans Team is useful .
even for the children .
&quot; they have a well @-@ known power in the K@@ ita , a person who is familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot;
this continu@@ ity is important for the children .
the pur@@ ge of the K@@ ita rooms - so far the task of the kitchen staff - will be done by special cleaning agents in the future .
this version - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - in addition to the quality improvement of the kitchen performance also has the charm , which it has turned out to the city as the most economical solution , called it from the press department .
and this , although 46 particip@@ ators are re @-@ adjusted .
&quot; but these hours are not so strong at around 750 people in the attraction , &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN
elections can only be representative if all members of the company , including women , play a role , said the chief of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
Nicholas Hay@@ som , official head of the United Nations Mission , said that hundreds of women are can@@ di@@ aries in the provinces . three women tend to be vice @-@ president for the role of vice @-@ president and over 30 percent of new registered voters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elections can only be a representative and credi@@ ble , if women are un@@ restricted and included in all parts of the choice process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afghan elections for the Provin@@ cial Council and the presidential elections take place on 5 April .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Taliban issued threats against a choice process that collapse with the transition from international combat operations to an advis@@ ory role . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this year elections for the first time will be peaceful from a demo@@ cr@@ atically elected government to the next .
Hay@@ som said , a strong role for women will boost the democratic success in Afghanistan .
the Afghan independent election Commission reported that 1.2 million women were registered by registered 3.6 million voters .

at the management of the Bis@@ ku@@ it manufacturer Mc@@ Vit@@ ie , a union company wants to make a long @-@ term commitment to production at the Glasgow plant in Glasgow .
G@@ MB Scotland said that the company were silent about the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross site .
more than 500 employees work in the work which manufactures in addition to other products Hob@@ no@@ bs and Rich Tea biscuits .
Mc@@ V@@ ities owner Pla@@ dis said that he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that employees and union representatives &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would like to learn when their activities would change . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the company of the company called G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vit@@ ie &apos;s on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Conc@@ erns on external concerns &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that the financing for the modernis@@ ation of production lines is not driven forward . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ MB Senior Organ@@ iser Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that we cannot win clarity of the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross , concerns our members deeply . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; generations of families have been working here and labour forces focus on the local community and the large space Glasgow , an important pillar for decent jobs in a region with high unemployment and social dis@@ advant@@ aged . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wage and prosperity , and in front of the Bre@@ xit , the increasing cost of life and the chronic production process , the eastern end of Glasgow urgently need a th@@ ri@@ ving presence in Mc@@ Vit@@ ie . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; said S &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Fili@@ p@@ ite &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Fili@@ p@@ ite at T@@ oll@@ cross had just received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland ( and the company will react directly to the company &apos;s continued commitment in employees and trade union representatives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two months ago , we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representative at T@@ oll@@ cross where some questions were openly discussed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we discussed with the staff that we operate as all companies engaged in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , all our business areas and locations - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she added : &quot; in recent years , we invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross site , especially in production lines and operative improvements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we recognize the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production site and completely . should our work processes change at the location , the staff and their union representatives will be the first to learn this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona warned three years ago ?
the site of La League likes her interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Germain will not release in its persecution of Ne@@ ym@@ ar , after having invaded an offer of £ 189 million , in order to trigger his open @-@ air clau@@ se , but did they warned Barcelona three years before the world record ?
the sens@@ ational approach has he@@ ats the Trans@@ fer@@ ment window in the summer , as the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand , whereby Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United last season for 89 million pounds .
after the completion , Ne@@ ym@@ ar will become the most expensive player in the world , and the highest @-@ paid professional sport@@ s@@ men in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is angry about the way , how Ne@@ ym@@ ar has forced its way out outside , although a source in the proximity of the Catal@@ ans board is that the club has always given its best to take care of it since his arrival from Santos in 2013 to take care of him .
but the football world was warned by the PS@@ G President three years ago ?
when Manchester City 2014 was interested in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for every club to sign up one of the top players of PS@@ G .
&quot; I &apos;m not worried because they know if they touch one of our players , then we will contact them in opposition , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi .
&quot; we respect all clubs .
but if they try to sign a one of our players , then this will have consequences . &quot;
Barcelona seems to have exceeded this line , the Spanish association expressed its interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer .
PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow it to travel to the International from Italy , and Barcelona could sense the consequences of this interest by losing one of their price offers for Ne@@ ym@@ ar .
sco@@ oter and damaged
during the night of Friday on Saturday , a well @-@ known perpet@@ rators is inten@@ tionally thrown at the Königs@@ felder street in front of the estate number 30 , and so on the fair@@ ing of the vehicle Sach@@ harm of more than 200 euros .
the Police Sch@@ ram@@ berg , Tel@@ ephone 07@@ 422 / 27 01 @-@ 0 , asks for critics .
due to an accident on the B 215 between Stol@@ zen@@ au and Le@@ ese the police are looking for witnesses .
because a car met him on his lane , the driver had to ev@@ ade a VW Tour@@ an and touch@@ eth the lad@@ ders .
on Thursday evening the 34 @-@ year @-@ old was coming from Reh@@ burg @-@ Lo@@ cc@@ um with his VW at 19.@@ 55 on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au in the direction of Le@@ ese .
in the area of the outskirts of Stol@@ zen@@ au there was a passenger car on his lane , so that he needed to turn right .
the Tour@@ an driver touch@@ eth the guides .
in passenger car , atomic damage was created .
the driver of the opposite car , a Mercedes Benz , had over@@ hau@@ led a truck and continued its journey without taking care of the traffic accident .
according to the accident , it can be good that the Mer@@ c@@ ed@@ es@@ man hadn &apos;t noticed the accident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police now asks witnesses of the incident and the driver of the caus@@ al experience , under Tel . 05@@ 7@@ 61 / 9@@ 20@@ 60 with the Commissioner in Stol@@ zen@@ au . &quot; &quot; &quot;
interview : &quot; Dom@@ en@@ ching @-@ Report reli@@ eves Pope @-@ Brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
Pope John @-@ Brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger transferred the down@@ fall in the Dom@@ spar@@ row report to the abuse of abuse .
this means author and historian Michael H@@ es@@ emann .
the final report for the Miss@@ ing sc@@ andal at the Dom@@ pointed Spar@@ rows takes care of discussions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Christian Weis@@ nder , spokes@@ man of the reform movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We are Church , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared to publication against the German Press Agency , and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as by the cathedral master Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the emer@@ itus Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , an excuse . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church , when Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deepest regret on their own in@@ let or at the back the wrong assessment of processes would be expressed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Vatican Council &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; however , critic@@ ized that at the coverage of violence at the Dom@@ en@@ atzen with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two measure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was measured . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no one regard to the attacks in Regensburg , no one doubt that it should be punished by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sh@@ ame@@ ful and sh@@ ame@@ ful deeds &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the national Italian Bio@@ eth@@ ics Committee . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hab@@ it to design@@ ate the Catholic Church as a source of all evil , is already part of the everyday experience and prepar@@ es public opinion that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the princip@@ ality of Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Taxis said in an interview with the Bavarian Radio : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you &apos;re looking forward to the church and it &apos;s a folded fres@@ co . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , she pointed out that in her youth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Make a completely normal ped@@ agog@@ ical means &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; to be done with nau@@ gh@@ ty children , as I was one to become ready . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they find it un@@ fair , today &apos;s standards for past decades , because the world has changed .
in connection with the reports on the abuse of abuse , Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also appeared .
&quot; &quot; &quot; completely wrong , author and historian Michael H@@ es@@ emann , who was translated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My Brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; written in 12 languages . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says H@@ es@@ emann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report which was presented by the honorary citizen Ulrich Weber by the Refle@@ c@@ ist@@ oc@@ ese of Regensburg ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; a total of 5@@ 47 rainf@@ all spar@@ rows were ab@@ used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with high pl@@ aid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; victims of attacks , 67 Dom@@ spar@@ rows sexually ab@@ used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the final report about Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so sum@@ ming up that Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister has been applied in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially with high levels of Emot@@ ions , the punishment for the students could be more fer@@ oci@@ ous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but in contrast to numerous other accus@@ ations , many victims were rated by R. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General Human@@ ity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and therefore in numerous cases , despite violence , lack some positive memories with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the interview , H@@ es@@ emann explains why the final report for the abuse sc@@ andal at the rainy season Georg R@@ atz@@ inger took his opinion .
Mr. H@@ es@@ emann , the 440 pages report on the &quot; inci@@ dents of violence exerc@@ ised in the &quot; Incidents of violence , &quot; is a contradic@@ tory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a lift , many students emphas@@ ize his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the other , it also appears as a chol@@ eri@@ ker and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , that has become more musical than top performance in the eye .
how do you describe this final report as his bi@@ ographer ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : when you &apos;re reading the effort and reads the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is in it .
just eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly acquitted of every suspicion of the Mitt@@ ens or co @-@ death in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the Ge@@ wal@@ io processes also occ@@ ured at the school , outside of its sphere of action .
you can imagine it in case , out of it too late , or first impression not taken seriously enough .
the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ ate , on which he worked , was perceived by virtually all respon@@ dents - as literally &quot; redemption , &quot; &quot; Heaven &quot; and &quot; Better World . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the vast majority of his student Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also provides an excellent testimony , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competent , and &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the boys regularly supplied with cakes , cookies and cand@@ y and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; always surrounded by grapes of children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a minority sur@@ compl@@ ained about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and his tremendous Emot@@ ions , which led to W@@ ut@@ aus@@ arri@@ es as well .
he did not only threw those with chairs and threw the key@@ ring on the ground , but also earrings out and very nau@@ gh@@ ty guys from the hair or ears , he has already regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for it .
however , to be honest , however , such education methods in the question@@ able time , the 1960s and 1970s , were widely used in parents like teachers .
do you also know such re@@ bre@@ eder methods ?
of course , I think each one of us was born before 1968 .
I have also experienced this in a sec@@ ular school , a state gymn@@ asium .
compared to what , in fact , in this report , namely , sexual abuse and climate processes at the pre@@ school , are certainly excav@@ at@@ ellen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then you wonder if it was not more likely to do with his fame and his role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , a lot of media has just thrown upon him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Bavarian Pope , many people who never understood him are still e@@ ager .
but the truth is : the report reli@@ eves Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the media , in connection with the report was reported a lot about the topic of abuse during the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rainy Cathedral &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the final report also some processing or complic@@ ity in relation to sexual abuse ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : clearly no .
no one of the 67 victims of sexual ass@@ aults claims to have entru@@ sted to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were consecr@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never dar@@ ed to speak with my father or my mother , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one covered signs for the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was all very embar@@ r@@ assing for me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real problem in the recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance of sexual abuse has been , however , that most victims are silent .
if they trusted not even parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , he would certainly not have a ch@@ oral director , who would have been a colleague of the perpet@@ rators .
how do the German spar@@ rows student R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in relation to abuse fail@@ ures ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : a question@@ ed student form@@ ulated this way : &quot; in regard to sexual abuse ... I don &apos;t see any case in which he could have had been reviewed ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) and would have been able to stop the respective perpet@@ rators .
I think it ... also for really absurd to assume that it was charged ... Bu@@ ben in@@ tru@@ sive or clear@@ er or even more likely to have opened compared to their parents , inter@@ nat@@ s@@ conduc@@ tors , confi@@ denti@@ als , etc .
that one speaks with him about sex ... - un@@ th@@ ink@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so the report on the very clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that in advance , the pupils and / or their environment entru@@ sted him , could not be confirmed in the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as for sexual abuse , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is therefore free of engagement from everyone .
this way , it can not be thrown out , not prevented or brought him to the ad .
therefore , there is no reason to bring up his good name with these contradic@@ tions , as unfortunately in some cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the media was much of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ wal@@ tex@@ z@@ essen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the rainy season of Dom@@ en@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the previous domain master Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thrown into the report &quot; Weg@@ ner . &quot;
do he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : that &apos;s the great problem that in the reporting everything was mixed and mixed up to a giant mel@@ ange from sexual abuse and Ge@@ wal@@ tex@@ z@@ essen and somewhere , in the middle of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but this is just a mis@@ use of the Ber@@ ich@@ tes .
it is clean up separately : between the pre@@ school and the secondary school of the Dom@@ en@@ ching , between sexual abuse and Ge@@ wal@@ tex@@ z@@ essen , we say once , other accus@@ ations .
the report also treated inci@@ dents in the period since 1945 , thus also from four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was no ch@@ oral director of the Dom@@ spar@@ rows .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entire terrible test educ@@ ators , the cases in which boys were viol@@ ated and nar@@ row@@ ly suffered from sa@@ dist@@ ic teachers , all at the pre@@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ hofen where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions have to prevail . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but with those , dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he got the boys first to face when she had already been on the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asium .
on that way , like most witnesses , the theme &quot; Pre@@ school &quot; tab@@ u .
it was only happy to be her escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; heavenly &quot; conditions .
what was different at the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asium ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : indeed there was discipline , but not sa@@ dist@@ ic violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report is coming to the conclusion that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many victims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have been rated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the general humanity by R. &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; in numerous cases , despite violence , even positive memories with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , at the most , it remains the reproach to have looked off .
but , despite all efforts , the report could only define two time periods in which the states were reported at the school .
the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish itself and from the events at a school where he was not working and responsible ( so the witness ) wanted nothing to hear , and then again around 1993 .
sent Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in front of the states consistently the ears ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : no , because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the cathedral secondary school in which the report was even re@@ produced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in it he pointed out that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tests will continue to be practiced in the pre@@ school . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already in view of the danger of negative media , he recommended urgent powers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was , of course , at a time when legal clarity was also banned in Bavaria .
before that they appear in a legal grey zone , as everyone knows of us .
it was hard to estimate for him , where people perhaps ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated or dram@@ ati@@ zed , and where really the permitted limit was exceeded .
you can &apos;t say either , he always looked out .
that just doesn &apos;t right .
only in 1980 the test penalty of schools was officially abolished in Bavaria .
princip@@ ality Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Taxis said it was un@@ fair to apply the educational standards for the time of today .
how do you see that ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are talking about the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sn@@ are of An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; i.e. the danger , past to today &apos;s moral standards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the princess has quite right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but this is not true for sexual abuse , which was ab@@ omin@@ able to all times , and not for what was broken up in the pre@@ school of rebel@@ li@@ ation and violence at innocent children &apos;s sake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is all very terrible and I &apos;m glad that it &apos;s finally getting up .
but at the same time I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , for all this had nothing to do with him .
his means to be discipl@@ ined and punishment , so ear@@ ear and ears to the hair and ears were widespread in the 1970s .
when physical punishment was forbidden then , he has also kept himself in mind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what picture of his rainy season , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger has played in talks with you for the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
did the subject responded to the language ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI said about his perspective , so the cathedral spar@@ rows only played a part .
nevertheless , I did not fail at all that he led a thorough regim@@ ent there .
but that has to be said once : without these perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without having un@@ conditional discipline , it would hardly be possible from the until then rather nation@@ ally known Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ spar@@ rows an institution of space , true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition that went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with cookies and cand@@ y alone , you don &apos;t have any big singers and in front of any success , at which area , yet discipline , passion and self @-@ insur@@ moun@@ table .
what kind of people did you experience Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in talks about her book ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : through the work on the book and in addition , I met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger really well and again and again as a wonderful , hum@@ orous , hom@@ este@@ emed , deep belie@@ ver and warm people , of which you can &apos;t imagine that he could do something in a fly .
I get regular contact with how many former Dom@@ sp@@ atzen still today , 23 years after his Emer@@ gency , visit him to read him - he is almost blind - and to treat him as a member of her family .
those who do not forgive him till today , that he once was strictly speaking to them , are clearly in the minority .
most of these spar@@ rows are grateful to him today , that he en@@ riches their lives and brought to them the world of music .
and that he always was a good , pat@@ ern@@ al teacher - a strict father , certainly it may be - but also a lo@@ vable respec@@ tful person , to which they still look up and hon@@ our@@ ing them .
and please , even more clearly : all that you give him are gu@@ ardi@@ ans that were on the agenda at that time .
we can be glad we have overcome this time long ago .
but it is highly un@@ just , a man , just because he is promin@@ ently and a more prominent brother to make the media sin @-@ goat .
there is the evil int@@ ent which is behind it , only too obvious .
for the report which has just been published , reli@@ eved him .
now the stop @-@ up areas , a 93 @-@ year old man who bought great mer@@ its and without the outside of Bavaria , and perhaps Germany would probably know the rain@@ s@@ burger Cathedral spar@@ rows was finally to be in peace .
