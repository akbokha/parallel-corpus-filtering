<seg id="2">A Irren-Anstalt, where young people are going to meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A tomb stone where is excavated for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">The peassugardener manage the former reasons for peasants.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich encourages exciting stories about days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It nervousness, when maps are not currently current.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everybody knows who had already been exciting because the car Navi took place instead of a crossing road on a green meadow.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bayern-Atlases, an offer of the Geoport Bayern of the State Government, are all other than current - but therefore very conclusive.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially when you compare it with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "then it is clear how cities and communities have changed in the spread-area of the Munich Merkur since the 19th century." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern atlas is a splits, that one does not recognize the same as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">For cities and municipalities of more detailed maps, so-called urine leaves were incorporated.</seg>
<seg id="13">These were created according to the Bavarian surveyor settlement between 1810 and 1864, and skip the first surveyance of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army occupied Bavaria since spring 1800 during the Second coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon took an overview of the occupied country and gave topographic survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Finally, when French troops returned to the peace of Lunéville of February 9, 1801: it was today's neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bayern Map.</seg>
<seg id="18">Kurfürst Max IV Joseph progressed the project, founded the "Topographic Bureau," and therefore the Bayerische Vermessaging.</seg>
<seg id="19">The document sheet for Munich is from the year 1856 and is available as any other on the Bavarian State Library's website.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison early / today is the most pressing of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The town has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">One example of this is subsendling, which is relatively isolated in the map from 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was established 21 years after the creation of the map, so in 1877, as a Munich district.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, Untersendling lies in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses of the houses were concentrating in 1856 along the today's Plinganserstraße which was named after George Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where the Westpark is, one sees nothing as fields - at first glance: a smaller card with dozens of lines and numbers: handwritten numbered pieces from the so-called "primal" which was derived from the basic tax.</seg>
<seg id="27">Little parcels there are no farmers no more - but smoulders of the plant "land in sun."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is signalled north of the subsendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Theresienwiese, since 1810 of the Oktoberfests, was actually still a meadow - and no concrete desert.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "in the Urpositional flyer, one reads only the road name" "" "on the guest dough" "" "or from the hill" "" "on the air" "" "- but also in large letters" "" "Irren Anstalt" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here on the Auerfeldstraße one once locked people with madness.</seg>
<seg id="33">There was in 1858 / 59 the Munich Circle of Irrenese "At the Auer Lünen."</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872 Dr. Bernhard von Gudder directed the institution - the psychiatrist, who is brought to the death of King Ludwig II in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "he was progressive for his time and ended for example the chains of the so-called Irren." ""</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "in addition, he prohibited the staff to apply violence against the occupants," "" "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of Haidhausen, who has worked for an exhibition with Anstalt." ""</seg>
<seg id="37">There was a place for 280 patients, later was expanded to 500 seats.</seg>
<seg id="38">Eventually this capacity was not enough - the reason for the construction of the roundabout in hair 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Isar-AMPER-Klinikum Munich-Ost is one of Germany's largest psychiatrists since 2006.</seg>
<seg id="40">The territory of the former Auer Anstalt, young people meet in the Munich Salesianum.</seg>
<seg id="41">The order acquired the building complex in 1920 and walked in a youth home with training.</seg>
<seg id="42">West is the TSV Munich east entrance, east of the houses dating from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" built an architectural style on the origin of origin of the Irrenanstalt, which was destroyed during the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="44">The Marienplatz was listed in 1856 as "main square," the department store was called "Kaufinger Gasse."</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">In December 1944 the Allies were cut many holes to downtown in December 1944.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big one stayed until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English institute, small business buildings and a Gruftkapelle from the Middle Ages were once again at the Marienhof, where this time the preliminary work will take place on 5 April 2017 at the groundbreaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn course.</seg>
<seg id="49">The old Munich-card can be compared with the aerial photo of today - and fill the hole on the Marienhof.</seg>

<seg id="77">"here we have to fight with the conditions and the topography," said Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003 he took over the elternal operation and managed this without chemical plant protection and fertilizers, even if he does not conduct bio-operation.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "for mayor Thomas Schneider was clear:" "" "the Commune recognized the importance of the electric fence and is glad about the leader promoting." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">The farmers would have to be supported at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare.</seg>
<seg id="81">We hope that the afforestation of the surfaces could still be drawn up for a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the greatest treasure we have, are the people who work in agriculture and make thoughts about how they continue their operation," "" "stressed the Mayor." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">The farmers are often in criticism of criticism</seg>
<seg id="84">A total of 25 plots were fenced in the year 2013 on the electric fence.</seg>
<seg id="85">The disclosure area is thus 40 hectares, which must not be attened at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">Half of the leader was funded by the total costs of 71 500 euros, a quarter carried by the community of Fischerbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Consequently, the farmers remained 12 610 Euro, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of electric fence.</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of fences," said Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="89">Kordula Kovac stressed: "you are doing a really good job without farmers and farmers do not go."</seg>

<seg id="96">The disclosure area corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 Euro.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing sacred anymore?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump is taking the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is it when they begin to attack statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans like to appreciate such as every other - hence the sort of staged overthrow Saddam Hussein's place at the Firdos square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a hot fight with Jim Acosta by CNN about the proposals of the President to the drastic restriction of the legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To stay fair, Miller did not handle the statue.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boatisers and Liberty Imiters would have suffered him, if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he took their significance, and in particular the meaning that it was written, as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the Monument, has been added to his base.</seg>
<seg id="105">As Miller Acosta described, "I don't want to go into a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom which lightens the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem, which you refer to, was added later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is proper properly, but as he formulated it, it's not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "it's about contemporary resonance on the rebellious words of Lazarus, the only one in which a state does not only invites any old immigrants." "" "your poor, your poor, / your fiery masses, who yearns to breathe freely, / plowing waste of your rich coasts." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="109">"" "there was never a time to see better in the" "" "soothing waste" "" "on our screens." ""</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he did not make sure these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural conflict: in fact, a conflict about the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who advised him to place their words after her death at the base - were very good that they had a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American republicanism by portraying the feminine embodiment of freedom in an unused classic portrayal of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in their poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And they themselves have another name: mother of exilant.</seg>
<seg id="116">The combination of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, people wanted to change it from right wing.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great cry of Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is nobody, but rather an early Neocondoms which brings the American flame into the surrounding world: "Lady Liberty is going forward.</seg>
<seg id="119">It should bear torches of freedom from the United States in the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch should not lighten the way into the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">Rather unusual, Limbaugh came down here.</seg>
<seg id="122">"" "" "" "the importance of the statue is wholly and even a question of the standpoint of perception." ""</seg>
<seg id="123">Indeed, the great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see them as they were of the exhaustive, but hopeful people after long and often terrible travel on the decks of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is about the truest sense to see the world from a perspective of people who seek refuge and improve a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">"" "her statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome you have to hear." ""</seg>
<seg id="126">And of course this is not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever want to recognize.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch shall not shine through the way, but hatred, who is the only source of power, ignite.</seg>

<seg id="466">750 years of St. Hilarius Church: on the occasion of the jubilee of the Bergkirche the old cemetery-area in Tumble will be invited to a Serenade on Sunday, July 16th.</seg>
<seg id="467">Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village is the historic St. Hilarius station a popular place to stay.</seg>
<seg id="468">Visitors of the sixth Benefiz Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and conservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and sponsors for their concerns.</seg>
<seg id="470">Walter Martini stressed: "it is a unique dörgy gem."</seg>
<seg id="471">In 1267, the St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in the Württembürgisch documents. "count Hermann of Sulz sold" the mountain with the church of Eberhard by Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">According to the document, on the Tumlinger mountain, there was also a splendid courtyard, which belonged to the church or the patron saint, and not vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="473">So there lived people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">As from the description of the Upper Freudenstadt from 1858, it was beside the subvillage and the Upper Village that are still visible in the village of Tumble, the "Berg" of the third, the gorgeous settlers of the village.</seg>
<seg id="475">Ancient maps of time around 1600 are underpinned this historical conditions.</seg>
<seg id="476">The Patronate law emerged from the early medieval yenkirchen law.</seg>
<seg id="477">One Lord, built a church, arranged and occupied with a priest, stayed at the owner of this church, and he could also inherit these yenkirche church.</seg>
<seg id="478">This was right to place a priest, or to propose a priest to the bishop.</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The size of the two scattered at Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">The newly created bell rang the first time in 1692, but later had to be released in the Second World War in 1942.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the Thirty Years War (1616-1648), the windows were stolen and the bells were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was undense.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796 French troops encamped near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They broke out the pulpit and nakchairs and used them as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">The remains of the church threatened to fall in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869 the Tumlinger Hilarius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from the radio.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was extended and the Hilariuskirche was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the church tower was left standing.</seg>
<seg id="490">In the New Year's eight 1834 a storm caught the church tower and the half collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="491">To prevent disaster, the tower was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the high tower of the tower remained in today as a witness to the 750 year old church history.</seg>
<seg id="493">Today, Horst Kallenberg and Rolf-Dieter Wasem is the help of the "Schaffhausen pensioners" as successor of Dieter Dockhorn.</seg>

<seg id="1328">For this purpose she ordered the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home, not only a development, but also a place to live for Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms, so that the architectural challenge was to create an mezzanine in which you could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creative thinking about the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel works is quite complicated," he explains.</seg>

<seg id="1333">"" "it was not only about building a simple platform, but put the steel so that it had the right height for the function above or below." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1334">This order made it possible to place two rooms in full height - with lots of additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine, a classic copper window of Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of mirrors plays a part when adding theatre, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">At both ends a short corridor was mirrored to make it longer work.</seg>
<seg id="1339">The kitchen feels like a window in a different room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all the best and glasses of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">The beauty of a glamorous space can close the beauty of the living room when it is not used.</seg>

<seg id="1346">Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne could win an additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the land area - or as your property is appreciated," says Erfan.</seg>

<seg id="1407">POLITICO - very busy with this story - reported on the preference of advisers to doubtful information from strategic reasons in May.</seg>

<seg id="1411">Although Johnson has been banned from Twitter or that he did not offer any concrete evidence or that he expressed false accusations in the past and refuses them.</seg>

<seg id="1519">In the western arctic, a gigantic iceberg was solved by the barely seven-fold size of Berlin from Schelfeis.</seg>
<seg id="1520">This was shared by the Bremerhaven's Alfred-Wegener-Institute for Polar- and Marine Research on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="1521">The roughly one trillion tons heavy and 5800 square-kilometer large piston drive will drive back to the north and will probably need two, three years until it melted.</seg>
<seg id="1522">It operates at 175 kilometers of length and a width of up to 50 kilometers of one of the largest polar workers, researchers have registered in the past three decades.</seg>
<seg id="1523">There is no danger for people from him.</seg>
<seg id="1524">To what extent the climate change has played a role in the rump of the iceberg, is unclear according to research data.</seg>
<seg id="1525">However, since around 30 years, there have been a series of unusual collages of ice cream in the region, the US Research Center for snow and ice (NSIDC) writes in a faceted background.</seg>
<seg id="1526">According to many researchers, this can be related to global warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">The broken Koloss was a part of the Larsen-C-Schelfeis so far.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelfeis floats on the sea and is fed by great glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It continues to grow in the sea and breaks regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is located south of South America almost at the forefront of the antarctic peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">North of this classy was the balance of waxing and disrupting a few years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">A complete Schelfeis is disintegrated there, writes AWI-researcher Daniela Jansen.</seg>
<seg id="1533">There is some evidence that the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is in danger, because the front edge had never withdrawn himself as far as currently.</seg>
<seg id="1534">"" "" "" "in addition, the ice plate stand under voltage and can disintegrate if a piece is shot at a key point." ""</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of Schelfeis and Eisberg does not increase sea level, as they swim on the water and pushed ice as much water as it yields.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the shadow leads to the glaciers directly into the sea and can drain much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could possibly increase the sea level, but only in a low degree, the British research project becomes an observation of Antarctica (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is the fourth largest Schelfeis of the Antarctic according to AWI data with almost 50 000 square kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="1539">On the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the edge to the free ocean around 200 meters.</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"" "" "" "although it is a natural development and not a direct connection to climate change, the ice sign is now in a dangerous position," "" "said Martin O'Leary from the British Swansea University." ""</seg>
<seg id="1542">"this is the longest retreat since the beginning of records," he also confirmed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Among scientists was argued whether the Larsen-C-Schelfeis will grow back or long-term, his colleague Adrian Luckman and added: "our models say that it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will last decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even if this researcher did not lead the abortion of this gigantic iceberg on climate change, so many ice caps have been torn apart from the Antarctic Peninsula in recent decades.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long stretch of Antarctic stretches towards South America.</seg>

<seg id="1814">Safety experts have written three words on a table on the front of the room: opponent, Neutrale, allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They kindly ask the reporter to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary, perceptions and belly guilt.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of standing on the hearing list of government or cartels, a catalogue of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no rest of violence, and throughout the country the corpses were frequent, and more journalists came to office at least 25, ever since President Enrique Pena Nieto in December 2012 has stood his office. 589 have been standing by attacks and threats under federal protection and until now there was at least seven deaths in seven countries this year.</seg>

<seg id="1829">He managed to drive a few blocks away, before his red Toyota Corolla was arrested by two men. he was shot from his car and was shot in him for 12 times, presumably because of the name of the paper - which is translated with "twelve river."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The cap passed away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>

<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to walk around in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But the topic of Valdez is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzman's arrest in January and the extradition of the United States in January, Sinaloa became one of the most bloody battlefields of the country, since rivalling fractions are struggling here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa, someone or more people are shot on the road, or that the cemetery is full of intricted, two-story mausoleums for drug may be larger than many houses for the living.</seg>

<seg id="1838">Nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work is Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, with the blame for it that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">First of all, in February, the publication of a interview with Damo Lopez, a leader of one of the rival factions in the war with Guzmans sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication may have annoyed the sons, bound gangsters bought a copy of each copy as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kioske.</seg>

<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues could imitate that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003, when he joined forces with five colleagues at the establishment of Rioce and sold 50 US dollars in shareholdings.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"" "in Sinaloa," "" "it was impossible to operate journalism without having trouble the toxicant problem," "" "said Bojorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1847">At the time the newspaper had a reputation for discourageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising revenue.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporter loved to publish hard-like investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication where they could read stories that nobody had to handle anything else.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the founding of Rioce, she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot award" for their coverage in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee to protect journalists for his courage in pursuing Mexican drug history, wherever it lead.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave up voluntarily that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I want to continue to live," he said at the time of the CPJ award.</seg>
<seg id="1853">"" "drug trafficking in Sinaloa," "" "is a way of life," "" "he said in an interview with Rompeviento-TV last October." ""</seg>

<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," Bojorquez said.</seg>

<seg id="1866">If it smells wrong, it will stay away.</seg>
<seg id="1867">The trouble is, the editor of the Rioce Andres Villarreal said that "smell a sense that can be fooled... and then it happened with Javier."</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, as he and others say, apply in Sinaloa, no more - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states in which a toxic mixture of lucrative muggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials are home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is changing constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the room where the staff of Rioce met for security training, there were suddenly no mobile phones allowed. days earlier, Spyware, who is sold exclusively to governments, was used for monitoring journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside of the heat, two police officers sought protection against heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the State Government to protect the offices of Rioce in a four-storey building in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the jokes, some of the reporter asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the policemen, who identified the governor himself as trustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It is months ago, since the reporter went to the mountain scenery, where drug gangs are de facto under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the release of this week, Riodoce has blocked three main stories.</seg>

<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was enjoined to write what everyone in the city know: that the restaurant is a favourite local of drug traffickers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter learned from public notes that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who ruled the ruling instalant's Party (pri) that ruled almost all the century all political levels.</seg>

<seg id="1893">It has since then asked that she is again divided by the government because she is worried that their rage has hurt her objectivity.</seg>

<seg id="2094">"" "" "" "while advocates are building a gallery of more customers in the city, the other business also benefits, the opponents fear that the pedestrian area is bleeding." ""</seg>
<seg id="2095">Furthermore: the gallery will be held exactly on the property, on which the farms market stands, in the 13 direct market share their products.</seg>
<seg id="2096">The start of construction works will be final.</seg>

<seg id="2098">Simone Zimmer: "we've been buying almost weekly in the farmers market for many years.</seg>

<seg id="2104">Gerd Densing: "whether the directors will settle in a market hall in the gallery, the amount depends on the rent.</seg>

<seg id="2108">There is enough of them in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">You see how many Ladystores are empty here - some have been for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">But since there is not even a decent weekly market, it is the more important that at least the market hall has been preserved.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Because after all, the goods offered there is fresh, mostly offered directly from the producer and is very cheap.</seg>
<seg id="2112">As you see, shop transactions are rented in a shopping centre only by larger companies, because the rented rentals are often not portable for retailers.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Too bad, specialty stores are almost no more and what remains of it, will probably disappear. "</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping center with a market hall fits me not together.</seg>

<seg id="2117">The old EDEKA would be the solution - even in duration if the bit Gallery is actually coming.</seg>

<seg id="2124">A matching similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the space of the Fridman Gallery in New York are many faces to see - white, black and brown, which almost immeasurably hang on cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg with cheeks taps and haircut, which were sent to them by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent out the excerpts from the Fort Leavenworth, where the former intelligence service analyst was a 35-year prison sentence, after they openly made diplomatic messages about the WikiLeaks website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition opened on 2 August is called A Becoming Resemblance (A suitable similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline was transformed in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transgression and pioneering dissident, when he was only three days in his office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg has been created by the algorithmic analysis of DNA that could be extracted from the 30 portraits, such as someone could be interpreted using these genomic data - the many wise as they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also to identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, has already been spoken openly about identifying as a wife, was convicted of 20 charges in 2013, including six violations of the spy law, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Through the prison their painting was suppressed so much that there was only one photo - a grain, black-white selfie, in which Manning visibly uncomfortable on a driver's seat and a platinblonde vaulted - with which it was associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg came from the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In it, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts like cigarette stacks and chewing gum, by extracting the DNA from the waste to make a picture of what these people might look like.</seg>
<seg id="2135">This was the time they received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"" "" "" "they led an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted to accompany a kind of portrait to accompany this article," "" "said Dewey-Hagborg with a press preview of the new exhibition." ""</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed, so they took contact with Chelsea and asked her whether she wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and its imprisoned Muse became unequal to unequal letters, which carried out several letters in the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even created a cartoon by Shoili canyons, "Suppose images," who would predict a future in which the president of Chelseas would be able to see the exhibition personally.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama actually was only a few days after the book was published, Mannings release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome kind of happy meeting.</seg>
<seg id="2141">"" "" "" "there is also a bit deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, since Donald Trump leads a war against informants from the government camps and against transgender troops to find new, tweezers, which he actually should fix." ""</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg was asked for the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things come from a certain reason."</seg>

<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall is her mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandal of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hopes to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotide after the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist), as amazingly similar, at least in biological ways, all of us are.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"" "" "" "what people will hopefully take care of that our genome takes care of what we are and how openly genetic data for a interpretation and how subjective they are," "" "said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video works of 2007, Spurious Memories, too." ""</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, hence the 30 of these stories."</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in a separate room, is a page from the mentioned Comic-Novel mentioned above.</seg>
<seg id="2149">She shows Manning, as she emerges with a release of hands in the United States, such as King Kong.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"if they chill your speech, then they have won," says it.</seg>

<seg id="2296">It is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive: he wrote 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection that inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpectedly emotional.</seg>

<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate may sound for your digestive system like a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study claims precisely the opposite: a diet that is rich in flesh-based proteins and dairy products, could relieving the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable state that affects approximately 1.3 million and 300,000 in the United Kingdom, causes stomach ulls and blurities, recurring or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">During those affected, meat and dairy products are usually caught in order to relieve their symptoms, researchers found the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins to develop immune cells, which promote a tolerant intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The senior researchers, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells are patrolling in the intestine to ensure that harmful microbes hide in the food, do not enter into the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells, that are unable to resolve inflammation, promote tolerance, promote tolerance, and protect the body without damage to sensitive tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the balance is too far towards inflammation, it can result in anti-inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments, a kind of tolerance promoting immunocell in mice found that a particular bacterium can carry in its initiates.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have a link between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - that is a normal part of the gut microbioma, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan had the mice in their food, the more they had from these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and an an tryptophan abundant nutrition can tolerate less anti-inflammatory milieus if the same system work with people.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The Postdoctoral Award in Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan was investigating that a group of study mice had such cells but a different group of the same tribe, but it had not been accommodated.</seg>
<seg id="2593">You suspected that the difference had to do with the intestinal microbioma of mice - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, usually live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The mice of mice were found DNA sequenced and there were six bacterial species found in mice with immune cells, but without them failed in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were raised in a sterile environment so that they lacked an intestinal microbiome and did not develop these kinds of immune cells, and they were created by L. reuteri and Immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">In order to understand how the bacteria spread on the immune system, the researchers gave L. reuteri to grow in a liquid and then overtook small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells, which were isolated from mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerant conveyor cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component was cleaned out of liquid, it proved to be a byproduct of tryptophan Metabolism that is known as Indol-3 lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">If the researchers have doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of mice, the number of cells were halved by about 50 percent, but if the tryptoplashages were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan said that people have the same tolerant conveyor cells like mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether tryptophan products from L. reuteri develop the cells in people like in mice, but defects in relation to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">She said: "the development of these cells is probably something we would like to promote, as these cells are inflammations on the internal surface of the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially high tryptophanvalues in the presence of L. reuteri lead to an extension of this population. "</seg>

<seg id="2634">The Green Party Leader Michael Kellner urged the off-down Dutch Green Party of Elke Tets to return to their mandate.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The transition to the CDU means a clear failure of voters.</seg>

<seg id="2647">Then, when they had exhausted just new courage, the G-20 Summit of Hamburg came.</seg>

<seg id="2649">Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last powerful SPD state, lost his Nimbus that weekend, because he was sitting in the Elbphilharmonie, while his city was burning.</seg>
<seg id="2650">And because in crisis communication he was so pretty wrong, what can be done wrong.</seg>

<seg id="2717">President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and Chief officials of the White House made a tour of all 50 states.</seg>
<seg id="2718">This helicopter was made in Connecticut next to a yacht from Maine, a fireman car from Wisconsin and a forklift of Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="2719">The military office of the White House demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or questrian, barely 36 hours before the helicopters landed on the South Lawn, following the records of the Navy Helicopter Squadron One (HMx-1), the unit which is responsible for the operation of the helicopter.</seg>
<seg id="2720">"I only wanted to realize you are aware of it because it is such an unusual event of high visibility," the commander of the HMx-1 wrote on the eve of the event of its superiors, the deputy naval mandeur for aviation.</seg>

<seg id="2889">Pope John-Brother Georg Ratzinger transferred the downfall in the Domsparrow report to the abuse of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This means author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report for the Missing scandal at the Dompointed Sparrows takes care of discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">"" "Christian Weisnder, spokesman of the reform movement" "" "We are Church," "" "declared to publication against the German Press Agency, and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as by the cathedral master Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the emeritus Pope Benedict XVI, an excuse." ""</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church, when Müller and Ratzinger would express their deepest regret on their own inlet or at the back the wrong assessment of processes would be expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2894">"" "the Vatican Council" "" "Osservatore Romano" "", "however, criticized that at the coverage of violence at the Domenatzen with" "" "two measure" "" "was measured." ""</seg>

<seg id="2896">"" "" "" "the habit to designate the Catholic Church as a source of all evil, is already part of the everyday experience and prepares public opinion that" "" "writes Scaraffia." ""</seg>
<seg id="2897">"" "the principality of Gloria of Thurn und Taxis said in an interview with the Bavarian Radio:" "" "you're looking forward to the church and it's a folded fresco." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2899">They find it unfair, today's standards for past decades, because the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports on the abuse of abuse, Pope brother Georg Ratzinger also appeared.</seg>
<seg id="2901">"" "completely wrong, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who was translated" "" "My Brother of the Pope" "" "written in 12 languages." ""</seg>
<seg id="2902">"" "" "" "I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection," "" "says Hesemann," "" "for all this had nothing to do with him," "" "he evaluates the results of the final report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is in the 440-page report which was presented by the honorary citizen Ulrich Weber by the Reflecistocese of Regensburg?</seg>
<seg id="2904">"" "a total of 547 rainfall sparrows were abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s" "" "with high plaid" "" "victims of attacks, 67 Domsparrows sexually abused." ""</seg>
<seg id="2905">"" "in the final report about Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994:" "" "so summing up that Domkapellmeister has been applied in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence." ""</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially with high levels of Emotions, the punishment for the students could be more ferocious.</seg>
<seg id="2907">"" "but in contrast to numerous other accusations, many victims were rated by R." "" "General Humanity" "" "and therefore in numerous cases, despite violence, lack some positive memories with him." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report for the abuse scandal at the rainy season Georg Ratzinger took his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr. Hesemann, the 440 pages report on the "incidents of violence exercised in the" Incidents of violence, "is a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2910">"" "for a lift, many students emphasize his" "" "humanity." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">In the other, it also appears as a choleriker and perfectionist, that has become more musical than top performance in the eye.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you describe this final report as his biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: when you're reading the effort and reads the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is in it.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Just eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly acquitted of every suspicion of the Mittens or co-death in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The Gewalio processes also occured at the school, outside of its sphere of action.</seg>
<seg id="2916">You can imagine it in case, out of it too late, or first impression not taken seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">The Domspatzengymnate, on which he worked, was perceived by virtually all respondents - as literally "redemption," "Heaven" and "Better World."</seg>
<seg id="2918">"" "thus, the vast majority of his student Georg Ratzinger also provides an excellent testimony," "" "sincere," "", "" "" "competent, and" "", "" "" "competent" "", "the boys regularly supplied with cakes, cookies and candy and" "" "always surrounded by grapes of children." ""</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority surcomplained about his perfectionism and his tremendous Emotions, which led to Wutausarries as well.</seg>
<seg id="2920">He did not only threw those with chairs and threw the keyring on the ground, but also earrings out and very naughty guys from the hair or ears, he has already regretted and apologized for it.</seg>
<seg id="2921">However, to be honest, however, such education methods in the questionable time, the 1960s and 1970s, were widely used in parents like teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such rebreeder methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think each one of us was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I have also experienced this in a secular school, a state gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what, in fact, in this report, namely, sexual abuse and climate processes at the preschool, are certainly excavatellen.</seg>
<seg id="2926">"" "then you wonder if it was not more likely to do with his fame and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI, a lot of media has just thrown upon him." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2927">In the Bavarian Pope, many people who never understood him are still eager.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">"" "in the media, in connection with the report was reported a lot about the topic of abuse during the" "" "rainy Cathedral" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger in the final report also some processing or complicity in relation to sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No one of the 67 victims of sexual assaults claims to have entrusted to the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were consecrated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I never dared to speak with my father or my mother," "" "said one covered signs for the others," "" "It was all very embarrassing for me." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem in the reconnaissance of sexual abuse has been, however, that most victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they trusted not even parents and siblings, he would certainly not have a choral director, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the German sparrows student Ratzinger's role in relation to abuse failures?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questioned student formulated this way: "in regard to sexual abuse... I don't see any case in which he could have had been reviewed (Georg Ratzinger) and would have been able to stop the respective perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I think it... also for really absurd to assume that it was charged... Buben intrusive or clearer or even more likely to have opened compared to their parents, internatsconductors, confidentials, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks with him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "so the report on the very clear result:" "" "that in advance, the pupils and / or their environment entrusted him, could not be confirmed in the investigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">As for sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is therefore free of engagement from everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2943">This way, it can not be thrown out, not prevented or brought him to the ad.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore, there is no reason to bring up his good name with these contradictions, as unfortunately in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">"" "in the media was much of" "" "Gewaltexzessen" "" "at the rainy season of Domenatzen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2946">The previous domain master Georg Ratzinger is thrown into the report "Wegner."</seg>
<seg id="2947">Do he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: that's the great problem that in the reporting everything was mixed and mixed up to a giant melange from sexual abuse and Gewaltexzessen and somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But this is just a misuse of the Berichtes.</seg>
<seg id="2950">It is clean up separately: between the preschool and the secondary school of the Domenching, between sexual abuse and Gewaltexzessen, we say once, other accusations.</seg>
<seg id="2951">The report also treated incidents in the period since 1945, thus also from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was no choral director of the Domsparrows.</seg>
<seg id="2952">"" "" "" "the entire terrible test educators, the cases in which boys were violated and narrowly suffered from sadistic teachers, all at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen where really scandalous conditions have to prevail." ""</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with those, domkapellmeister of Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he got the boys first to face when she had already been on the Domspatzengymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2954">On that way, like most witnesses, the theme "Preschool" tabu.</seg>
<seg id="2955">It was only happy to be her escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "heavenly" conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different at the Domspatzengymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: indeed there was discipline, but not sadistic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">"" "and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report is coming to the conclusion that" "" "many victims" "" "have been rated" "" "the general humanity by R." "". "in numerous cases, despite violence, even positive memories with him." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2959">So, at the most, it remains the reproach to have looked off.</seg>
<seg id="2960">But, despite all efforts, the report could only define two time periods in which the states were reported at the school.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71, when he began to establish itself and from the events at a school where he was not working and responsible (so the witness) wanted nothing to hear, and then again around 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Sent Georg Ratzinger in front of the states consistently the ears?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the cathedral secondary school in which the report was even reproduced.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "in it he pointed out that," "" "the tests will continue to be practiced in the preschool." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">"" "" "" "already in view of the danger of negative media, he recommended urgent powers." ""</seg>
<seg id="2966">That was, of course, at a time when legal clarity was also banned in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that they appear in a legal grey zone, as everyone knows of us.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was hard to estimate for him, where people perhaps exaggerated or dramatized, and where really the permitted limit was exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">You can't say either, he always looked out.</seg>
<seg id="2970">That just doesn't right.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980 the test penalty of schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Principality Gloria of Thurn und Taxis said it was unfair to apply the educational standards for the time of today.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"" "Michael Hesemann:" "" "we are talking about the" "" "snare of Anachronism," "", "i.e. the danger, past to today's moral standards." ""</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess has quite right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"" "" "" "but this is not true for sexual abuse, which was abominable to all times, and not for what was broken up in the preschool of rebelliation and violence at innocent children's sake." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all very terrible and I'm glad that it's finally getting up.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection, for all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His means to be disciplined and punishment, so earear and ears to the hair and ears were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When physical punishment was forbidden then, he has also kept himself in mind.</seg>
<seg id="2981">"" "what picture of his rainy season, Georg Ratzinger has played in talks with you for the book" "" "My brother of the Pope" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the subject responded to the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI said about his perspective, so the cathedral sparrows only played a part.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I did not fail at all that he led a thorough regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But that has to be said once: without these perfectionism, without having unconditional discipline, it would hardly be possible from the until then rather nationally known Regensburger Domsparrows an institution of space, true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition that went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With cookies and candy alone, you don't have any big singers and in front of any success, at which area, yet discipline, passion and self-insurmountable.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of people did you experience Georg Ratzinger in talks about her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and in addition, I met Georg Ratzinger really well and again and again as a wonderful, humorous, homesteemed, deep believer and warm people, of which you can't imagine that he could do something in a fly.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I get regular contact with how many former Domspatzen still today, 23 years after his Emergency, visit him to read him - he is almost blind - and to treat him as a member of her family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who do not forgive him till today, that he once was strictly speaking to them, are clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most of these sparrows are grateful to him today, that he enriches their lives and brought to them the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he always was a good, paternal teacher - a strict father, certainly it may be - but also a lovable respectful person, to which they still look up and honouring them.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, even more clearly: all that you give him are guardians that were on the agenda at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad we have overcome this time long ago.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is highly unjust, a man, just because he is prominently and a more prominent brother to make the media sin-goat.</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is the evil intent which is behind it, only too obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">For the report which has just been published, relieved him.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now the stop-up areas, a 93-year old man who bought great merits and without the outside of Bavaria, and perhaps Germany would probably know the rainsburger Cathedral sparrows was finally to be in peace.</seg>
