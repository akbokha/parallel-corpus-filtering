&quot; &quot; &quot; the victim &apos;s brother told that he can &apos;t imagine anybody who would harm him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fin@@ ally went uphill on him again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the San Francisco Police Department told that death was classified as murder , and the investigation is running .
the brother of the victim , Louis Gal@@ icia , distributed the ABS channel K@@ GO in San Francisco that Frank , who previously worked as cook in Boston , took over six months ago as a cook in the Son &amp; Dau@@ gh@@ ters Restaurant in San Francisco .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man of the Son &amp; Dau@@ gh@@ ters said they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shocked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over his death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we are a small team that works like a close family and we will miss him painful , &quot; said the spokes@@ man .
our thoughts and our con@@ dol@@ ences are in this difficult period of Fran@@ ks Family and friends .
Louis Gal@@ icia admitted that Frank initially lived in host@@ els , but that &quot; things finally went uphill to him . &quot;
&quot; he found an apartment , he had a friend , &quot; shared Louis Garcia K@@ GO .
Louis Gal@@ icia said that he could not imagine anyone who would harm his younger brother .
he was a friendly man with a big heart .
to combine its kind with his family , it is always something to cook us to prepare the dinner , &quot; Louis Gal@@ icia said .
he never wanted to participate in any kind of argument .
he was the brother who sw@@ am with the river .
&quot; with everything that goes wrong in the world , he was this un@@ polished diamond that sh@@ one every day , &quot; he said .
each one who has information regarding the case will be asked to call the rear @-@ digit of the SF@@ PD under the number 415 @-@ 575 @-@ 44@@ 44 .
Jennifer A@@ ni@@ ston : I will always be put in drawers .
Jennifer A@@ ni@@ ston must not always be perfect or successful .
that made the Hollywood star in an interview now un@@ equi@@ vo@@ cally clear .
&quot; I will always be put in drawers , or I get infected by the outside label who have usually little to do with me and reality . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have the desire to always be perfect and successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; hon@@ est@@ ly , these things are rather schn@@ u@@ ppe . &quot;
Jennifer A@@ ni@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh that she is considered &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as she explains in the current &quot; Cos@@ mop@@ olitan . &quot;
best of all , the actress spend their time at home , front TV with delicious dishes and mexican food , it is called in the magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Weiß@@ gl@@ ut they bring the question about the child &apos;s desire : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t have to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Hollywood star . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - love is not a child &apos;s game , &quot; A@@ ni@@ ston is a single mother to see two sons .
the film runs on the 25th of August .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger gets the sports pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger , at the end of a golf course in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger , with some colleagues , sought a bit of variety with a ride on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden sports pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes the horses re@@ minded of their celebrations , they pursued after the feeding of the feeding .
a kilometre at this pace , I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; Lan@@ ger says .
and thus the e@@ quest@@ s ended up again .
on Saturday Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer was - 101 tournament victories - again in the vicinity of horses .
he was leading up with his family about the complex of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he didn &apos;t go for a photo .
this was the first time in Aachen and also at CH@@ IO .
the reason was absolutely convincing .
the German sports aid handed over to the man from An@@ hausen in the framework of a small gala staged Golden sports pyr@@ amids .
in awards it does not lack the symp@@ a@@ thetic sport@@ s@@ men .
Bundes@@ verband kreuz , Silber@@ nes Lor@@ be@@ er@@ sheet , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the year ...
even British Queen has already ad@@ mired him .
the 18th prize winner of the sports pyramid .
in Aachen he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award means a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for it is not only for sporting successes but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lan@@ ger has been developing the offspring for decades .
and so he continued the prize money of 25.000 Euro .
with 15 further outstanding athletes , the two @-@ time US ma@@ stur@@ b@@ ate was included on Saturday in the &quot; Hall of Fame of German Sports . &quot;
the athletes of Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the Turner Eber@@ hard g@@ ull , the grand@@ daughter Corn@@ elia Han@@ au , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , who was Mein@@ hard N@@ eh@@ mer , der Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ ek@@ e , the Spr@@ ints of Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um the hand of all Erhard Wunder@@ lich .
many of these sport le@@ gends came to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the illustr@@ ating society moves into the jumping stadium , where the Lav@@ az@@ za price ran .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger held distance to the big animals .
Clin@@ tons and Tr@@ um@@ ps Economic Policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in infrastructure and the trade agreement T@@ TP can prevent - Clinton and Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two US presidential applicants are , however , in the tax and energy policy , as well as in a fundamental question .
the differences in the economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and Hillary Clinton is a basic , rather philosoph@@ ical difference .
he , about the role of the state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump wants to keep the doubt rather small in doubt and warns about how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regul@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton wants to sc@@ orn the economy and regul@@ ate the economy , he says .
he himself would be completely different , cla@@ iming Tr@@ ump .
he will be attributed to regul@@ ators , and he makes himself strong tax reform with lower tax sets strong - for private people and companies .
Clinton said : the state has certain jobs , he has dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities to open and needs money .
therefore , taxes for the rich will increase , she says .
Inter@@ est@@ ingly , both are very close to infrastructure .
in the shots inv@@ ests , tr@@ ump and Clinton say almost the same .
the democratic candidate is announ@@ cing the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programs in the infrastructure are classical democratic policies and are rejected by the state @-@ critical te@@ ap@@ y wing of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
so on Tr@@ ump , we could still get part@@ ed internal discussions .
more clearly are the differences in energy and climate policies .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and re@@ build the coal convey@@ ing in the USA .
oil extraction should also be possible in previously protected areas , which wants to termin@@ ate the Paris climate deal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton wants to strengthen the renewable energies with its investment programme : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a country will create the super@@ power of clean energies and create millions of jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want we are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but not only during the infrastructure - even in international trade agreements the two competitors are not too far from each other .
T@@ PP , the transp@@ azi@@ fish trade agreement , both don &apos;t want to sign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , both the US don &apos;t want to isol@@ ate the international trade - but simply protect American jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they should then be paid better , Clinton for Clinton .
the current minimum wage of 7.@@ 25 US dollars is a star@@ vation wages .
it wants to raise it to 15 dollars a hour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what tr@@ ump wants to do in this question is not clear : once he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the minimum wage must be r@@ ins@@ ed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says he must not be changed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the big discussion of the coming months is likely to continue to develop the tax policy of the two camps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on one page stands tr@@ ump , who wants to discharge the economy and citizens to boost growth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his critics believe him , that the budget deficit would only be greater .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , Clinton said that at least from the rich people want to pay more taxes and their critics say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more taxes are not the solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
escape : &quot; any vacc@@ inated wife has experiences with sexual violence . &quot;
sexual violence belongs to women who flee alone , almost daily life .
if they arrive in Germany they are often trau@@ mat@@ ised .
a house offers refuge .
four women sit in a large kitchen .
each one has a baby , which is at most a year old .
one has put her little son into the arm .
he looks with big eyes curious in the room .
his mother star@@ es on the table top .
until they notice , it is observed .
they sm@@ iles and k@@ isses the little ones .
the scene works normal .
until you speak with Katrin B@@ ahr .
she is the business director of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social support in Bavaria , and deals with the topic of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are wing@@ ed .
they live in the Munich north , one of the few dec@@ entr@@ alised women and their children in Bavaria .
in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs created the establishment together with Pro sur@@ a and the Munich Women &apos;s Aid .
it has been officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men there is no - also not as visitors .
the exception is a guard at the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated to say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every woman who reaches here has made experiences with sexual violence , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee because of wars because they are politically persecuted because they are threat@@ ening torture or death , or because their families will send them as a hope for Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she tells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in women , other reasons for the escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many steal away , because they don &apos;t see another way out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in their homeland , they have experience with sexual violence , for@@ cible , hon@@ esty , slavery , or forced prost@@ itution .
it drives them away .
on the run , that goes on .
&quot; for example , the tu@@ g for a bottle of water is a sexual action , no rarity , &quot; says B@@ ahr .
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
who believe that the end , as soon as they arrived in Germany , ir@@ re , tells b@@ ahr .
here too many women in refugees were often considered inferior and worse .
this leads to about 90 percent of women who live in the housing in the North of Munich , they are trau@@ mat@@ ised .
&quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntary . &quot;
many women are so familiar to say nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or do not dare to speak openly about the earth , because the shame is too great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they often do not want to help , I need more accommodations just for them , demanding B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria , the seven District governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
on the question of whether they would like from a similar project like in Munich in its jurisdiction area , some say with no .
there is no something in the Ober@@ pf@@ alz and Ober@@ fran@@ ken there are not something in the accommodations of the governments .
in Schw@@ aben alone , women are not accommod@@ ated separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , Press@@ es@@ preach of the government .
in Ober@@ bay@@ ern , sub @-@ Fran@@ con@@ ia , there are only two floors or their own houses only for single women and their children .
the exception is Dutch , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also the committee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rights of Women and Gender Equality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament calls for women to be accommod@@ ated separately . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a study published for the committee , it says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important that men and women will be accommod@@ ated separately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; lack of privacy or men and women are accommod@@ ated together , it can go - for@@ warding - violence against women . &quot;
especially the washing rooms should be separated and accessible for women , stands in the study .
how much the women of this protection needs to be felt , you can read at the rush on the house in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since they talked about that there is us , we have a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you could easily make a second house .
Assist@@ anc@@ ill@@ aries : claims for new labor measures
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deputy representatives from assist@@ ants have called their union to appro@@ ve new labor measures in their disputes regarding a new contract . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has required its entire Council to appro@@ ve more labor measures from the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC said that there had been a minister to respond to the concerns about the contract .
in July , assist@@ ants and medical students have agreed with the re@@ jection of a contract that has been agreed with the BM@@ A .
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted in elections .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the members who had been released on Thursday night on Twitter , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; persist@@ ently quiet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would have had problems , what was rejected that the contract was rejected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In view of what has the J@@ DC board voted to fully reject the proposed new contract and calls for official new negotiations about all your wor@@ ries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an answer to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Executive Board has set a formal request for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to start a running program of working activities that starts at the beginning of September . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the disputes carried out that Assist@@ enz@@ sts jumped out this year six times , the first overall sei@@ zu@@ res in the history of N@@ HS .
according to the election of the BM@@ A Assist@@ enz@@ in@@ arians , Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana , came back to the re@@ jection of the contrac@@ ting contractual terms that had been recommended by the BM@@ A .
he shared BM@@ A members during the meetings that took place before the vote by 54@@ .000 assist@@ ants and medical students , with that the contract was advant@@ ageous and accepted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the vote , the Minister of Health Jeremy Hun@@ t said that the contract for physi@@ cians was for@@ ci@@ bly introduced in England . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; Alliance of Out@@ side &quot; ?
it was a gest@@ ure that ended a crisis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to proc@@ laim the hands and proc@@ laim an official end of eight months of the words and economic sanctions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish contra@@ g@@ amer in the g@@ ild@@ ed hall of St. Petersburg Pal@@ ast@@ es in reception , I cannot inter@@ fere with the penetration that Ankara wants to be the reconciliation of the most .
there was the r@@ ash , yes .
but Putin took dirty smile , and he had little warmth , even for his restra@@ ined circumstances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , Recep Tayyip Erdogan said repeatedly about his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; friend &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Putin - according to a report all five times . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it any more .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but will even improve .
the next day , a newspaper described that Erdogan would have heard so would be something bad .
to me , his enthusiasm seemed rather the opposite .
but one out of Putin was radiant , sustainable aud@@ ited that Russia had forgotten the President of Russia .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first , which he mentioned in his quotes : the shooting of a Russian fighter aircraft at the Syrian border through Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was turbul@@ ent .
Putin shared out and accused Ankara , Russia in the back .
the leaving was even greater , as it was done by an supposed friend .
the Vet@@ ro@@ en re@@ build is difficult , if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
during the month , the government controlled media had a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
suddenly it seemed as if the Turks would bear to blame for everything .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the most serious were the accus@@ ations from senior citizens who would have benefited their own family from illegal oil trading in the regions of Syria , which will be controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he denied this v@@ eh@@ ement .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
finally , this meeting took place just because Putin received the excuse to listen to the President Erdogan .
Russia could book a kind of victory .
for Ankara , the benefits of tru@@ ce is clear on the hand .
Erdogan is primarily necessary to get all friends who can get after the last month of a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him .
but there are economic motives as well .
Russian sanctions have hit hard against Turkey - especially the ban on bat@@ ches , which usually take several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year .
the number has declined by nearly 90 % .
in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when the flights are resumed .
they count on a late @-@ seasonal ons@@ lau@@ ght of the Mediterranean .
this week the state television predicted cheap fruits and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed .
a report in Ve@@ demo@@ st@@ i form@@ ulated it as follows : &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry at the west , as its response to the attempted power transmission was considered a weak response .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pro@@ longed Gro@@ ll on the accession talks of the EU accession talks and Putin - the pioneer there@@ on is to benefit from the cool mood and decrease Turkey &apos;s relationship to the West . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Ankara , the Russian leader won a bonus for him that after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat , he demanded support for the elected state organs .
this is well known for Moscow , self @-@ understanding that even has a deep fear of regim@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the summit meeting in this gl@@ itter@@ ing palace on the sea made it possible in Russia and Turkey , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; out@@ sider &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an analy@@ st , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two countries who viol@@ ate themselves from the West and feel badly treated and now alli@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , despite the public prop@@ iti@@ ation , there are still great differences between the two .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently gave the role as a peace maker , but where Russia and Turkey support oppos@@ ing parties . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could be pointed out that after almost three hours of first convers@@ ations , both presi@@ dents on the press conference had said that they had not even stri@@ ped the subject .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Turkey qu@@ itted it inten@@ tionally to answer a question about their differences , while Putin decided to emphas@@ ize these . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no clear con@@ sens@@ us about where a common den@@ omin@@ ator to Syria can be found .
but after months of open host@@ ilities - and in view of the potenti@@ als for a perfect disaster , when NATO member Turkey sh@@ oss the Russian combat jet - it is certainly better that the two heads will talk at least again .
Royal Bank of Scotland not available for customers outside of Scotland
according to the Chief of Staff R@@ BS , the Bank can only be reduced to a back@@ office role according to the CEO of the Bank .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside of Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan shared the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand joined the Bank &apos;s global amb@@ itions .
the Bank has dist@@ anced itself since then , when she had to be res@@ cu@@ ed and saved almost eight years ago .
in this period , brand str@@ ate@@ ways &quot; R@@ BS &quot; have used to protect other consumer brands .
she supported international sport with millions of pounds on sponsor@@ ship , the Six Nations Rug@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Murray .
but now she decided to put more national brands into the focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available for customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales all RS@@ B references , the company headquarters and stock exchange will switch to Nat@@ West .
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are others , smaller brands for private clients , which will be more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ WAN was inter@@ viewed during a tour tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Sh@@ ire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the brand RS@@ B is becoming one of our investment brand , as well as the brand , under which our employees are busy as we now become a bank of trademarks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Bank itself has become a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am now saying that we don &apos;t pursue any global targets , but local goals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
each of these brands will be completely different in their own communities and our employees will work under these brands with the customers .
R@@ BS has already told that it will not continue to continue its Six Nations Sponsor@@ ing and that it will increase the most vulner@@ ability of the various brands in his sports sponsor@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is time for us to develop to the bank of the brands , as we have focused on the inside ( we have asked ) to make this a better bank for clients ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Chief of Staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been very cy@@ n@@ ical about three years ago , if we had said we had to be a great bench for our customers and launched this brands .
but with our work , focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes .
we can launch these brands again , so I think the time has come .

Russian Putin is feu@@ d of Chief of Staff Sergei Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin reli@@ eved his Chief of Staff Sergei Ivan@@ ov .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was a part of the nar@@ row@@ ful trust of Putin for many years .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed the Special Repres@@ ent@@ ative for environmental and transport purposes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a statement of the Kre@@ m@@ lin it is that Putin ordered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dism@@ iss@@ al Ivan@@ ov@@ s by his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who was a deputy since 2012 , was named after his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
born 1972 in the Est@@ onian capital of Tallinn , he graduated from the prestigious Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the Tokyo Embassy .
on the website of the Kre@@ m@@ lin it is called Russian ( in Russian ) that he later was the head of log and Chief of the government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said to Putin on his appointment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as head of government regarding bills and inspec@@ tions to implement your instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov had asked to leave his position and advised V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
convince the smiling faces ?
this step has made mysterious inci@@ dents .
Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov was a long time that Vladimir Putin &apos;s eng@@ aging tru@@ sts and works as he works for the Soviet secret services , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
at a meeting with President Putin , who was broad@@ cast@@ ed on TV , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff returns to his own request .
but despite the smile for the cameras , only few of them are convinced - especially in front of the parliamentary elections .
so here is the result of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows that .
but the official asser@@ tion - that a man who once was as@@ par@@ ed as a potential president who wants to lead Russian environmental policy - pushed to great ske@@ p@@ tic@@ ism .
in his remarks on Putin , who are quoted on the website of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , Ivan@@ ov said it is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 , I almost say this very complicated post - one could almost say - descri@@ p@@ tive post for four years .
as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian President for four years and eight months .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V accepted the post in December 2011 .
previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and how Putin is a member of the K@@ GB State Security Service .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was Chairman of the Bund@@ essi@@ onal Service ( FS@@ B ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed his deputy .
when Putin came to power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people , whom he trusted .
once it was believed that Ivan@@ ov could lead to Putin &apos;s second term president of Russia as a third term of Putin would viol@@ ate the Constitution .
but this post was taken by another , close allies Putin &apos;s ally , Dmit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin was Prime Minister before he became President for three and a half years later .

the scheduled broadcasting of the twel@@ f@@ th season is scheduled for 28 September .
ri@@ dd@@ les around fish that landed in Ban@@ ff garden

Queens@@ ferry Crossing : bridge now connected to Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017
engineers have joined the North deck of the Queens@@ ferry Cross@@ ings with the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct , which means that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four closing stages of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; op@@ a@@ quar@@ se &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which approach the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is 600 metres long and weighs 30.000 tonnes .
it has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 Sch@@ rä@@ g valves .
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Minister of Economy Keith Brown took a visit to the site today , and was one of the first to come from country to the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a historic and symbolic moment when building the Queens@@ ferry Cross@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all witnesses of a truly ep@@ ic degree in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the failure between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that require extremely precise toler@@ ances for fit .
in total , almost 79 % of the total bridge on their square and the last section of the deck gets a bed sheet for the deck today , which means that the whole deck is ready to be lifted along the bridge to his place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Martin , project leader of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first sh@@ utter is a considerable milestone in each bridge project . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this fantastic project the closure of tr@@ end@@ setting high@@ - and deep @-@ construction represents .
following the installation of the last road deck and the connection with the Northern Tur@@ m@@ deck , we had to close the still existing gap on the North or the north side .
this was reached by pulling the northern sugar bridge 700 milli@@ metres to the south .
this was a massive and very delicate activity .
massive , since the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 222 metres long , weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be drawn up at an inc@@ line of about 3 % .
hei@@ gh@@ ty , because the toler@@ ances that the team works , tiny were - on each side they were just a few millimeters .
fortunately everything went very well .
salvation in the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men have &quot; luck to be alive &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; happiness still alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after being thrown by her fishing boat off Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station suggested on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T alarm , after a crew observed the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had difficulty swimming in safety while their boat went on from their own strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we looked like the boat turned around and put us the worst before , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the leader of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vince Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately , the strong winds have already blown the boat aside from their reach until we left water , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and hung on a bo@@ wel without a life jacket .
they all came aboard the coastal ret@@ ard@@ ship and were brought back to the rescue station
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Jones said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three men who were thrown into the water have to be un@@ hurt and still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the boat engine had a not@@ ion of a not@@ ion , however , this dis@@ b@@ anded the boot of the boat by the person who control the boat .
somebody spoke about these men today .
seriously wounded - man stands on his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man has attacked his ex @-@ friend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and severely injured .
as police told yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had the key to receive his personal things .
instead of alcohol @-@ soft tat@@ too the clothing of his ex girlfriend .
when they came into the flat , he put on them twice .
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured at hand and on the body .
the police was able to consoli@@ date the perpet@@ rators .
when the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed the clothing of his ex @-@ friend , he called his mother .
this sum@@ med up his sister .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted her brother to calm her brother together with her partner .
but she could not move it to leave the apartment .
so she went out of the house with her life .
on the road they met the man &apos;s ex @-@ life partner .
when the two women played the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old turned his sister to his side and attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend .
who builds Braunschwei@@ gs cheap apartments ?
the SPD and the Green Party : investors should become much stronger in the future .
how do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1,@@ 300 cheap apartments in the next few years ?
the SPD suggests a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; action concept &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the next rating . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but argument is programmed .
first and foremost , it is about the question : who should build the favorable apartments ?
a regulation is lacking .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D Group president Christoph Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : who wants to build urban areas in the future , 20 percent of all apartments must be present as social welfare . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the favorable apartments can also be created in stock .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the big event in the town hall is , such as Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how are investors like to build on private areas ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors at least 10 percent on such areas , but as possible as 20 percent of the apartments as a social re@@ wards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new urban housing estate program , which will cost millions of costs , and is still financed , should ensure inc@@ enti@@ ves .
the problem , as Brat@@ mann : &quot; there is no agreement between the fra@@ ctions . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CDU wants to make investors as much as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the left still wants hardness for investors .
regardless of what Brat@@ mann , you are a waste of the situation on the housing market .
the action concept is implemented , which will provide additional tasks in the management system .
more staff is required .
it is un@@ clear whether we get the skilled workers .
but the program does not yet stand entirely : the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments that should be built anyway .
but how does one compare the loss of more about 1300 favourable apartments , whose funding will run out in the next few years ?
by 2020 alone , it will be 500 apartments .
to prevent this , the plan@@ ation spokes@@ woman Nicole Palm , should now be purchased out of the city &apos;s ongoing ties .
in addition , it would have to be thought about getting apartments back into the price .
this is possible in the western town .
the problem should be solved on one fell s@@ woo@@ p .
Fri@@ sten comes to the end of the year in the western town .
around 1800 apartments you could get back to the price for cheap apartments .
only : we do not want the owners , housing companies .
because the number of social subsi@@ dies in the western town is dra@@ stically increased , one is removed from the objective of so @-@ called mixing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a concentration of social weak in just a few parts shall there be no more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Gre@@ ens expect that it will still be moving in discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D Group president Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a vast majority , the CDU must be with the boat &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s focused on more building sites for family homes .
but what does not mean , that not yet a compromise can be found .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunting trip to health and happiness that pays off
it is fascinating to watch how the world changes .
that teen@@ agers and child don &apos;t go out to play anymore , but rather prefer to spend their free time to spend their free time on screens , was su@@ ed by many in the last decade .
Pok@@ emon Go is about to get people from the sofa and to be more active .
the screen was initially limited to the TV , then on video games and at least on smartphones .
therefore , it is great to see that technology and activities did not exclu@@ de each other outdoors .
I pray you , of course , based on the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app based on the characters that were created first for video games in the 1990s ( later they created a animation series , playing cards and other spin @-@ off ) .
as many phenomena of pop culture sun@@ k the interest in the release of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand in early July .
the market launch in other countries was post@@ pon@@ ed by massive demand that over@@ load the server .
within a few days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , the players will go outside with their smartphone outside and search for Pok@@ é@@ m@@ ons , who can be followed with a GPS and as soon as they were found , &quot; photographed &quot; ( about a screen@@ shot on the phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
a generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the track and jumped for the search of the sofa .
in the US , the game resulted in a considerable increase in steps that puts the &quot; average &quot; person every day .
Cardi@@ ac , an app for Apple Watch that followed 35@@ ,000 users , the Washington Post recently distributed that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of people followed by 45 percent to 53 percent each day .
the company doesn &apos;t know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it just sees the raw data for improving performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many public recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance campaigns for health , people want to bring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be active &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be active &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on deaf ears &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because many public messages come up to health and come from people who look like . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , the importance of sports may not be assessed .
those who regularly drive sports , reduces his chances of developing cancer or depression .
physical activity helps with weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes , and a long list of benefits that is too long to introduce them here .
but the wonderful on Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that it is fun .
three pillars of health will be covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine , as well as fun .
some people go hunting even new friend@@ ships .
as always there is m@@ ür@@ rical play corrupt , which must always complain about anything .
and yes , someone could run against a door .
what is it supposed to do ?
it has taken a breakthrough .
even if smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit earlier our activity , they gave us no reason to play sports as it does this game .
the new will lose its appeal and make use of time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , due to Pok@@ em@@ ons success , there will be more games that will unite Apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ites in the real world and be helping people on the hunt to be more active , fit@@ ter and heal@@ thier . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in the dam@@ sel
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Simone Bil@@ es is immune to all that is immune .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
effort@@ less on the bar .
stunning on the ground .
on the full line brilliant .
and now the Olympic Champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American Tur@@ ner@@ in er@@ kl@@ om@@ m on Thursday to the multi campaign and enlarged the gap between themselves and the rest of the world in front of all eyes , under the spotlight of the Olympic Games .
the total result of 6@@ 2,@@ 198 was clearly in front of the silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; -@@ Mann@@ at@@ sk@@ ates in A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze medal Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
the Americans Simone Bil@@ es tur@@ nt on the pig bal@@ ks during the solo event of women at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ osex@@ ual woman who wins multiple titles and a total of the fifth , while they consoli@@ date their reputation , the best of their generation or even at all .
she broke out in tears , when her final result was shown and her long journey was at the end .
this success makes them in the same league as unique athletes such as Michael P@@ helps who brought their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ es has dominated the last three years her sport watch - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - including so amazing exercises that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Res@@ cue from her said that she is &quot; the best gymn@@ ast in which I have ever seen . &quot;
it was the last examination in Brazil , a competition that didn &apos;t go so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between it and a burden of over@@ sized expectations .
return not with a hand@@ ful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas would be regarded as dis@@ appointment .
the Americans Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace himself after they have won gold and silver in the individual multi campaign of women at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday
Bil@@ es received the first medal on Tuesday , while she retired at the farewell celebration , Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i , as a withdrawal sign .
although Bil@@ es insist@@ ed on top of their long road , never the future is planned , it is not really true .
part of their soil exercises - which contain their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is tuned to Latin American music , which would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is no co@@ incidence .
this girl , adopted by their grand@@ parents as a small child , and was discovered by train@@ ee A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans mother during a school trip to the gym , in Bo@@ or@@ man trained , was used to force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has lost no more than the summer competition for the summer of 2013 , a winning series that will hold so long as it wishes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even if Must@@ af@@ ina was easily guided by two turns , the picture sm@@ ashed .
Swe@@ be@@ bal@@ ks and Bo@@ dent@@ ure - in which Bil@@ es holds the world champion title - l@@ ous@@ ed .
she recovered again 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the pig bal@@ ks again - and with a 15.@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground still another one .
Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ ced her soft@@ ly when she was eag@@ erly a@@ waited for her du@@ ality - and tears of red , white and blue E@@ yel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in her collecting book , became reality .
the performance of Ra@@ is@@ mans was ven@@ ge@@ ance for the last time four years ago when she had fought for the third place , but the bronze medal went into a depth of Must@@ af@@ ina .
this time the 22 @-@ year old man capit@@ ol , which is called &quot; O@@ ma &quot; by the Americans , had a lead .
after their soil , she threw her to the public , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes seemed doub@@ tful .
as well as it affects , the 19 @-@ year @-@ old twe@@ et has a very new meaning at the beginning of this week :
police : 3 victims in mass mur@@ der@@ ers shot at the music in the car
according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year old girl shot , who died in one of the dar@@ k@@ est attacks since a decade in the first standard mur@@ derer of Phoenix , while they stopped in the car and heard music .
Angela Rochelle Liner , Stef@@ anie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on 12 June while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , the authorities said .
the perpet@@ rator moist@@ ens eight shots from a hand @-@ fired weapon , while on the side@@ car side of the car , and fled with another vehicle , is to read in the report .
the police told that the thir@@ teen murder would not have been the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y , since the att@@ ack@@ ers did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 , which took possession of an adult victims .
the Poli@@ ze@@ is@@ pre@@ cher by Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting has led the investig@@ ators to become a close look if it is connected to four previous attacks .
all in all , seven people were killed and two were injured in nine ass@@ aults in nine months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Howard of K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , beginning of the month . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is believed that the susp@@ ects has used several vehicles including a brown N@@ iss@@ ant from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to reveal the evidence that they were linked to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and carried out by the same mur@@ derer .
Ellis , 33 , was hospit@@ alised because of their injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and Ellis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on site .
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report on shooting mining , aimed at an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple killing and assumed that it was the work of the mass mur@@ derer .
investig@@ ators found pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ül@@ sen and secured a ball out of the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine space .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia : &quot; it becomes better &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year old Edmund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and of course his mother .
but as the fe@@ west of its anti@@ quity , Edmund Mikro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia , the result of genetic distur@@ b@@ ance that knew nothing about his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to during pregnancy .
when he first came home , my first thought , I did not create it .
I don &apos;t create it .
on this I didn &apos;t let myself be missed .
whatever is wrong -- of course you have settled down , &quot; she said .
your husband Vincent and her was told that Edmund Hillary will never be able to recognize under circumstances , and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they propos@@ e to institutional him .
&quot; my first answer to it was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &apos; declared Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to .
Edmund can run with help of a salary .
Edmund could neither sit nor speak until his third year of life . he still can &apos;t speak .
but he is slowly making progress .
he can run with support and cycling .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elizabeth shows the sign language that Edmund for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Please sing me something before &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we bring him drawing language , &quot; told Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News .
but there is no typical sign language -- she says . Edmund has invented some characters alone .
micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic such as Edmund as well as infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the Z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus during pregnancy .
symptoms and progn@@ oses can vary greatly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s still too early to say how it affect the life of infected infected with the Z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to is remin@@ is@@ cent of the emotional price of an uncertain future .
I wondered what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still don &apos;t know .
I have no longer asked about the forecast for a long time , because I don &apos;t expect somebody to really say .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of infants with birth damage caused by the Z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus .
it will be better .
they know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .

a flood warning system is used over wide parts in the south of Louis@@ i@@ anas through Saturday .
the weather service provided that additional 3 to 5 inches could drop to rain in this area .
in the south of Al@@ ab@@ amas a flood warning system was used on Friday , while in the area of Mobile continued .
the flows of Lake Como close to Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the River Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , which are both in Louisiana , will reach all probability high over the weekend .
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers could floo@@ ding many houses near Bat@@ on Rouge .
he also said that a down@@ stream flood flood in the Par@@ ish is a danger , as these are only slow to flow in the Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as .

it reached my wa@@ ist .
his wife said H@@ ans@@ ford that she lived there in the 48 years in which she had never seen such a high rise in the river .
H@@ ans@@ ford said that he and his family members would have had all the disabilities and he would be the only one who can swim .
H@@ ans@@ ford said that emergency @-@ hel@@ pers had saved all three in a large military truck and had brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were accommod@@ ated until Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the flood had spread &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rapidly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as there were still heavy rainf@@ alls and said that the authorities are evacu@@ ating evacu@@ ation instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann , an ob@@ server near Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning was 13.@@ 75 inches of rain .
K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the soil was completely al@@ igned through the rainf@@ all since Wednesday .
the authorities showed that heavy rainf@@ all and road floods have caused the rescue of residents from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa par@@ ish and in five school districts .
the C@@ BS @-@ subsidiary WW@@ L reported that a co @-@ ordin@@ ate in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa 200 flooded houses .
the inhabitants were evacu@@ ated in two churches , which are now flooded .
the over@@ se@@ er of the municipality of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities would have saved 72 people and seven pets who were r@@ ins@@ ed from floods .
in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were set up to accommodate the evacu@@ ated .

in the town of Ham@@ mond of the commune of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozens of streets were closed due to floo@@ ding and sand@@ bags provided for the residents to take away the water from their homes and shops .
&quot; the last major flood that we had was in March , &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the municipal authorities .
this seems to become a similar incident .
the emergency manager , Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Harrison Count@@ ess , said that it was still ra@@ ining on the Gulf Coast .
according to his information , a hand@@ ful of houses on Thursday have been announced as floo@@ ding , but on Friday there were no reported .

I can &apos;t believe it .
the condition of the boy was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the boy &apos;s family told the broad@@ c@@ aster that he is likely to recover .
he would have to start the first class in a local primary school .

one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are according to C@@ BS Philadelphia in a stable condition .

it seems that it clearly acted a contin@@ ual struggle .

there was no arrest and police checked by the police , according to the surveillance video .
on Tuesday another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a tor@@ ment on the arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West O@@ ak Lane .
she re@@ covers and the police are still looking for a susp@@ ect .
why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that is what I propos@@ e to me among the women &apos;s olymp@@ i@@ am@@ ann@@ ie and that is more than one reason .
first of all , I &apos;ve been with each summer olymp@@ i@@ ade since 1984 and the USA had never been so dominant .
and secon@@ dly , this team has three gymn@@ asts , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , inspiring for many young girls from other skin colour .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Je@@ w@@ in is and Madison Ko@@ cian , the Cath@@ o@@ lics , complete , makes everyone proud .
this team finally reflects the United States .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and h@@ isp@@ anic women presence at the top of this sport .
during the last four years , the number one was an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American woman .
last year , Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
that shows strength .
in the last Olympic Games Gab@@ by Douglas made a surprising Olympic champion and America .
now the world was able to witness the incredible achievement of the triple world champion in Simone Bal@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as she unexpected , but master@@ ful Gy@@ ma@@ st@@ ik@@ rout@@ ines .
on Thursday , Simone was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ osex@@ ual American woman who won gold at an individual event event for women .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we do not experience the top of this sport , but we don &apos;t see gy@@ ms around the country .
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie struck all the same way as A@@ ly and Madison , to create it into the Olympic team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Last Five &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because the next Olympic team is only four gymn@@ asts in the team . furthermore , this is the last year with Marta Kar@@ oly@@ i as a train@@ ee . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the reality looks so that Tur@@ ns will be an expensive sport and Turner at first line in private gym , which will be maintained by parents , which will be maintained for the training , retail , travel and hotel costs ( for the trainer and their Turner and families ) .
the majority of these gy@@ ms are in wealthy suburbs , which can support the business .
in these clubs , Turner will receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to families .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , train@@ ee of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , both have trained their athletes since they started with the tower .
we need to offer mun@@ icipalities Au@@ n countless , young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , become a better and easily accessible gym training .
I founded my gym for 20 years .
during my events we have offered free and affordable Tur@@ nes in Harlem for more than 15.000 urban youth ( especially black and h@@ isp@@ anic ) and trained national and international vic@@ tors .
in September , we will expand to Detroit ( my home town ) to offer the youth high quality gymn@@ ast@@ ics that make the opportunity to learn from this great Olympic sport .
Tur@@ nes develops strength , flexibility and coordination for body as well as hard work , discipline and determin@@ at@@ eness for the mind .
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health and education and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team who will bring thousands of young girls to be interested in the gymn@@ asts and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to take part in the sport , especially for girls .
this is such an exciting time .
thank you Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Madison for this true representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ es of the Olympic team gol@@ ds and thank you so many young girls are motivated to start their way to start healthy , strong and successful young women .
assist@@ ants would like to organize further strikes after the Jeremy Hun@@ t suggestion
the ministers had hop@@ ed to termin@@ ate the dispute through the amend@@ ment of a re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of 37@@ ,000 Assist@@ ants who vote in a vote , refused .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in July , Hun@@ t plans un@@ cover the agreement concluded and said that N@@ HS was in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and any further delay would be harmful to the employees and patients . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first assist@@ ants will receive a new contract , which contains changes to night and weekend work to improve maintenance for un@@ happy times . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , Chair@@ person of the BM@@ A Committee for Assist@@ ants ; last night in a communication with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; assist@@ ants have stim@@ ulated the proposed contract according to serious concerns , in particular that it will address the current workforce and to treat all doctors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at only eight weeks who remain still remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress must be made and the time runs out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
efforts by the BM@@ A to solve the dispute through talks during the government of contradic@@ tions , and sometimes de@@ af@@ ening silence on o@@ af@@ ening silence .
that was the case of a promise that Jeremy Hun@@ t had made it last month , that his door would always open up .
&quot; Jeremy Hun@@ t has to act now , raising the penetration and address the concerns of assist@@ ants . &quot;
if he did not do this , the assist@@ ants did make it clear that they are ready to perform other labor measures .
the last strike at the end of April saw a boost of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 appoin@@ tments , since nur@@ ses and medical doctors were involved in order to grant doctors on the strike post .
the ministers had hop@@ ed to stop the dispute through the changes made by the reform of the British Medical Association .
the BM@@ A wants to be a better day of week@@ days for the 54@@ .000 assist@@ ants which are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director General of the N@@ HS staff , challenged assist@@ ants to end the strike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; workers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means only little , but already over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare for the patient , care and their families just wor@@ ries , need and inter@@ ruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last two months , we talked with the assistance of the assistant , and with the Ministry of Health and other Minist@@ ries positive about the concerns and the W@@ hist@@ leb@@ ars .
the employer hopes that continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as dism@@ ay , flexibility in training , training holidays and gender pay gap in medicine - a sign for them how serious it was the employer that Health Education England and the Health Department concerning the compliance with the BM@@ A in November , February and May .
the £ 2 @-@ per Tag@@ - medication , which can reduce heart attacks
thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day medication since the authorities recommended to pass this more people for a longer period of time .
the ger@@ am@@ orous drug Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with a heart disease .
the drug is administered for 12 months after a heart attack , reducing the risk of stro@@ kes or a further heart attack .
the N@@ HS regulation authority has recommended a four @-@ year intake to further reduce the risk of cardi@@ ov@@ ascular problems .
the N@@ HS regulation authority has recommended a four @-@ year intake to further reduce the risk of cardi@@ ov@@ ascular problems .
some 14@@ 0,000 people suffer a heart attack each year and a quarter of them suffer a heart attack or stroke .
heart attacks and stro@@ kes are caused by collecting fatty material in the arter@@ ial walls , form the pads .
if the layer breaks apart , it may cause blood cl@@ ots to clo@@ g the blood flow through heart and causing a heart attack .
when the blood cl@@ ots tri@@ ggers , it can flow through blood flow and clo@@ g the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke .
people who had already a heart attack , subject to a higher risk to have another risk .
Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ zen@@ ec@@ a , is distributed under the trade name of Bri@@ li@@ que , reducing this risk by reducing the formation of blood cl@@ ots more likely .
the design draft of N@@ ICE , which was released today , recommends a 12 month intake of 90@@ mg Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE Health Organization &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention have suffered a quarter of people who had a heart attack , a heart attack or stroke . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have considerable negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
the experience shows that Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with aspir@@ in effectively reduce other heart attacks and stro@@ kes in people who had already a heart attack .
by a preliminary recommendation of Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from them .
the information on the efficacy and safety of Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of blood - is limited to a period of up to three years . the executive board does not recommend treatment over this period .
Culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ ness lets men flour@@ ish in Muslim regions
the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ let Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was transferred last year on the release of a government report because of corruption from the office
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ ness has led to the widespread election fraud in Muslim communities , as a devast@@ ating government report revealed today . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Cab@@ inet member Sir Eric Pic@@ kl@@ es def@@ aults the police , election ob@@ servers and coun@@ cils to have ignored the evidence of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ nic@@ ity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former Minister of Integration and Municipal Government , which is now an anti @-@ corrupt military motives , said that the in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation should be able to set up the police , susp@@ ect belts outside of electoral cabins to protect the elec@@ troly@@ te voters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he recommends that voters should have a reference to prove their identity for elections .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at present , a voters must call only his name and address . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report proposes that un@@ removable ink on the fingers of a person , if they vote their votes to prevent someone chooses twice .
wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lower should receive more protection , says Sir Eric .
he demands that the press should have more access to municipal documents and decisions of non @-@ official commis@@ sions or working groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this not only serves against voting , but is also to protect the municipal government before the bro@@ ader corruption and financial stability , which thereby enters , protect &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was ordered by Down@@ ing Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ lets election campaign in the east of London .
last year , a special electoral tribunal decided that the am@@ using Mayor Lut@@ on Rah@@ man should be contained in the ab@@ rupt and illegal practices of his office .
the court found that Rah@@ man had interpreted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in cy@@ n@@ ical way &quot; and that he would have put his critic with ra@@ cial and Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man should have led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his campaign on the basis for the reli@@ ance of Muslims to choose him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up to 300 votes were either doub@@ tful or the result of a im@@ itation which one person chooses someone else . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sir Eric told that it would be evidence of fraud throughout the country .
in particular al@@ ar@@ ming to the frau@@ dul@@ ent letter of letter - at the older members of the Muslim community have made pressure on people , choose a candidate of choice .
Sir Eric , pictured , made multiple recommendations to su@@ ck@@ le the electoral system including the lead of expres@@ sions to prove the identity
&quot; &quot; &quot; in his report it means : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as evidence was appropriate that pressure on needy members was administered by some ethnic min@@ orities , especially women and young people to choose to vote in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ ani or ban@@ ishing background . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were concerns that ... state institutions would have ignored such behaviour because of &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity regarding eth@@ nic@@ ity and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the ban that political activists must be able to re@@ ap &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ ap &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the report designed by Ther@@ esa May is also demanded to prevent the tou@@ g@@ her registration checks , in order to prevent the election of immigration , social and social purposes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
consider options to ask voters before choosing following your ID .
not removable ink on the finger &apos;s finger when she has given her voice to prevent someone chooses twice .
systematic reviews of the nationality of one person to ensure that they are indi@@ scri@@ bed .
a three @-@ year limitation on mot@@ ions to a automatic mail choice .
forbi@@ d@@ ding that political activists can process complete correspondence and env@@ elop@@ es of writing options .
police will give the power to set up voting stations around electoral stations .
a change of law made an indictment for in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation according to the Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 ( Volks@@ bühne Act 1983 ) .
photographer banned in election stations .
requirement that only English can be used in voting stations ( except Wales ) .
Inten@@ si@@ fication of the training , to ensure that the employees usually asser@@ t that voters go alone into the turn@@ table .
Sir Eric falls on the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing , &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ let &apos;s case no criminal indicator was given .
&quot; the electoral court gave Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his deputy for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal pract@@ ition@@ ers as un@@ fit , &quot; he said .
due to a number of reasons he was sufficiently known - according to the high demands in criminal proceedings - found guilty .
he also critic@@ ises the effective &quot; Ab@@ ha@@ k@@ controls &quot; of the registered registry of the Rath@@ geber .
Sir Eric said : &quot; the court in Tower Ham@@ lets of last year was a warning signal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our country bears a proud legacy as the mother of parliament , but the wor@@ rying and conce@@ aled spread of election fraud and den@@ ial of some authorities , threat@@ ening this good reputation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
crazy for K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gän@@ ker and other famous Doppel@@ gänger written by olymp@@ ic port@@ lern in Rio
this week &apos;s fans of the Rio Olympics in Rio , this week passed over the French cycling sport@@ s@@ woman Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot , which has proven to be an impressive double @-@ singer of the Du@@ chess in Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olymp@@ ion@@ ik@@ in is by far not the only one to win gold @-@ fighting Ath@@ let , who has his own famous Doppel@@ gänger - at least , if one must grant the social media faith .
to honour the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces , which are currently running on our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olymp@@ ians who have more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Holl@@ y@@ wood@@ land .
the h@@ unter and wolf : team member of the U.S. team in the ar@@ cher@@ y Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , is compared with Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o since his childhood .
besides the double @-@ course on the Rad@@ r@@ enn@@ bahn many people were pointing out on the Internet , as a certain ar@@ cher of the Di@@ dy@@ mus of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o could be .
the team member of the U.S. team in the ar@@ cher@@ y Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused a ons@@ lau@@ ght on Twitter for images on which he looks similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star .
indeed , the ar@@ cher got the mad@@ ness in the social media with and gave to hear that he has been heard since his childhood , that he looks like Leo .
&quot; I see no great simil@@ arity with the exception of the facial hair , &quot; said Bra@@ dy the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a well @-@ looking guy , so I can do it as a compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be at the focal point : the striking simil@@ arity between the British Weit@@ inger Greg Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris .
the Russian gymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with its big , expres@@ sive eyes should go through as a double @-@ course for the Cuban American singer Gl@@ oria E@@ ste@@ fan .
and in the swimming pool , the South African swi@@ mmer Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with the Gle@@ e Star Matthew Morrison .
a hall@@ way higher : this user is the view that Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version of the In@@ c@@ aster Schauspiel@@ ers &quot;
another tender comparison has been drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , who has similarly heavy eyebrows and lips .
the Russian silver medal floating in Yu@@ lia E@@ f@@ im@@ ova has more than just the sunny , skin and blonde hair like the actress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the American Nathan Adrian of fans was tested , an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and Dexter actress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar facial form and eyes
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that other simil@@ ar@@ ities are also fallen .
according to this user , according to this user there is perhaps a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Twitter user explained their satisfaction that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the US football star Hope Solo and the Dexter actress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar facial form and eyes .
other popular compar@@ isons of Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile that is almost identical with the actress Laura Lin@@ ney , as well as the gold med@@ alli@@ sts in the Tur@@ ning Gab@@ by Douglas , which has its own beautiful , big smile that re@@ sembles the Bring It On Star Gabrielle Union .

viewers in Canada responded quickly after they were shocked by the sound and language .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Em@@ met@@ t Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ aked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Did the C@@ BC comment@@ ator just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old swim in China &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a pig died &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? ? ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idi@@ ot hasn &apos;t seen it that they were still on show . &quot;

the criticism of Byron Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came quickly and hard , where many of them asked him .
Twitter users did not go back when they heard how un@@ sensitive Byron Mac@@ Donald was
another Twitter user in Sarah Paradi@@ s wrote : &quot; Wow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald .
you do not work the C@@ BC and Canada and lets us look like shave . # fixed .
short time later , Scott Rus@@ sel , who hosted the C@@ BC show broadcast live for the comment of Mac@@ Donald , saying , &quot; We are sorry that the comment was broad@@ cast@@ ed over a swim @-@ performance . &quot;
it was a un@@ fortunate form@@ ulation , we &apos;re sorry that it happened . &quot;
C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed for more than 90 times in the people who responded to the comments on Twitter
the comment@@ ator Scott Rus@@ sel had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze in the name of Mac@@ Donald .
C@@ BC Cop@@ ted and his excuse for more than 90 other Twitter users who had compl@@ ained about the comments of Mac@@ Donald
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and issued a message .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we regret it correctly that these statements were made , making it possible to be broadcast . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we had ap@@ ologi@@ ze quickly to our spectators yesterday night and our fol@@ lower@@ n in social media .
to declare one , Byron &apos;s comments is based on the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and not on them as a person .
nevertheless , they were in@@ adequate and un@@ happy elected form@@ ulation . Byron does what he said is very sorry .
on Thursday afternoon , Mac@@ Donald ap@@ ologi@@ zed in the show and tried to justify his comment by saying that it was not his intention that it is designed as a personal attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment to make myself a comment which I made after the s@@ war@@ ms of women in the C@@ BC Olymp@@ is@@ let , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I clicked on the performance of the swimming pool and not related to them as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course there was no dis@@ regard , and I &apos;m very sorry . &quot;

the buyer did not know where to see when a woman drew their clothes in the midst of a Pri@@ mark to try to give sub@@ pants .
to wor@@ sen the situation , she whis@@ pered , as she saw her , she pulled out and put them back to the shelf .
she moved on and tested four pairs of under@@ pants in a store at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place shopping center in Folk@@ est@@ one .

&quot; &quot; &quot; a mother of two children , Jenny Davi@@ d@@ son , who was at the same time in the shop , said that after the mysterious woman had tried under@@ wear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she went back and left the shop without buying anything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she said , &quot; The people could not believe what they saw . &quot;
in the middle of the sales area she took a pair of under@@ pants from the position , with@@ drew their own bou@@ ti@@ ghts and pants and tast@@ ed them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she did not even try to find a somewhat dis@@ crete location to do it - she just stood there , fre@@ ch like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone was star@@ red when they pulled away the under@@ pants , which you obviously did not like them back to the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she repeated the same with three other sub@@ h@@ osen , before they finally decided that you didn &apos;t like anything to get back and r@@ ushed out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it didn &apos;t seem to inter@@ fere with someone to think or think about the person who would buy shelter under circumstances . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; woman Davi@@ d@@ son , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How to think that someone would take shelter with home who had another person and not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs Davi@@ d@@ son added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I have received , the staff attempts to draw out pieces from the sale , after she went - what is so good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate it , going home with a new pair of under@@ pants and find out that another woman had her and did not wash them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man of Pri@@ mark said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is on Tuesday August 9th in our branch in Folk@@ stone , consci@@ ously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

how to protect arms with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a against arms attacks
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video from D@@ ail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it a bit safer .
we talked to Rh@@ one Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand@@ master of Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to move with armed rob@@ bers at close distance .
regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or behind it will show you this video how to turn it out for your pre@@ dat@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you are coming back from behind , you should first turn it out so that you can see your att@@ acker and go out of the line &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
grab the weapon between your fore@@ arm and your shoulder before using it with your free el@@ bow to face .
then hit him with the knees and turn it out , while the att@@ ack@@ ers come together in pain , the weapon out of his hands . beat him with the run into the face and move backwards while she set the weapon on him .
with att@@ ack@@ ers , which approach from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the gun , sei@@ ze the weapon and turn them so that the att@@ acker cannot shoot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shift the weight at the same time and beat the att@@ acker on your chest , then turn off the weapon out of his grip before moving backwards and raise the weapon to him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it makes Miz@@ ra@@ chi &apos;s doing .
but remember that it is saf@@ est in a rob@@ ber@@ y to survive your money - if you are not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ master .
tour Ian Wright sch@@ ab@@ t for a gu@@ ide@@ book his tongue in the dirty places of Europe
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a British trav@@ eller moved his immune system and dig@@ ging in a serious examination by taking some of the dirty and most gay places in Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the moder@@ ator and travel writer Ian Wright , 51 , from Suff@@ olk sa@@ wed his course on a Euro notes , a ban@@ ister on Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a slip wheel of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resistance of its immune system .
before closing of each object , it used an L@@ umin@@ ometer to show up and show us what he is going on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the experiment that was filmed under the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; brought some surprising results in daylight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the thought , de@@ cking a draw kno@@ b of a draw room , which has already been used by thousands of others may be completely rep@@ ul@@ sive , but actually there are no more bad bacteria in a kitchen wash@@ le .
on his journey through Europe Mr. Wright with doctors and medical professionals across the promotion of intestinal bacteria and its own health .
fortunately , nothing left what he le@@ aked , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth .
Mr Wright has been known to test the resistance of his intest@@ ine by travelling through the world , and ate pec@@ uli@@ ar as well as wonderful things .
from public funds to railway stations up to r@@ ins@@ ul@@ ls of toilets , the task assigned its immune system definitely among a sample
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he told : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already as a kid I was relatively worried about what my health concerns and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , worms and mud . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the film he was justified with his call .
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
its pro@@ be@@ zel showed a L@@ umin@@ omet@@ rium of more than 4000 units .
compared to this , the L@@ umin@@ omet@@ rium is less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet which he refused to wi@@ pe off after their L@@ umin@@ omet@@ er@@ ts more than 4000 units , while fresh washed hands have a less than 60
Mr Wright and the Finnish producer of dairy products vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the bacterial number in different places like the bathroom
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this comes to the worst what I smo@@ ked in a toilet , close . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing dirty than that !
I will not lick anything here , because there is indo@@ ors here .
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish producer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company equi@@ ps Mr. Wright with Vali@@ o Ge@@ fil@@ us , which contains both lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promoting of intestinal bacteria and immune system .
vali@@ os Senior Venice President for Snacks , S@@ haf@@ ts and New Categories N@@ iko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we wanted to offer the consumer really something new .
something fascinating to watch , and at the same time the benefits of pro@@ biot@@ ics are explained .
we performed crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ m@@ ings , who ended that we said &quot; Let us call us Ian . &quot;
they claim that the interest in intestinal health becomes a global phenomenon
instead of talking about the products we wanted to put them in a bigger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of intestinal health and how it is associated with the immune system .
the growing interest in health is a global phenomenon and in the documentary we could provide more information on an interesting way through the consumer .
I think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humor !
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the film direc@@ ting the film , added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian , that I had instructed out some of the things I have instructed him , like the cute Russian toilet which is shown in the film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course there was things in which it was easier to get Ian , to lick them and others , in which this was quite difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad that we recorded some of these dirty treats on film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in one of the validity of the survey conducted in 2015 , 84 percent of all survey@@ ed lac@@ tic acid bacteria in particular with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ine and 58 percent said that they use at least occasionally products that contain attached lac@@ tic acid bacteria .
A@@ social family destroyed Del@@ og@@ ation Social apartment in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
a civil family left their social housing after a delay with a damage in the amount of £ 50.000 because they had terror@@ ized their neighbours .
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ aun Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from her property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after they were for@@ cible from their estate , employees found the property to be property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition .
the walls were scre@@ wed up , wood legs were blown up , rub@@ b@@ ish was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ffiti was lubri@@ cated to walls .
the family were moved and it is believed that they now lives in a private accommodation
Donna Mc@@ Ev@@ oy , who works for the in @-@ house administration at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that she was afraid that the apartment was no longer repair .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare for the people here and I am the view that people don &apos;t need to live in this way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many things to consider since this estate is thought to be regarded as not as beautiful part of Corn@@ walls .
the family is not@@ orious and its reputation is also .
the couple had three sons , who had lived in the apartment and the police told that the terror that had joined the family , street fights with bas@@ eb@@ all@@ ele , drug abuse , drug traff@@ icking , drug traff@@ icking , stri@@ fe and flu@@ ffy .
Skel@@ don , 47 whose name stood on the lease , got an arrangement for ant@@ is@@ o@@ cial behavior in June .
in some rooms of the house that will be torn down under circumstances , old tr@@ ash was found
it was found in the estate where drugs traded in the past , the wooden legs were up .
neighbours said they saw them on the street and regularly had to be called the police .
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing del@@ og@@ ged them and her partner this week for@@ cible by the estate , after them gave them an extended period of 11 weeks to extend voluntary .
the Del@@ og@@ ation were che@@ ered by lighten@@ ed neighbors , who said that their lives are made to hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You did not join anybody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived for 20 years beside them and it was always bad .
the countless times we the police are saying here are incredible .
&quot; today we could not sleep . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - that &apos;s not usual !
now , where they are gone , it will be beautiful .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that the family had to cooperate with the local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police was sum@@ mon@@ ed at regular intervals , 20 years long .
rub@@ b@@ ish and old toys were thrown on the over@@ grown side of the community .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a shame that it ab@@ duc@@ ed to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and their family , as a del@@ og@@ ation is always the last step to consider Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was a very difficult case , because the behavior was extremely difficult and their deeds had to be dre@@ ad@@ ful for their neighbours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the commune , who have gone cour@@ ageous to us and have provided us the information . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I hope that this development will don@@ ate consol@@ ation , and the message convey@@ s that ant@@ is@@ o@@ cial behavior is not toler@@ ated .
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house , but they all have over 20 .
a dirty mattress located in one of the bedrooms of the house after the del@@ aying on the ground .
workers in the house management are now returned to land@@ scap@@ ing facilities , that surround the house
in 2014 the police conducted a raid in the house and took over 70@@ g of cannabis as well as scales , par@@ ap@@ her@@ ed@@ als and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
Skel@@ don received a fine , after they found guilty of the possession of a drug class B in trading view .
she claimed that the money for a tom@@ bst@@ one of her son Lee Skel@@ don was born in 2013 with a car accident .
after they were without the Ob@@ d@@ ach , it is assumed that T@@ anya and its partners are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth .
many rooms of the house were gra@@ ffiti with gra@@ ffiti .
the police tells you to del@@ ing rent@@ ers , which will not hold the house rules
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Angela Cro@@ w from the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall shared that the Del@@ og@@ ation was a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants , which hold not to the house rules . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who can act without self @-@ accus@@ ations , as well as those who have been damaged by such a behaviour , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall will never toler@@ ate criminal and ant@@ is@@ o@@ cial behavior that continue to work with partners to protect our communities .

the &quot; Golden Grand Slam &quot; won the &quot; Golden Grand Slam &quot; with success at the World Cup , World Cup , World Tour Fin@@ al@@ tur@@ nier and Olympia .
bronze went to the Japanese Jun Miz@@ ut@@ ani .
the two Chinese did it as expected in the final game and made the title among themselves .
this meant it was clear that for the third time a Chinese Chinese title would take place in the signs of five rings .
last non @-@ Chinese on the top Olympics of Olympia was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ Leg@@ ion@@ ary Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
Ma and Z@@ hang were left alone on the plate alone , between sentences and time @-@ outs they had no co@@ aches with themselves .
they had gone back to the tri@@ b@@ une and left their tren@@ ches in a fair competition alone .
&quot; the Mat@@ ches until now I played for my country . &quot;
&quot; in the final I play for me , &quot; Z@@ hang fol@@ ky said .
after the game posed gold and silver medal winner with the China flag .
the match itself was un@@ exp@@ ec@@ tedly on the one side .
Ma had only really strug@@ gling with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent in the first set .
after that he set the pace on the plate and let Z@@ hang down only a total of 13 points .

Donald Tr@@ ump cle@@ ars ″ massive problems ″ in the election campaign
the leadership of the U.S. rep@@ ublic@@ ans will pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive wor@@ ries , even in traditionally conservative federal states .
the presidential campaign of Donald Tr@@ ump now gave weakness of his campaign campaign in the Republi@@ can stron@@ gh@@ old Utah .
a rare moment , in which the m@@ ultim@@ illi@@ on@@ aire occurring m@@ ultim@@ illi@@ on@@ aire precisely expressed as concerns expressed as correspon@@ dents .
having thrown 16 ri@@ vals within its own rep@@ ubli@@ can camp , the doubts still grow to his success in the fight around the White House .
&quot; we have tremendous problems in Utah , &quot; said Tr@@ ump to evangel@@ ical Christians , which he asked for support in important federal states such as Ohio , Florida , or Virginia .
debt should be false reports about his can@@ did@@ acy , he resumed his well @-@ known media reports .
rep@@ ubli@@ can stron@@ gh@@ olds w@@ ack@@ eln
Utah is usually a secure bank for the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
according to a survey of Sur@@ vey@@ s USA from June , tr@@ ump and his opponents were demo@@ cr@@ ative of demo@@ cr@@ ats , Hillary Clinton .
other institutes may see tr@@ ump in front , but not by the distance that are common for rep@@ ubli@@ can candidates in the state .
as endangered , Arizona and Georgia also apply .
in an interview by the Sen@@ ders CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump responded to the question as he would like to stop the Clin@@ ton &apos;s advance : &quot; just as I did so far . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and if : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be either successful or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he do not make anything other than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the truth to tell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is not enough for him at the end of the political correc@@ t@@ ness , this is ok , Tr@@ ump said further .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , the Party of Tr@@ ump is to cut out funds to support his electoral campaign , he should not present better demand values .
instead of trying the candidates of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans to join the Congress more than arms .
Olympia : dre@@ ister Sc@@ am at D@@ oping Test
the IO@@ C wants to set up a disciplinary commission for the event .
Ken@@ yan athletes threat@@ ens the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro Un@@ reported after the second d@@ oping affair .
after an attempt at an emergency test in a d@@ oping in the Olympic village , Kenya sent a coach home .
the International Olympic Committee announced to establish a disciplinary commission in order to investig@@ ate the case .
a Ken@@ yan function@@ ary was informed that the former Spr@@ inter and today &apos;s coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , in the Olympic village had an Ur@@ in sample under the name of the 800 @-@ meter L@@ äu@@ er F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i .
this was the Team of Ken@@ yan as reported by the D@@ oping Controll@@ ers .
the IA@@ AF World Association has searched the IO@@ C for information on the case to strict their own investigations , a IA@@ AF part@@ er shared .
&quot; according to the results of the investigation and the following measures of the IO@@ C , the IA@@ AF will make an assessment , &quot; it was named in an IA@@ AF Declaration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the D@@ oping control station and was spent as a F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i , the rehear@@ sal and signed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ken@@ yan boss de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was owned by the ac@@ credit@@ ation of the athletes who stood on the list for training checks of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i turned over 800 meters in 2015 in Beijing &apos;s World Championship .
four days before , the Ken@@ yan athle@@ tics deleg@@ ate , Michael Rot@@ i , was deduc@@ ted from the Rio Olympics .
he should have informed about cash payments athletes of his country over upcoming d@@ oping tests .
according to media reports , he should be arrested in Nairobi at his return at the Nairobi airport .
Kenya has already been under special observation at the IO@@ C after many d@@ oping divisions .
in the announcement of the IO@@ C for more than 2000 D@@ oping target controls , before the Rio Olympics , previously pointed out that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia were taken into the visor .
prior to summer playing in Brazil , the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency had a lot of pressure on African country to create an anti @-@ d@@ oping law and a functioning control system .
the law was adopted a few weeks prior to Olympia @-@ Start .
as a result , WA@@ DA Kenya participated from the list of countries whose d@@ oping combat is with the rules of WA@@ DA .
Kenya is considered a great runner @-@ nation .
the athletes of the country won most medals at the World Cup 2015 in Beijing .
in a series of TV reports , the ARD system was repeatedly claimed that d@@ oping means is easily accessible in Kenya &apos;s d@@ oping means and there is a considerable ment@@ ality of the sport bet@@ ting .
IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und recently challenged a similar investigation in Kenya as he had hired them in Russian athle@@ tics .
it could be demonstrated that in this sport @-@ type nationwide and system@@ atically ins@@ ulated .
Russia &apos;s athletes were subsequently excluded from the summer games .
Salzburg &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Cecilia Bart@@ oli
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the Shakespeare @-@ year the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Tony and Maria as tragic lovers , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a surprising Cecilia Bart@@ oli .
a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story &quot; , Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ st@@ eins master@@ piece .
the artistic director Cecilia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and filled themselves with the role of Mary a youth room .
in the orchestra the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of Venezu@@ el@@ an Di@@ ri@@ gen@@ te Gust@@ avo Dud@@ amel : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he war@@ med .
we always say that they are very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their pace and melody .
it is a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have Bern@@ st@@ eins of music in our blood !
in this production Bart@@ oli plays an older Maria .
she re@@ members her heart with Tony , while the younger Mary plays and dances .
the role of Mary always fascinated me .
first because they are musically exceptional !
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
she tells her song : &quot; I feel Pre@@ t@@ ty , oh so Pre@@ t@@ ty , I feel Pre@@ t@@ ty and wit@@ ty and B@@ right . &quot;
it is therefore smart , of course na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passion@@ ately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she re@@ sembles me very much , my Italian character , whom I have as Rö@@ mer@@ in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dud@@ amel is full of praise for the opera singers : &quot; Cecilia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honour for us to work with her .
it is an enormous man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dud@@ amel is such an extraordinary artist and passion@@ ately ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
you see it in any of his movements , in his eyes , it is his life !
it is such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and a cheerful approach to life , that &apos;s very important !
&quot; &quot; &quot; Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for American director Philip W@@ m . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this piece is about pre@@ judi@@ ces and fan@@ at@@ ism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
today , we took the refugees , the Pu@@ cc@@ ess@@ ans went to New York , and the New York inhabitants didn &apos;t want them .
these are the same themes , and they are just as meaningful as at that time .
59 years later , the piece is still relevant .

SU@@ LT@@ ANA was 17 years old and died after her family &apos;s family shortly after she had taken to leave the war , and return to England .
&quot; you can only hope that the only good thing is in it - as a reminder and warning to others that these risks are involved in a war zone - people who ever wanted to make this decision , &quot; said Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e .
in February 2015 , SU@@ LT@@ ANA and two other school cities from the East of London went into a plane to Turkey and then take a bus to the Syrian border .
sult@@ anas Family was told that she married an ISIS fighter in Syria - and has been a widow within a few months .

Tre@@ ats want nude calendar for &quot; women and for men &quot;
the Tre@@ ats Magazine works with the photographer David Bel@@ lem@@ ere together to bring an early 1970s Pi@@ relli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .
but instead of famous naked gri@@ ppers , they want to find the next generation of top models for their N@@ U Mus@@ es calendar for 2017 .
the chief editor of Tre@@ ats Steve Shaw told us the beginning this year that his nude magazine of Classic school @-@ PLA@@ Y@@ BO@@ YS distingu@@ ishes , as &quot; Play@@ boy for Men . &quot;
I do this for women .
apparently , he is the view that it does not do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to return to portra@@ yal of timeless and classic n@@ ud@@ ity , in which both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Shaw in a press release on the publication of the calendar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
women will be participating in this project because it is a wonderful artwork .
models can submit their pictures online or personally at open cast@@ ing call in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kurdish community reck@@ ons with weapons
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who does not fit and pra@@ ises Erdogan is sitting on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ nearest foundation Dialogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Kurdish community of Germany expects short @-@ term protective seek@@ ers to flee from Turkey to Germany .
in the medium term , it could even be &quot; a few hundred thousand , &quot; the president Ali Top@@ ra@@ k believe .
due to the hard work of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the attempt to attempt , the Kurdish community of Germany expects a mass killing to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the short term , I deal with tens of thousands of people from Turkey in Germany , when the Erdogan regime continues fighting the min@@ orities and the democratic opposition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the President Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the government had passed the Kurdish high bur@@ ners with criminal charges , 500,000 Kurds have over Turkey on the run . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the failed put@@ sch still sec@@ ular and op@@ position@@ ist ethnic Turks are added .
many will begin to re@@ boot in Europe if they are further supp@@ ressed in Turkey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can not be that a state , which itself decre@@ es refugees , produces refugees in their own country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the officer compl@@ ained to the sett@@ ling of Syrian Arab in Kurdish , but also in Alg@@ ev@@ it@@ ische cities .
this means that Erdogan wants to increase the withdrawal to the remaining Kurds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the last major minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have already been exter@@ min@@ ated or distributed in the past hundred years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CDU member . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the government demanded that the federal government has positioned themselves &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sharp@@ ly as Austria against Erdogan and his followers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Germany there is also a &quot; wit@@ ches @-@ hunt &quot; against Erdogan critics .
in the last months I won &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad .
more Turks are seeking asylum in Germany , especially Kurds and opposition .
the fire market as Gü@@ len followers destro@@ ys teachers and other ac@@ adem@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who does not fit and pra@@ ises Erdogan is sitting on wrapped caffeine , by the way the Kem@@ alists and sec@@ ular , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ nearby foundation dialogue and education , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; world &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the newspaper reports on appeal by the Federal Ministry of Education , the Turks had already recognised the largest group of asylum seek@@ ers in Germany before the coup .
as of June 30th , this 11.@@ 386 people have been entitled to have been entitled ( 3@@ 9.@@ 625 ) by just under 29 percent of all times .
in this survey , it is not found out of war , poverty , or perspective .
asylum seek@@ ers according to the Basic Law are exclusively political , so by state side , individually persecuted .
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; go there where it hur@@ ts &quot;
Sel@@ ts@@ y Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals get nothing from the summer campaign with - and the tourists from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia must not choose the country &apos;s day .
they understood in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern .
by 2021 , the country code will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays , the heavy parliament decided at the beginning of the year .
for so far as far as it does not work : summer holidays , heat and d@@ ag@@ erial struggle - that bit@@ es itself .
the natives , who are convinced by the fighters , are on vacation .
most tourists who are in the country are on the way to Use@@ dom , R@@ ügen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not a locals , so you may not choose the country &apos;s day .
these are practical problems : among the vac@@ ations are hel@@ pers who infl@@ ate posters , fl@@ yers , fl@@ yers and count them at the end of the vote , just tired .
until September 4 , 2016 , the election and last holiday day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern once again has to pass over the people over the crowd .
the hot phase , if you can say that , has just begun .
and it is also about something : Prime Minister , Erwin Sell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CDU coalition , must be afraid of his office .
the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly within the CDU behind the CDU .
exciting is cut off , as strong new@@ comer AF@@ D and what remains at the end of coalition .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years of age and head of government since 2008 , makes an almost un@@ remarkable election campaign , one sees from its large posters .
he travels through the land , spread ro@@ ses and ch@@ unk@@ ses a little with the people , like it did his legendary &apos; word@@ search predecessor Harald Ring@@ stor@@ ff .
otherwise , soul has got cold feet , and Angela Merkel gives the gu@@ ilt the gu@@ ilt of the AF@@ D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their refugee policy , you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We create this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have accelerated the rise of the sp@@ sp@@ op@@ u@@ ists , which will probably cost him this beautiful ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CDU with its top candidate , the Minister Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is when you make a false time at the right place .
she has been invited to major German chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel twice ; Merkel of the German parliamentary circle is in the northeast .
but the target group did not agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Mecklenburg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was probably the majority of other federal states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vincent Kok@@ ert , General Secretary of the CDU in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in NDR . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it also does not pity anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel .
otherwise , the North East @-@ CDU abst@@ ain largely on market sites and shopping m@@ alls with umbre@@ llas and air balloon .
this means Kok@@ ert , plays only a &quot; sub@@ ordin@@ ate role . &quot;
the Union , too , has noted that on the country , it ra@@ ined the base that they must become very strict , to find a wire back to the people .
you are on the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens , hardly available in the borders of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Council of the CDU class co@@ ded to his co @-@ elec@@ tors : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to go there where it hur@@ ts where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ est , Golden Wed@@ dings , any birthday party needs to be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because much on the game , Sell@@ ering has called for its SPD to a particularly committed campaign .
in p@@ olls the Social Democrats last with 22 percent behind partners ( 25 ) and only slightly ahead of AF@@ D ( 19 ) .
in the election of 2011 , the SPD had still won 3,@@ 5,@@ 6 percent prior to the CDU ( 22 ) .
the Gre@@ ens , Klein@@ par@@ tei with seven percent in the p@@ olls , will probably create the jump in the country day .
they make a modern virtu@@ e of your holidays , and make their election , most of them on the Internet .
&quot; online election campaign &quot; it calls the President Claudia Müller .
otherwise green const@@ itu@@ tors go to local celeb@@ r@@ ities according to local celeb@@ r@@ ities among the tourists .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ ek , the top kan@@ di@@ dat@@ in , kur@@ v@@ t just with a house@@ boat through the m@@ ec@@ kl@@ en@@ bur@@ gian lakes and finds it beautiful .
your impression : &quot; electoral holiday in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot;
B@@ 27 restoration : restaurants suffer from locking
at the speed with which the B 27 is re@@ formed , there is nothing to complain about .
for officers of the construction work , starting at 5.@@ 30 o &apos;clock in the morning , and only at 8 o &apos;clock , there are always great praise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they made all quite a cr@@ un@@ chy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ vir@@ a T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff tells of the jet petrol station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a super team .
there is no default .
the construction site was scheduled to be moved to the south during the beginning of October , until the end of October everything will be ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be praised , even if the work is responsible for the construction work , about when it comes to the facility . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the construction site passed on Monday to the south , and also the lock of the Asp@@ erg@@ road in O@@ fan@@ d@@ ingen has been lifted and also the connection to Rot@@ tenburg was restored , the traffic situation within the resort has relaxed .
the citizens are now able to drive from O@@ fan@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 again on both sides .
sof@@ ten@@ ing through the place seems to go back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were some considerable problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Chief Executive Director of the Re@@ furb@@ ishment Director Florian King . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the local residents of Bach@@ ar Road , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ n@@ erst@@ raße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many cre@@ ators were looking for and rather their Nav@@ i trusted as the signs .
what led to that some trucks in residential areas are twi@@ sted .
because the speed limit@@ ing have not been observed , the assembly increases the measurement vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen .
&quot; there were considerable convic@@ tions , &quot; says King , who made himself a location about the situation .
there are already two to three per minute .
the quick@@ est speed was on the way at 77 km / h in the pace @-@ 30 zone .
since the construction site has been moved , it has become qui@@ eter .
for the business people at the B 27 it is only a little consol@@ ation that for clients from Rot@@ tenburg well the road is open again .
business people don &apos;t like to look at the cards .
but that the B 27 refurb@@ ishment has led to them too low in sales , everyone lets you ask , through .
however , some are more and some less affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; who has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; less to do with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; end customers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; so for other firms , the rehabilitation has barely any consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also at the Aut@@ oh@@ aus Mai@@ er Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most slight decline , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but also a one that of course &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is missing &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most explo@@ ited is the local along the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly Krone , finds obvious words .
this is already existing .
not only him , but all the restaurants have made it hard . &quot;
the customers were missing from He@@ ch@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ tw@@ eil .
we have to be happy about every euro turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he ob@@ jected net sales to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far more than 50 percent &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the road passes have put its operation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has granted half of his staff .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half had been dismissed , the policy would have re@@ acted differently .
instead , President Jörg Schmidt received a request from G@@ öh@@ ner if there would be a financial compensation , the restaurant also benefited from the advantages of the location on the B 27 . now they also have the draw@@ backs that surrender to the refurb@@ ishment .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other land circles , where something was more generous .
with all suits , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue .
after all , family business has been settled since 17@@ 15 , he refers to the long history .
that other regul@@ ars are now less often referred to because of the complicated traffic guidance , it can understand .
if you can &apos;t drive , it &apos;s also somewhere else .
after the end of the rehabilitation work , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubts about it .
despite the crises of BSE and a bird flu , G@@ öh@@ ner holds the effects of the B 27 construction work on its customers for the biggest crisis that his inn has experienced in many years of history .
construction works for six months , this has been brutal .
constantly scre@@ wed in the name of the terrorist control in laws .
following recent attacks , Minister of the Interior de Mai@@ zi@@ ère now suggests a thick security package .
but what has a D@@ ul@@ ite status to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all this ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the Com@@ promis@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all his proposals are politically reasonable to the coalition partner &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Federal Minister of Justice at the launch of his new security package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are calling for no one .
other , further points would first be discussed within the parties .
I too beg@@ ged myself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but as Minister of Interior , however , be found on results and at a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; con@@ sens@@ us con@@ sens@@ us within the coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; de Mai@@ zi@@ ère &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Mai@@ zi@@ ère &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after recent attacks in Würzburg , and Ans@@ bach , he will present a little time before moving to the security in the Republic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but these are all the more extensive .
a lot has already been announced , announced , announced , that a new security authority should take care of the cra@@ b of encrypted communication , is not new .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not the fact that Germany has to implement multiple EU requirements for passenger data and arms . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the call for more video surveillance and personal security personnel is also not surprising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for part , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère starts a second run for proposals that have not yet been made with the SPD : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wants to stop sympathy for terror groups under punishment and jihadi@@ st with double citizenship to the German passport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cle@@ ars the CDU man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he still hold this for reasonable and challenging , whatever the coalition partner doesn &apos;t have any chances . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few new ideas will present de Mai@@ zi@@ ère .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are partly in themselves : he plans quick procedure for dep@@ ort@@ ations and more possibilities for detention of people before deportation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refugees who are targeted specifically into the country should checked out their smart phones and disc@@ lose social media accounts for security examination . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in case of di@@ oc@@ ations for exp@@ ired asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to put some more worse than so far - about those who commit crimes , or disc@@ lose their papers in order to wear their identity .
some of them is politically and legally sanc@@ tified .
man@@ ches also works un@@ balanced and leaves questions open .
and at some points - at the un@@ equal treatment of toler@@ ated for example - the question arises : what does it actually have to do with security and terror ?
yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the issues of refugees and terror .
but it cannot be said that the assass@@ inations of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were refugees .
in addition , many people are worried about the safety of the high refugee .
and things that people are deeply involved , did not cl@@ utter yourself in election hours .
the inner security is enormous in the focus .
first stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the pollution is great .
and yes , there are electoral fights .
Union and SPD are increasingly on the subject of internal security .
in the past days there went up between the two parties .
only a gar@@ st@@ ine argument about the decor of the federal police , then on a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons Interior Minister , in which the R@@ ess@@ or@@ ch@@ efs also urge a Bur@@ ka @-@ ban and a return from double citizenship .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère takes care of reconc@@ ile sounds here .
he doesn &apos;t keep anything from a return from the double pass .
we have satisfied the discussion in Germany .
they ane@@ w , don &apos;t be useful .
and with a Bur@@ ka @-@ prohibition it has un@@ constitutional concerns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if its own package is fixed on all corners , and if it actually is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reasonable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is for the coalition partner , it has to show itself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is a lot in what could provide for dispute .
but the SPD is also trying to pro@@ filing an internal security issue .
&quot; &quot; &quot; party manager Sig@@ mar Gabriel was first to talk to talks and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to the security further . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Volkswagen gli@@ ders still comes through .
despite diesel engines , deliveries worldwide rise worldwide .
but not in all markets it is running around .
in the recall reaction there is vor@@ tex around a term .
Volkswagen launches the deliveries in the second half of the year .
Europe &apos;s biggest car manufacturer can result in spite of its many brands and some well @-@ run markets , despite its many brands and some well @-@ moving markets .
but in July the core brand VW was weak@@ ened mainly in Western Europe and thus loads the total sale of companies shared by the D@@ ax .
in July , the VW brand sold 1.8 percent less vehicles worldwide than in the previous year .
in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below last year &apos;s month .
in the home market Germany , the deliveries are nearly a hex@@ agon .
brand management Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann led the weaker numbers from July , especially on two sales days less in Europe .
in addition to &quot; changed economic conditions &quot; in some core markets , it was given a department store .
in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote have reli@@ ed on the withdrawal from the EU , explained an spokesperson .
in the USA , where the exhaust gas is first escal@@ ated , there is also a min@@ us to be@@ ech .
large support for VW is the Chinese market .
all in all , the primarily affected house brand of the lower Lower Saxony is due : after the first seven months , only a delivery minus of 0.9 percent is limited to 3,@@ 37 million vehicles .
group sales by Fred Kap@@ pler was able to exhibit a sale in January to July .
Volkswagen generated 1.3 percent more vehicles in this period , 5.@@ 904 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had tam@@ pered with a software package .
in Germany alone , VW calls about 2.5 million cars to upgrade into the workshops .
in the course of retro@@ fitting , VW re@@ affir@@ med that the conversion of cars has no negative effects .
after retro@@ fitting the vehicles , there is no deteri@@ oration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine capacity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the car park of the customer after retro@@ fitting a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guaranteed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certificate from , but do not speak of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as it was on Friday in business trips . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reason are legal issues .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was reported , Volkswagen acknowledged its German customers now a guarantee for ger@@ ated diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was confirmed by VW representatives from the Federal Ministry of Transport on Monday .
the Ministry of Transport confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW designed the editions of my inquiry commission and the KBA customer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; variations of these are not accepted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , according to ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
VW has adopted the guarantee that in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions , or motor power after retro@@ fitting no deteri@@ or@@ ations will take place and all the typ@@ ing relevant vehicle values remain unchanged .
Volkswagen itself does not use the term &quot; guarantee &quot; but not as it was in business trips .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the wide term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warranty &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers come back for example half a year after the conversion , which could lead to a workshop - and this will lead to the new software even if the damage has nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also important to avoid that in case of any other damage it is possible to do anything with the waste sc@@ andal , which comes to a certainty concerning the potential warranty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , VW is using the term &quot; guarantee &quot; not .
Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ enb@@ ank G@@ mund at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands from rich austerity in the future - as a second Institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; ban@@ quet Josef Paul said on Thursday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It &apos;s only about 139 customers to park the 40 million euros on g@@ ro@@ - or daily monetary accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Federal Association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German B@@ anks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speaks of a single failure and does not see it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normal austerity would not be afraid to pay for their austerity measures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
store money over night in the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay 0.4 per cent pen@@ alties .
this charge will charge Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ enb@@ ank G@@ mund from September by private and corporate clients for deposits of EUR 100,000 on g@@ ro@@ - or daily monetary accounts .
&quot; the first 100.000 people are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 costs will be € 400 in the year , &quot; said Paul .
he has been spending 40 million euros by a day that could be with@@ drawn from one day on the others , and he could not be measured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are at the central bank account and generate 0.4 per cent costs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the banking owner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I cannot lay 4000 Euros for any million . &quot;
the costs will now yield further after the caus@@ ation principle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cash is easy to leave in the v@@ ault of Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ enb@@ ank , would be much too dangerous : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve seen four fail@@ ures , I am not even the fifth ! &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the Board of Directors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
most clients have had understanding and changed to other investment forms .
few mig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bavaria declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy course causes considerable costs in all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they alone bear to wear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; farm economic not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account management , credit cards or transfers .
the Thur@@ ing@@ ian national and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ enb@@ ank Al@@ ten@@ burger was made head@@ lines in 2014 with pen@@ al courses for deposits from three million euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , CEO of the banking association , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are not expecting to pay private clients nationwide loss for deposits , the competition in Germany among banks and savings banks is much too strong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a ban@@ ker said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see , there is a cli@@ ent@@ ele that is fully equipped with fortune . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can be a problem for a small bank &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; if it is free of charge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the G@@ mund founded in 1911 has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , R@@ ott@@ ach Mountains , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .
in the region , well @-@ known actors , sport@@ s@@ men and entrepren@@ eurs live .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association of Bavaria &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are currently not known to further banks who charge a storage set for deposits of private customers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said spokesperson Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the President of the Federal Federation of German People &apos;s People and Rai@@ ff@@ eisen Bank ( BvR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , declared at the end of June : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the threshold , to go to the negative , is very , very high . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
competition is hard , and it threat@@ ens immigration to competition .
customers in Germany do not have fallen in width .
destination plat@@ ters : who are actually buying records ?
lonely men &apos;s middle age love records .
before you rush to comment in order to over@@ sow@@ ed it under the pseud@@ onym of non @-@ alle@@ vi@@ ation age , this statement is derived from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the widely spoken re@@ generation of records is not due to a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als that would like to welcome the news of physical objects but in Mid@@ life @-@ nost@@ algia .
those who have bought a record recently , are all lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood according to the age between 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most likely number of buyers .
it is also not a hor@@ ror by Hob@@ bies - it has an emotional meaning : older turn@@ around kept their feelings rather for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy it alone to spend time ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but are the results of You@@ go@@ v ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; if this blog would be a news report on TV , I &apos;d pass the camera during a busy road in S@@ oh@@ o , a modest ho@@ e suit , before I keep standing , my hands hold and somewhat am@@ big@@ u@@ ity as : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so let &apos;s take a close look at it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , let &apos;s take a look at it .
even though the Heart So@@ hos moves slowly to its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill up the buildings where once independent seller were based - there are still a hand@@ ful of fantastic record shops .
I would probably ask the c@@ amer@@ aman to disable the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind through observation .
Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , whom I went from sister Ray ( number of : two young women , three men middle age ) into Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( data number : eight men &apos;s middle age , a woman , probably around the 20 ) , is a day long because of a meeting in London and walks through the shops to fill some hours .
is he a collector , I wonder ?
&quot; I guess , &quot; he says .
I have about 3,000 or 4.000 plates .
this records , pictured above ( he sent me the snap@@ shot by e @-@ mail , I &apos;m not following him ) , dress the walls of his living room .
the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles , is the result of its available income : he is now able to buy records , which he could not afford to buy , when he sold , when he was young and ple@@ ite .
&quot; many things I buy , are out of the late 60s , early &apos; 70s , which appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I thought to have something too young to buy them , &quot; he says .
he agre@@ es to those who buy records , rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and happily spend alone time , and add : &quot; I smoke not and I don &apos;t drink much .
this is my truck .
WE@@ Z , 25 who works with Sister Ray , also believes that many customers who meets the You@@ go@@ v profile .
however , he has noticed a new wave of people who have influenced by the media , people who have heard about com@@ eback and get started to buy their old records .
of the convers@@ ations I have led , people usually have been dra@@ fted into their collection by 1998 or 1999 .
customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records , &quot; he says .
this would explain the boom to tra@@ ilers of a particular age .
but what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates ?
it takes only a few seconds in a shop like phon@@ ica in order to recognize that record shops offers a so@@ othing community of equality .
according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers participated in the cont@@ act@@ less payment system .
some record fans are overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to cover the stability of familiar sound @-@ pl@@ aten , from objects that watch happy ju@@ gen@@ der@@ ings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think sometimes it can be the col@@ t of a void or possession of material poss@@ essions than a kind of consol@@ ation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said WE@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a collector , so I think it is so many people .
it is a simple way to deal with spiritu@@ ally .
&quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; fl@@ utes a staff from a turn@@ out stack .
a survey of IC@@ M revealed in April that almost 50 % of the people who bought a record last month they haven &apos;t listened .
the survey also found that 41 % have a record player , whom they never use while 7 % of those who buy a plate , don &apos;t have a record player .
at this time of the news report I would probably look very worried , while I leaf@@ lets through a stack of Bos@@ sa Nova comp@@ il@@ ations .
J@@ onny , 42 , who works at sounds of the Universe ( data : three men middle aged ) has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; of the Revi@@ val .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; someone came in only here and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no record player , but I would like to buy a radio record , so that I can put them in the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a great percentage , but it definitely happens .
more product heavy , less playing music .
we have people who say : &quot; I have no turn@@ tables . &quot;
these are younger people , not older who come out slowly .
so F@@ opp , who has dedicated the sound@@ board almost a whole floor , has a little audience than I pu@@ rest .
there are couples around 70 , tourists who make photos , Teen@@ agers and women &apos;s middle age .
even though the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts of latest syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and expert pop instead of experimental jazz dr@@ y@@ fish from the loud@@ speakers - it is good to see such diversity among customers .
none of them looks very lonely , but brand psych@@ ic trau@@ mat@@ a are difficult to determine when one stands next to somebody for 30 seconds .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , runs around in the business for several minutes and considers the variety of the panels available for sale .
it rather makes a shop bum@@ per than a big purchase .
she doesn &apos;t deserve a lot , so collecting boards cannot be real option , she says .
it costs a lot .
it is easy to listen to music from a computer or in other way , but the beauty of records is ... &quot; it drives with a scor@@ ching si@@ gh .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record @-@ lovers : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
while I admit the ticket , the je@@ ans hot@@ ter , I observe a group of young teen@@ ager people who want to group for a moment around pol@@ aro@@ id cameras , before a father and his daughter is superior to buy a Cro@@ sley turn@@ tables .
on the left there is a stair@@ case , a wall full of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , Amy Win@@ eh@@ ouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mix of contemporary music and classics , the essential boards for an average collection .
no one sees them - maybe because they are purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch it .
it is pure &quot; record art . &quot;
but considering the fact that every attraction for these items mean more money for the industry and could send some customers to the depths of So@@ hos to more , there is nothing to complain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money as others , even that is the most important for luxury objects like boards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even if my research fellow would agree that the results of You@@ go@@ v , leave them , at least in record shops in S@@ oh@@ o , which exist in reality , record shops and in On@@ line@@ for@@ en , not considered .
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .
they spend their Thursday morning with safety , not with the stroll through the bum@@ ps of the Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves by plates , while they master the un@@ c@@ anny eye of a ha@@ unted , 30 @-@ year @-@ old moder@@ ator s@@ cour@@ aged over the shoulders of nothing .

French Court re@@ jects offer on demol@@ ition of shops in the jungle refugee camp
a French Court refused an offer of authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , in which thousands of refugees live , re@@ vo@@ iced .
during a court hearing this week argu@@ ed by the authorities in Cal@@ ais that the state should be fu@@ elled to sell , 72 temporary shops , selling cigarettes to energy drinks , selling hair services or tea for 50 cents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants .
the pre@@ fecture of Cal@@ ais argu@@ ed that these places should be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy , of which no taxes would be paid , resulting in a fire and nature reserve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanitarian groups shared the court that businesses and restaurants are important as the free meals that were offered by the nation@@ ally supported association and other groups , not sufficient food for the growing numbers in the camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , they carried out that the temporary shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a court in L@@ ille decided that there were no legal basis for the assignment of people who run the 72 temporary shops , but cle@@ ars that the concerns of the pre@@ fecture of Cal@@ ais &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is absolutely trace@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that food stores , cafes , and restaurants would play a lot more important than people who live &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; live in extremely pre@@ valent conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that the areas are in a quiet meeting between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places , which was threatened by the rainf@@ alls , was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café of the camp , the non @-@ profit organization and 200 meals a day , English and French classes , as well as a advice about asylum seek@@ ers who offers un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0,000 people signed the pet@@ ition to keep the Kids &apos; Café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it was said that the closure is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these children of a catastrophe , of which the youngest eight years are old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two aid organisations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants have increased to over 9@@ ,000 people in the jungle - the highest number till now - after a steep increase of new@@ com@@ ers during the summer .

he didn &apos;t have any explanation for his mis@@ erable twel@@ f@@ th place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hon@@ est@@ ly say it &apos;s difficult to comment on yesterday &apos;s time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he must analyse things in peace , which could have caused reasons for de@@ bac@@ le .
at the time of the World Cup in October in Qatar , Martin wanted to fight for the title .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will see everything that we have changed in recent times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Be@@ am went on with its offer only in January to start and has already more than 100,000 users .

here comes the En@@ forcement trailer
Germany &apos;s shaving need to set itself on the next generation of speed@@ ometers : in various federal states , among others in H@@ esse and Brandenburg , new flas@@ hes are tested , which should effectively carry out Tem@@ pos@@ ana .
the futur@@ istic @-@ acting En@@ forcement trailer of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example of accidents , where it would be dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
for example , on motorway buildings or to sandy bridges , with temporary Tem@@ ples , there are often no necessary infrastructure to ensure compliance with a stationary bl@@ ater for adher@@ ence to speed limit@@ ing .
a lasting mobile device can be too dangerous or costly .
the En@@ forcement trailer is aut@@ ark : its battery resi@@ sts in continuous measuring operation five days , the case data is encrypted via a modem .
with laser measuring technology , all vehicles can also be recorded via several tracks .
variable speed limit@@ ing as well as penetration after time , vehicle strips and vehicle class can also be monitored .
you can move the trailer with trailer hit@@ ch with trailer hit@@ ch in the highly ge@@ ared state .
so that he is not simply plugged in , it is lowered in the measuring mode so that the wheels in the pan@@ eled and also qu@@ ett@@ led outer cover disappear .
in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the gl@@ itter from v@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested by Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and is now also used .
even foreign authorities bl@@ ends with the new technology : recently France has arranged 100 pieces after an order of 150 pieces last year .
great Britain covers silver in 7 @-@ er Rug@@ by after Fiji Master@@ class Gold
the impressive performance in Britain during the 7 @-@ year ru@@ g@@ by came to a rup@@ tly stop in the final hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is when they were defeated at a result of 43 @-@ 7 in the De@@ od@@ oro Stadium here in Rio .
Fiji best@@ owed a master class in the handling , side @-@ step@@ ping , back@@ rest , line and ro@@ uting strength to win gold - their first Olympic champion of any color .
the defeat was won by the not too bad tro@@ phy of the silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth day - and they could be very proud of their efforts in that tournament in which they struck New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the clear defeat of the bu@@ cks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ final on the same day could fall on them in the final .
but on this form , Fiji had put a 15 @-@ man team in top shape in this form .
it could be a consol@@ ation for GB - but it is probably not - that at least one Br@@ it tomorrow will have a gold medal around his neck tomorrow : Fi@@ j@@ is Head trainer Ben Ryan , the former chief of England from Wim@@ ble@@ don .
GB had a difficult way behind .
eight years ago , they are lost under Ryan every game with the Adelaide Sev@@ ens .
here it is just one .
this stage will hurt , but progress is amazing .
Fiji began wonder@@ full and let the GB@@ s come out of fun .
it felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co . an , one would run in driving buses . the World Series winner went 5 @-@ 0 to the top , as O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au near the corner .
with four minutes of play , Jerry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack on the right corner , which he walked .
12 @-@ 0 and GB barely picked up the ball .
a he@@ avi@@ ary valley from Mitchell stopped the mountain of Sierra Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa got a third gate , but it only got up on Fiji .
in the seventh minute J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a in the right corner reaches a touch down and it stand 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new one since the resur@@ rec@@ y and there was still more than a minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u prec@@ eded by further weak Tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB Team and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to the break .
it is as if Fiji was born to play the 7 , while GB still appro@@ ves .
it is that way .
GB introduced basic changes to half @-@ time and concluded the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for whole four minutes which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time , until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova went through to a brilliant interim play of Fiji .
Dan N@@ ort@@ on started an attempt on GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game was already long in favour of the South @-@ cat@@ ar@@ ists whose fans sang , flags flying , and danced on the tri@@ b@@ une .
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame made the i @-@ bag with another attempt in the last seconds .
the fi@@ ff rang out , the fi@@ j@@ is hu@@ gged and the GB scra@@ ped down in the grass .
early on the day Fiji Japan had conquered Japan in semi@@ finals with 20 @-@ 5 defeat and Britain displac@@ ed South Africa in a s@@ nap @-@ fin@@ al@@ match from the race - Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the bu@@ cks in the first half , but Dan N@@ ort@@ on broke through the line with an impressive foot work and scored a gate under the post in the second half .
a brilli@@ antly late Tac@@ kling Marcus Watson , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ seaside team secured the win - and thus the silver medal .
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by fighting with the cancer of the Train@@ ers
there will be no greater the engine of gold than those games and that wants to be called .
from the first stro@@ kes to the last , 220 hard h@@ ie@@ ve , who found in history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an extra meaning in their golden moment on Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even if there were only those who sat at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . the Echo of the trainer Robin Williams , was all@@ present to the second Olympic champion in a row without tax woman , the first women in the history of British Sports , which put on such a scale .
their domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all of her 3@@ 9.@@ 8 un@@ armed action , which is also un@@ parall@@ eled .
what we see are two brilliant athl@@ ets that gli@@ des over the surface with the elegance of pigs , which is not reflected by the art of the Tri@@ umph@@ al Arch .
behind every gold in the rowing , a batt@@ ali@@ on is to contribute to the incre@@ mental progress , which make the difference and it was no one more comfortable than the coach who would not survive this day when he was diagnosed with cancer .
as he said , he ris@@ eth what ris@@ ky .
I had bladder cancer , which is oper@@ able and they did .
if you do not , it spreads everywhere .
it would have been quite a bad situation .
it changes a bit the view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio were lucky that he could be the treatment of early 2014 , out of season , could begin what the inter@@ ruption kept to a minimum if this is at all the correct term in such circumstances .
I needed money , so it soon had to go better again soon .
it was an inc@@ en@@ tive .
I was in the hospital and ran around at the station - 20 feet , 30 foot , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough .
so it begins .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rowing on itself is already a challenge , but that makes it a bigger one . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the in@@ convenience of victory their first thoughts became Williams , who spent a ner@@ ven@@ ous morning so much more than otherwise to speak and tried to process his own fears . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ anning , who was called Captain in the Royal Art@@ illery regim@@ ent in Afghanistan , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was this week an emotional wreck . that &apos;s perhaps a bit extreme , but it means so much . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is only what it means to me , how much I and Helen and also Robin worked .
there were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
without Robin , we wouldn &apos;t be a massive thanks to him . he is the best coach of the world .
I wouldn &apos;t have a better person to trainer or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning lost no race in the last five years .
the pair had a hard rhythm , with which their opponents couldn &apos;t keep up .
even in the last 500 meters , when the teams started from New Zealand and Denmark , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much to reserve .
we were very imprisoned at the moment .
Helen called &quot; stay in the process , remain in the process . &quot;
it is really important to let not get involved .
we had a good start and at the same time we weren &apos;t looking forward to doing something ra@@ bies .
we wanted no fireworks today , we just wanted to achieve a good result , go out and win the race , what we did .
the couple will take a year for a year before making decisions about his future .
Glo@@ ver has to appear next week on a wedding , their own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall .
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want that my last race was .
that would have much pressure .
in London it took about six months to realize that I am a Olympics .
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
here it took about four minutes .
that feels so much better , &quot; she said .
for 31 years , exemplary for clarity
the managing director of the &quot; V@@ eit@@ z Group , &quot; R@@ upper@@ t G@@ öller , retired .
the association is regarded as &quot; Bavarian &quot; exemplary . &quot;
a small folding drinking water association as a model for the great water producers .
so it was a time ago in the original article at the Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk , some time ago .
a little later , the water forum of the government of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia informed the purpose of the two @-@ ties .
the labor of the file group &quot; Bavarian far as exemplary . &quot;
behind this is Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who was 31 years in the twin team , 28 years as managing director .
he was now reti@@ ring at the age of 65 .
the pot@@ able water purpose association of the V@@ eit@@ ere group , based in K@@ ott@@ endorf , municipality of Breit@@ brun@@ n , promotes about 15@@ 0000 cubic meters of water and provides 32 locations and ham@@ let with about 5@@ 500 inhabitants .
member communities are the churches of Kirch@@ heim , Breit@@ brun@@ n , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the city of B@@ aun@@ ach .
for further towns and mun@@ icipalities there are water supplies .
the current chairman , Breit@@ brun@@ ns mayor in Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( FW ) , re@@ minded that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was hired as a water go@@ al@@ keeper in 1985 and has been appointed CEO of the purpose @-@ association in 1988 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his duties have been very diverse and they have been sc@@ ary from water management and maintenance activities , budget planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emergen@@ cies , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the chair@@ person . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as outstanding events , she called the commissioning and inauguration of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , property purchases in the field of new foun@@ tains ( 1998 ) and compensation of farmers , the renovation of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the re@@ generation of water pipes .
there was no lac@@ tation at all , and I &apos;ve always accepted changes because water is means of water and drinking water the most important food .
in her integrity , she praised G@@ öl@@ ler faithful , reliable and correct service over 31 years .
he used himself with a lot of heart blood for its water purpose and he used the water @-@ purpose association as if it would be his own company .
a few weeks ago , he is present as a real pract@@ iti@@ oner to the success of the V@@ eit@@ z group for the nit@@ rate of nit@@ rate in front of the Wasser@@ forum of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia .
for that he received very much recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öller served Al@@ f@@ ons Grie@@ bel who joined him for 28 years with him .
he is the best water go@@ al@@ keeper and he was a loyal f@@ lap .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as highlights from its view@@ point he marked the Brun@@ nen@@ enbau and the restructuring of the purpose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest challenge and the most difficult deployment were the flood on the high reservoir at Kirch@@ heim on a 3rd of January . &quot; &quot; &quot;
here we had to work at minus 17 degrees the whole night , so the sett@@ lements with water could be supplied .
even the supply of Neu@@ brun@@ n can only be maintained once , because you filled the high container of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses .
the management of the drinking water terminal was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter , who enters the succession of Ru@@ pert G@@ öller .

a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man was shot in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ te@@ hei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on Friday and she was wounded in his partner country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man called himself to us and given to have shot his partner for his life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police woman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpet@@ rators be on the run , and it will be fired publicly .
meanwhile , Sven S. could be on the way by car .
the man is about 1.@@ 80 meters large , muscular , brown , and has a smooth .
meanwhile the police published a photo of him .
it is a few years old .
meanwhile , the man we@@ ars a gl@@ aze .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still contribute the weapon , so the police .
if you see Sven S. , the 110 is calling .
the police talks about a &quot; Association of Association . &quot;
the victim was born in 1988 , the perpet@@ rator in 1981 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the competent police in Lübeck did not want to do any data to the public or the relationship between the perpet@@ rators and the relationship between perpet@@ rators and victims , but confirmed that a man had been killed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is a killing deli@@ kt . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t say more at the moment , &quot; said a police woman in Lübeck .
e@@ ye@@ witnesses are according to a special work command ( SEK ) at the crime scene .

financial bur@@ dens that threatened the industry from the cost @-@ electricity promotion , are from the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the liberation from the renewable energy industry , the Federal Minister of Economics in the German steel industry said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West German General Newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Fre@@ it@@ ag@@ Edition ) &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m really happy that we could finally arrive after two years of tough negotiations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission initially planned to use the steel manufacturers that use gases coming from the blast furnace for electricity generation for their own consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the German industry association , the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , now an agreement with the EU Commission for talks with competition Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only when generators are replaced in steel works , an EEG lev@@ elling of 20 percent .
but also this won &apos;t be raised in the steel industry .
the IG Metall welcomed the agreement of Germany with the European Commission for its own production .
thus the status quo of the current regulation will largely be established .
special meaning have the successful artwork of Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &apos; steel , the future &apos; is the first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; more must follow . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; IG Metall manager Jörg Hofmann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; announced &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; announced in Frankfurt to reform the issue of emission . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has been suffering from over@@ capacities and a substantial pricing pressure since the financial crisis of 2008 .
last year , the situation intensi@@ fied , as the world &apos;s largest producer in China cast down steel onto the global market in view of the vulner@@ able domestic demand .
European manufacturers throw Chinese steel concerts at a price d@@ umping .
during this spring the situation has somewhat relaxed .
to show a suspended in@@ lay oil on imported steel effect , the other economic prospects for China have raised in China .
it is un@@ clear how sustainable the price recovery is .
the German industry pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp remained c@@ auti@@ ous on Thursday .
the prices had been stag@@ nat@@ ing again .
the industry re@@ acts to the difficult situation with further costs .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp also did not want to exclu@@ de closure of individual works .
at the end of 2015 , around 8@@ 6000 people were employed in the German steel industry .
in July , German steel manufacturers remain careful in spite of increasing prices and increasing orders .
they produced a good six percent less cru@@ de steel by 3.4 million tonnes , compared to the previous year &apos;s economic association , on Friday .
after a short increase in May , the produced quantity went back to the second month in a row .
since the beginning of the year , production has been increased by two percent below the previous year .
the association expects an improved volume in the coming months thanks to an improved order volume .
community , Spirit , health : singing ad@@ ores good
the singing has accompanied Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp already their whole life : as young girl she was in the choir , in the teaching position she took the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a sen@@ iors chor@@ us .
&quot; I &apos;m moving - emotional and physical , &quot; she describes .
after a rehear@@ sal she feels more balanced , cheerful and more lively , she says .
by the way , she does something good in their health and mind .
for singing is a great hobby for sen@@ iors , says Erhard H@@ ackl@@ es from the German veter@@ an liga .
most sen@@ iors sing in the chor@@ us and sharing with equ@@ ines the joy of music , H@@ ackl@@ er describes .
the regular co@@ hes@@ ion can establish and maintain sen@@ iors social contacts .
for frequent , social and family structures in old age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this experience also made the Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her chor@@ us : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to speak and organize to meet the others and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of collective consciousness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
singing can be st@@ ress@@ ful in the positive sense , writes h@@ ic@@ cups .
for this sen@@ iors train a deep and controlled breathing .
whoever ur@@ ges his lungs regularly , is not as fast as the pu@@ rest in everyday life .
even if it comes to get the sound of the voice in old age , singing is an optimal hobby .
in addition to older people , singing often has a very special effect , Ursula L@@ enz says of the Federal Labour Community of Senior Citi@@ zens .
in the previous generations , joint singing had a much higher job value , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and in leisure time , she explains .
L@@ enz frequently ob@@ serves that singing or listening of songs are ar@@ ous@@ ed with older people , often associated with positive feelings of their youth .
by lyrics and especially melodies , people are hur@@ rying to oppos@@ e people in long past events .
when singing , the head also requires a special power , L@@ enz explains .
at the same time to concentrate on their own voice and to adapt to a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge .
just older people who live alone , practice not only to concentrate on yourself .
another positive aspect is the recognition that one drives through singing in the choir , H@@ ackl@@ es means .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ este@@ em is also growing by singing in a choir .
to show yourself : if I am long for something , I will get better and watch over me - this experience strength@@ ens .
good reasons to begin with singing , so there is enough .
who wants to try a new hobby , should not hesitate - even if he means to have little talent , L@@ enz reveals .
you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 singing people who are listening to it when a sound is next ?
looking for a suitable offer , sen@@ iors have different ways , says H@@ ackl@@ er .
if someone is singing from a friend in a senior town , you can simply join .
many cities also offer over@@ views over the cho@@ irs in the surrounding area .
those who want to sing in a church choir can turn right to the church or the Church .
many veter@@ an cho@@ irs will also be found via the internet .
anyone who has no access to the Internet can ask family , friends or neighbors for the help of Internet booking .
those who desire to sing , should definitely join a choir , reveals h@@ ic@@ cups .
singing does good and has something liber@@ ating - this is true for every age .
cats react sensitive as a cr@@ ater on scre@@ ams of the young animals
biolog@@ ists have examined in Hanover on which effect the calls of cat@@ ch@@ enb@@ ys has grown on adult animals .
in their surprise , the male also didn &apos;t let the males cold - however , they always stopped in the difference to the females .
female cats can recognize the ri@@ val@@ ence of cat@@ ch@@ enb@@ ru@@ ys at the bottom of the little ones .
they react ten percent faster on Lau@@ te of K@@ ittens who are in great distress , as scientists from the veter@@ inary Academy and the Hannover Medical University ( MH@@ H ) .
males also react to the calls of K@@ ittens - however always the same .
&quot; obviously , the acoustic differences between the che@@ wing of less and strongly inherited young animals are either not perc@@ ei@@ vable or not of importance , &quot; said Bi@@ olog@@ in Wie@@ b@@ ke Con@@ er@@ ding of the MH@@ H .
she is the first author of the study published on this Friday in the journal &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology . &quot;
in a previous test , the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the k@@ ittens scre@@ ams was differenti@@ ated with the ur@@ gency of their help needs .
a total of nine adult males and eight k@@ kers were observed from the animal hus@@ band@@ ages .
they were played for a call of little ones , taken for three minutes from the throwing box and separated from the mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
on the other hand , they were confron@@ ted with scre@@ aming of stronger k@@ ittens who were additionally lifted .
the researchers observe their results despite the low sample for meaningful use .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the females , even those who had no own offspring , responded to the cri@@ es , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they turned fast to the loudspeaker when this calls played a very experienced k@@ ittens .
this ability might be born or develop with the sexually mature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a surprise that the males have re@@ acted at all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Bi@@ ologist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past scientists have already studied the reactions of women and men on baby sounds .
some studies showed that women were sensitive to infants , as if they were already mothers or not , the Bi@@ olog@@ in Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported .
Po@@ dol@@ ski attacks with &quot; Gala &quot; to Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ kü@@ r is a football @-@ legend in Turkey .
Turkey has been issued an arrest warrant against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ r .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
for the first time after the coup attempt in Turkey , Turkey is again an important football game .
before the du@@ el of the arch@@ rival between Bes@@ ik@@ tas Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ skis Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul is the official line clearly : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced .
already on the suspension of the emergency test after the overthrow in July , the government , the daily routine of norm@@ ality should not be imp@@ aired .
but this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len movement , which is responsible for the attempt attempt .
the football is not made before the football .
he issued an arrest warrant against the former Star@@ k@@ icker Hak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ r .
therefore , in America he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
Sü@@ iled shall be the follow@@ er of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len to be responsible for the coup attempt by the President Recep Tayyip Erdogan .
although the exceptional state was initially planned for 90 days until October , in fact , this has actually been the life of most Turks , but as good as no implic@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the no@@ c@@ tur@@ nal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy guards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in public places throughout the country has declared Erdogan on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is - like all the country - split in followers and opponent Erd@@ og@@ ans .
especially fans of workers &quot; clubs are traditionally not among the friends of the President .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in view of dramatic experiences in history , the strict re@@ jection of military coup is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; military coup &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the fans agree - whether their heart beats at Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
at Pok@@ al@@ si@@ eger &quot; Gala , &quot; we will definitely come back to Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski .
the Cologne set its sporty value in the past season : with 17 gates and nine templates , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old completed his first playing time as a Top@@ sc@@ orer of his club .
in the final game of Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce he scored 1 : 0 @-@ Sieg@@ tre@@ ffer .
the newspaper &quot; fan@@ atics &quot; shou@@ ted him : &quot; he was the best in place . &quot;
he has completed the season on an outstanding way and his team secured the cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thanks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the disappoin@@ ting season took place for the record master . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the Vor@@ round @-@ K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also ends early in the Europa League . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Sü@@ per Li@@ g there was only rank six .
the season was not good .
the Pok@@ al was the only way to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we made it and that &apos;s the most important thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the game year was better for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
above all , thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who took up the basis of 26 season levels as Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ go@@ protective sa@@ unas as the basis of the 14th title .
this is also the reason that the fans hope to return to the return of the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , the AC Florence had declared a contract under contract and posted only out@@ l@@ ent Gom@@ ez , after the coup attempt &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because of the political situation in the country , after his EM @-@ vacation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he must just say it , &quot; cited the journal &quot; K@@ icker &quot; Club Director F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so the storms should be willing to aband@@ on some one @-@ third of his to 7.5 million euros an estimated annual sal@@ aries , Or@@ man is clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can &apos;t pay his salary in Florence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite D@@ oping : these athletes still have medals for Olympics in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Justin Gat@@ lin was already locked twice for d@@ oping ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ owa must not start in Rio .
other athle@@ tics sinners can only laugh about it - they are fighting in Rio by medals .
the topic D@@ oping determines the head@@ lines from the Rio Olympics in Rio .
the Russian s@@ wimm@@ ers of Juli@@ ja Jef@@ im@@ owa , who compl@@ ained after playing a d@@ oping @-@ lock just before the games , was un@@ riv@@ alled and hat@@ eful at its start ( 100 meters chest ) .
the scene offered itself : with a set smile she was still proud in the hall and prov@@ oked her appearance .
when she was understood that she won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke out in a thunder@@ storm .
but there are many other sport@@ s@@ men that go to the start despite d@@ oping past at the Rio Olympics .
here is an overview :
Justin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Season / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics .
it was closed for two times due to d@@ oping ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
since its spell , the Olympic champion of 2004 and ex @-@ world champion is even faster than ever , it is over 100 m in 9,@@ 80 seconds the number one in the world and is considered to be the biggest challenge of Us@@ ain Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Season / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven times world champion had to sit in 2010 after taking the loss of pain using Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don .
after surgery had had severe gum disease , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended .
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Dis@@ cus / Croatia ) : 2011 , the Olympic champion of 2012 , world champion of 2013 and European Championship was tested positively on the prohibited stim@@ ulator @-@ agent meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ ag@@ amine .
Per@@ kovic denied the know@@ ingly in@@ gest@@ ion and was closed for six months .
the four broad@@ est th@@ rows this year go to the account of the great gold@@ favour@@ ites .
La@@ Shawn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 m s@@ quad@@ ron / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic champion and two @-@ time world champion over 400 m , was tested positively and had been closed for 21 months in 2010 .
a remedy for penis enlargement has been responsible , dev@@ il@@ ated Mer@@ ritt .
this year the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is over 200 and 400 m of the world &apos;s fastest growing man .
Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer@@ ing , Belarus ) : hardly any athl@@ ets were subsequently detected as many medals .
T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title in 2005 nine years later , after being diagnosed with him testosterone d@@ oping .
the now 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to deliver the Olympic @-@ silver 2004 because of ster@@ oid d@@ oping and the EM title 2006 because of testosterone abuse .
he also received the recognised bronze medal at the 2008 Olympic Games in 2008 due to a decision of the International Criminal Tribunal .
at 8@@ 0,@@ 04 m , he sits in place two of the world ranking .
Liu Hong ( 20 km walk , China ) : the world record student and Gold@@ favor@@ it@@ in was first tested in May , but may still be started in Rio .
in the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world champion , references to the in@@ gest@@ ed dietary supplement has been found , the lock of the world anti @-@ d@@ oping agency WA@@ DA fell mild and ran off on 13 July .
Bom@@ b@@ enter@@ ror in Thailand - Austrian viol@@ ates - Sever@@ al deaths
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman , said the spokes@@ man of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Fre@@ it@@ ag@@ early .
they had suffered and had been treated in the hospital , but I have already left this hospital .
her hom@@ ebo@@ und journey is planned for early September .
whether from other explo@@ sions on holiday island Ph@@ u@@ ket and in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ umph@@ on are also affected by Austrian citizens , be still un@@ clear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will stand in a constant contact with the local authorities , so Schn@@ ö@@ ll . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the approximately 200 kilometres south of the capital of Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in was initially explo@@ ded on Thursday evening in a quarter of two bombs .
according to the police , a Tha@@ il@@ change killed and about 20 people were injured , including Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans .
Fre@@ it@@ ag@@ early then went back two fuel sets , and another human being killed , according to authorities .
also Ph@@ u@@ ket was reported in the morning a bomb explosion .
in the det@@ onation near the popular bathing beach of Ba@@ ong , Pat@@ ong was inj@@ ected with a taxi driver .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ east coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded , which killed an urban population .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bomb cor@@ set aside from the authorities in a flower bed in front of the territory of the territory . &quot; &quot; &quot;
finally det@@ on@@ ations required in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south west coast as well as in Ch@@ umph@@ on on the Southeast Coast of several injured .
one comes from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , named it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bomb attacks carry the same manuscript , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said armies of Dan@@ ai Krit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Fre@@ it@@ ag@@ early in front of journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume that it is a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is too early to express yourself to possible mot@@ if@@ s - probably I handle the actions of Muslim rebels .
Thai media also wanted to identify a pattern of the attacks , which is typical for the bombing of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
the Thai police , on the other hand , declared the assass@@ inations in connection with the Islam@@ ist movement or with international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local sab@@ otage that restricted to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rather it is aware that the bombs have been placed by opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta .
authorities have received sec@@ rec@@ tions on upcoming attacks in the south of the country last days - but they don &apos;t have been informed about the exact dates and places .
it is still un@@ clear what a group behind the attacks .
the police presented their civil servants throughout the country to rein@@ force security around major government building as well as airports , railway stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and am@@ us@@ ement stations .
there are always smaller bom@@ b@@ ings in Thailand , but they usually do not judge for tourists .
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace built over the year of Tha@@ il@@ ands King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
after the reason of reason of bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends to ensure the instructions given by Thai security authorities .
high security risk ( level 3 ) suffered for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ iw@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani , and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah Vi@@ per and its surroundings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after disputes between security forces and Muslim popul@@ ations , there will not be necessary traveling in these provinces . &quot; &quot; &quot;
increased risk of security ( security level 2 ) for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday were made a few days after a controversial referendum on one of the Constitution .
this cle@@ ars to the military great impact also in the years to come .
the jun@@ ta boss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Chan @-@ o @-@ cha said that the bombs have been an attempt to prevent chaos , while the country towards stability , an improvement of economic situation and tourism .
the military un@@ ta , which took power in 2014 after a phase of bloody un@@ rest , holds itself too good to have led the kingdom back to stability and order .
however , the military has not managed to get a grip for the military in the extreme south of the country since years in the extreme south of the country .
more than 6@@ 500 people were killed in the conflict .
nearly one year ago , in Bangkok at an attack on a popular Hindu shr@@ ine , 20 people were killed - most of them were foreign tourists .
it was the most bloody attack in the country &apos;s recent history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ident@@ ities movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has become the visor of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after several offices , the const@@ itu@@ tion@@ eer are also under observation of the group under observation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the &apos; Ident@@ itarian Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Constitutional Court Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate of the German Press Agency in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , migrants are diff@@ used by Islamic faith or the Middle East in extrem@@ ist manner .
therefore we observe the movement as well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ident@@ ities movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots that has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she turns against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mul@@ tik@@ ult@@ i @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; loss of own identity by over@@ alien@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Constitutional authority in nine Länder - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Wu@@ er@@ ttemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thur@@ ing@@ ia - observe the &quot; ident@@ ities &quot; already .
Ma@@ ate said , his authority were closely coordinated with the offices of the country .
&quot; groups like the &apos; ident@@ itarian movement &apos; try to pick up their target audience , where it stands , &quot; said the Constitutional Court .
in general , extrem@@ ists try to address them with you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music .
the Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing trem@@ ors .
this is not a temporary advertising for your own thing .
propaganda must pron@@ ounce the people emotion@@ ally .
young people are due in a special way .
this is dangerous .
at last , it had given reports from several German federal states to establish contacts of the &quot; ident@@ ities &quot; at AF@@ D @-@ politicians .
Ma@@ ate said that he had no knowledge .
for the constitutional protection , possible contacts of this species are only relevant from a certain point .
it depends on whether the party - in this case the AF@@ D - by certain individuals that are extrem@@ ist , the extreme direction is changing and so extrem@@ ist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , whether such people are tax@@ ing influence on the party . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not visible .
with a view to the significant increase in criminal off@@ ences and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and attacks , Ma@@ ate , he would not speak of new rights in this context .
but in recent years , we noted that there can be legitim@@ ate structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Fre@@ it@@ aler Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be quite well that further legal entities or small groups form to plan attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee or attacks from other right @-@ sex@@ ist motives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , a German @-@ wide or European control of legal terrorism should not be recogni@@ z@@ able .
the previous groups were created on the regional level or in social networks .
however , Ma@@ ate commented on that many attacks on the account of people who previously did not have occurred in the right scene in the early scene .
this is wor@@ rying .
many of the Tat@@ ars of attacks on asylum seek@@ ers were not previously known as crimin@@ als , politically motivated off@@ ences or followers of the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so many people have committed crimes who had previously voted with legal experts who were perhaps politically in@@ different or for example CDU , SPD or Lin@@ ke , who then have radic@@ alised himself by right @-@ wing political vocal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes the Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it
not always determine the Olympic Games or world records the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the bold appearance of RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te during the summer playing in Rio de Janeiro .
in the Aqu@@ atics Center , the lightly out@@ dated s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia is so slow that he could not see more in the TV pictures .
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the clip was selected .
in social networks , Hab@@ as@@ te became the viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old has ended its pre @-@ run back and finished the 5@@ 9th place of 59 star@@ ters .
but it was rather his not just sporting figure that drew attention to the international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old is participating in the Olympics ?
the Ethiop@@ ian group received a special start from the international life .
this will be distributed to make swimming in supported countries well @-@ known .
as in Ä@@ th@@ op@@ ia most sport@@ s@@ men run , Hab@@ te wanted to make something different .
preparation is all : RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te makes herself ready for the big race .
the first nick@@ names quickly made the round .
some media described him as &quot; RO@@ B@@ EL of the W@@ al . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; based on a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; welfare &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the English tab@@ loid The Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made it funny with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his time , he only struck with a minute and almost five seconds above the 100 meter Freestyle , since no role played .
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
during the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney , the run of Eric Mou@@ ss@@ am@@ ban@@ i took care of media attention .
unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pool from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea when he had to face over 100 metres of Freist@@ il alone .
Mou@@ ss@@ am@@ ban@@ i was fired at that time .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old began to swim eight months before Olympia and had never completed a long distance before the competition .

Tr@@ ump does not see the dro@@ oping election situation not so closely
the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump talks about a campaign event in Florida .
if there is nothing of choice to US president , Donald Tr@@ ump already has an alternative video .
he then desc@@ ends into the holiday .
if Donald Tr@@ ump loses US presidential elections in November , it doesn &apos;t matter : &quot; in the end , it would be either open , or I have a very , very nice holiday , &quot; said the candidate of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in a phone interview with the US television channel CN@@ BC .
if it is not enough for him at the end of the political correc@@ t@@ ness , it is fine , said Tr@@ ump .
thus he called the US president Barack Obama and the candidate of Democrats , Hillary Clinton , as the founder of the terrorist state ( IS ) .
in his party , more and more resistance was formed .
post is increasing in the trade with electro @-@ transport
an electric motor car of the German Post in Action .
the interest of other firms in the vehicle is apparently large .
the post is planning to sell their electric vehicle Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter .
shortly , the Group will start trade with the transporter .
the post will also offer its electric transporter from the upcoming year on the free motor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to go to third parties in the sale , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a post @-@ spokes@@ man on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company has been checking for months if they are designed to sell their self @-@ developed stre@@ et@@ sco@@ oter , with letters and pack@@ ets , also to sell to other establ@@ ishments .

Gf@@ K leadership joins disappoin@@ ting business numbers
the consumer research company Gf@@ K offers his boss Matthias Hartmann .
suddenly the set@@ tr@@ itte arrived suddenly - but not quite unexpected .
the difficult situation of the Gf@@ K &apos;s market research company Gf@@ K said that the chair of CEO Matthias Hartmann , the more uncertain won the success of his achievements .
turbul@@ ence at the top of Nuremberg &apos;s market research company Gf@@ K : once again disappoin@@ ting business figures and the resign@@ ation of the corporate leadership , the worldwide number five of the industry stands in front of a person@@ alized new beginning .
Gf@@ K Executive Board CEO wants to leave the company at the end of the year .
the Chairman of the Gf@@ K Supervisory Board in Arno already exp@@ elled from the supervisory board with effect from 12 September .
as of September 1 , the management of the Executive Board passed by the executive board Gerhard Haus@@ ru@@ ck@@ inger , shared the company .
he will officially assume the function of a &quot; chief speaker , &quot; until a successor is found for Hartmann .
the company called &quot; different views &quot; for the long @-@ term business alignment .
details did not want to mention a company on Friday .
who will become the market research company in future , be still un@@ clear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in An@@ gli@@ ger@@ au it was on Friday , at the shareholders , the disappoin@@ ting continued over the continued success of years ago initiated restructuring . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Hartmann is the Gf@@ K @-@ tip since 2011 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fruits of restructuring , however , are not yet to be seen after 5 years &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the last bad Gf@@ K business numbers any inc@@ lin@@ ers will eventually be rest@@ less .
&quot; if it were in case of BMW , that would also do the qu@@ and@@ ts so , &quot; said it .
after set@@ backs in the preceding quarter , the company had no chance to stop its loss of shipping in the second quarter of 2016 .
with a total of 36@@ 1.2 million euros , revenue grew by 6.1 percent below the comparable year of the previous year .
sales in the first half of the year resulted in sales of 7@@ 2@@ 1.2 million euros by 3.4 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the profit in the second quarter mainly bur@@ dened by the un@@ secured value of the company in view of its difficult economic situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Group &apos;s business experience needed in the Consumer Experience business experience gained a loss of € 14@@ 8.2 million by the Group under the stroke .
the Gf@@ K generated a net profit of 19.@@ 7 million in the second quarter of 2015 .
accidents - bus slip in scrat@@ ches in gra@@ bs : eight injured
in an accident of a travel agent with 43 sen@@ iors as a passenger , eight people were injured in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ ir@@ n ( Land@@ kreis Aur@@ ich ) .
two of the occup@@ ants suffered severe injuries , shared the police .
the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach had to ev@@ ade their data according to a counter@@ act , partly on the road .
the bus came to the right from the road and sli@@ d into a dit@@ ch , like an spokes@@ woman in the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the bus , people were unable to leave the bus independently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire brig@@ ade liberated the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ances and a vehicle came to the accident at the national road 2 .
the last travelers were brought back by a Lin@@ i@@ enb@@ us back to the surrounding area Pe@@ ws@@ um .
there you should wait for a replacement bus from the travel company .
investig@@ ators demanded the load @-@ driver and possible witnesses to report on the police .
the fees per cubic metre of waste amounts from 1 October 2016 for the area of the se@@ wage plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ fare 3.@@ 44 instead of 2.@@ 10 euros ; for Z@@ ult@@ enberg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / L@@ opp 3,@@ 36 Euro ( previously 2,@@ 26 Euro ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 Euro ( previously 2,@@ 18 euros ) .
at the plant in Az@@ endorf the se@@ wage fee will be increased later , if appropriate improvement measures are necessary .
after an over@@ lap calculation , the wast@@ e@@ water price in Az@@ endorf are at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic meter .
as Mayor of Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , approval of the budget by the land rat@@ chet and Kul@@ mb@@ ach , was noted that the se@@ wage works are run for these se@@ wer@@ age .
Kas@@ endorf Market was obliged to provide legal foundations due to legal foundations .
as of October 1 , 2016 , the citizens and industrial companies from Wel@@ sh grapes , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ opp , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Z@@ ult@@ enberg will have to drop deeper into the pur@@ se .
the fee increases between 48 and 67 percent .
managing director Herbert Schmidt on the committee , was necessary to calculate the fees for waste heat systems .
in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 also over@@ - or sub@@ covers from the previous calendar period be termin@@ ated .
in all three se@@ wage increases , the gra@@ ding increases were relatively small facilities with a very low waste in@@ firm@@ ness , which lie between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year .
due to the small distribution base , for example , expend@@ itu@@ res would work for necessary repairs of several thousand euros .
the se@@ wage waste in all three systems is slightly dec@@ lining .
in the past financial period of all three plants , not least , due to its age , renovation and repair expenses in a substantial amount .
the plant in Az@@ endorf was nearly 30 years old , the facilities for world cup , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Z@@ ult@@ enberg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and L@@ opp almost 20 years old .
Schmidt rejected that in the wast@@ e@@ water plant Az@@ endorf replaced the mechanical ventilation system due to a loss of damage .
in the P@@ ump@@ werk Wel@@ sh , the nearly 20 year @-@ old convey@@ ing systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led and the first lu@@ dge water had to be installed , after almost 20 years , the se@@ wage s@@ lu@@ dge had to be installed and an additional vent possibility can also be installed in the future .
Schmidt : &quot; for these extraordinary expend@@ itu@@ res , the continued maintenance and maintenance costs came into account in the new period of calculations . &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs , which remained significantly below the current level of calculation in the years 2011 / 2012 .
stone houses clearly stated that the small se@@ wage deteri@@ oration in the three plants took the expenses for the operation and maintenance . &quot;
in addition , Schmidt continued to have spar@@ ed the market base of great entertainment costs in the wast@@ e@@ water plants over the past 20 years .
the situation for the af@@ ore@@ mentioned grounds will continue to remain a temporary stay , since you can &apos;t expand the area of the san@@ itation of Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ acht@@ al by these facilities , because it is about deficit institutions .
Bulgaria re@@ leg@@ ates for the first time in 8 months of inflation
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria amounted to 1 % on a monthly basis .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero has been posted as positive 0.2 % since October 2012 .
the annual average income of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured after the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
the consumer price index monitored in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0 % .
inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) amounted to -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -@@ 0.2 % .
in July 2016 , a price increase in the following groups of consumer goods were observed : food and non alcoholic beverages ( 1,7 % ) ; transportation ( 1.8 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 6.3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1,2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) .
prices fell in clothing and shoes ( 2,2 % ) ; furnishings , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) .
prices remained as in the pre @-@ month at alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; apartments , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; and education remained unchanged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Snap@@ chat &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; An@@ ime &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; effect is critic@@ ized as Asian caric@@ ature . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Snap@@ chat says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some ob@@ servers say it is ir@@ sensitive to bre@@ eds .
with its filter tool , Snap@@ chat allows you to change about 150 million daily users to change reality and play with ident@@ ities in such a way that borders the absur@@ dity .
you can turn into a pine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Lich@@ ten@@ stein painting .
the filters are imm@@ ac@@ ious , self @-@ rotating tools that generate more than 30 million enhanced sel@@ ections per day .
all wron@@ gs come to the public .
Snap@@ chat filters have critic@@ ised criticism in the past where they were accused of using the app Black@@ face convey@@ ors or white skin as beauty ideal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when this week , a filter proposed a filter that gave them sli@@ pping eyes , false teeth and ev@@ apor@@ ated che@@ eks , there were some critics in a rac@@ ist cartoon by Asi@@ ans - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; j@@ aun@@ t &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they asked if these repeated contro@@ vers@@ y indicates a larger problem , that the company has diversity .
the News and Out@@ rage were widely distributed on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mother@@ board , one day after Snap@@ chat shared that it had disabled the feature .
the company offered an excuse : the filter was intended to be an homage to An@@ ime characters and not as cartoon by Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ si@@ ders who have experienced race sm@@ us , the filter re@@ minded of viol@@ ating c@@ lich@@ és .
others declined to anim@@ e comparison .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an e @-@ mail , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student , whose twe@@ et has been widespread over the photos that the filter &quot; viol@@ ating and &quot; &quot; &quot; was un@@ comfortable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to argue with the contrast of a very contradic@@ tory Asian caric@@ ature and the filter effects . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it shows that the filter has not been secured , but that the j@@ aun@@ t has been drawn into the extreme . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that this cultural stum@@ bling is crossed .
the American culture seems to be involved in an endless di@@ vers@@ al and integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the equipment that we all hold in their hands .
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats big audience of young people - who are di@@ vers@@ ed in the race as their older counter@@ actor - could rather go out of anticip@@ ating sen@@ sibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats felt a picture , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is much more difficult for a user , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is much more difficult to remember that such things were un@@ noticed when it was the case , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 25 year old K@@ atie Z@@ hu said in an interview on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday Z@@ hu decided to work as product manager and engineer for medium to delete their Snap@@ chat account and asked others to do the same .
in an essay for medium and in a phone interview she said they believe that r@@ ass@@ en@@ related controversi@@ es has a lack of diversity in the adjustment practices at Snap@@ chat .
Z@@ hu critic@@ ized the big part of white , only male guidance and ended its essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ ete@@ Snap@@ chat .
&quot; either I have no different representation of people with other skin colors , so they can make such decisions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they have people with other skin colors who work there , but not in positions where they are safe or comfortable in order to say something about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint that is largely un@@ answered by the Snap@@ chat .
the company publishes no figures to the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as private companies .
on Thursday , Snap@@ chat retired to discuss the cultural back@@ grounds of his staff , but according to a speaker , the company has recently recru@@ ited a staff of staff , which focuses on internal population groups and on internal integration efforts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hu said that she will open their Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask myself if they need more users like us to say that this is not O.@@ K. . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
military leadership f@@ ake ISIS secret service information , represents the Congress of the Congress
military personnel from the United States Central Command Chang@@ ed Information Information , in order to draw an optimum picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria as it would have allowed the actual conditions on site to report a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of rep@@ ubli@@ can members , intelligence Committee and military bud@@ get@@ ary , reported by great dis@@ satisfaction under Central Command Intelligence Service analysts , reported how reported their ass@@ ess@@ ments to the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State .
central Command , shortly Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ ampa , Florida , which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; News &quot; News &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; News &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; news for information that were typically associated with high @-@ ranking Cent@@ Com Commander in terms of terrorism as it would have allowed the actual conditions on site and were consistently positive as analysis of other news services , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cited an article for newspaper article . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers are suffering if bad analyses will be presented by our political leaders , &quot; said Ken Cal@@ vert , rep@@ ubli@@ can member of the representative office .
the management errors in Cent@@ Com range up to the top head of the organization .
the 10th @-@ page report shows clearly consistent problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analysis of the American efforts in education for the Iraqi forces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although there are no direct indications that government peaks have given instructions to alter the reports , it shows how analysts were exposed to the pressure of its laws , even known as ISIS or IS@@ IL . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , opinions and statements from the congress were clearly more positive than the facts &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , a Cent@@ Com employee publicly announced that a military recovery of Mos@@ sul@@ s could already begin in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after months of investigations , it is much clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , rep@@ ubli@@ can Congress of Kansas , in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the middle of 2014 to the middle of the year 2015 , the tops of Central Command changed the reporting service reports to shut down the danger through ISIS in Iraq .
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans called the Task Force to live after them , analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by detailed findings during the investigation .
in addition , Cent@@ Com reports are underway by the General Secretary of the Defense Department of Defense .
the democratic members of the news service provider published their own findings on Thursday , with some of the conclusions of the rep@@ ubli@@ can Task Force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ Com created an excessive restricted process for creating retro@@ fitting in@@ estim@@ ations on IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the highest ranking polit@@ ician , member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives Adam B. ship , was announced in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this process , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Schiff , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; delayed the publication of the reporting service reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was ashamed of analysts and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exc@@ essi@@ vely little room for sof@@ ten@@ ing opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Mr. Schiff and Democrats gave evidence of having no clu@@ es on a intervention of the White House at Cent@@ Com analysts regarding a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certain political opinion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
preliminary results of the congress results were published on Tuesday through &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
last August , the New York Times reported by investigations by the Pentagon &apos;s general inspec@@ tions that were recorded following complaints from Cent@@ Com analysts .
Lt@@ . C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Evans , a company spokes@@ man of the Pentagon , gave in an opinion that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the Congress , while the investigation of the General@@ in@@ spec@@ tor was still underway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he also gave that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts sometimes quite di@@ li@@ fy opinions about the interpretation of complex data , and that the news services and the Ministry of Defence will welcome a controversial discussion of these important topics of national defence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the investigations have rejected the question of a successful air@@ campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion that is meanwhile being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the accus@@ ations of last year , however , rejected the question , how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest estim@@ ations of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criticism concerning the Islamic State remind of the Islamic state of more than ten years ago , as a Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st , Gregory Hoo@@ ker , a written part of many analysts only a small occup@@ ying force in Iraq , looking forward to making a little time on the consequences of invasion of 2003 .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the uprising against the current coverage of the Islamic State .
last year , the team around Mr. Hoo@@ ker proved to susp@@ end government susp@@ ects that they had no significant impact on the government &apos;s financial situation , because these provisional refin@@ eries had put into operation since these provisional refin@@ eries had put into operation in order to sell oil on the black market .
however , this knowledge was not published , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ nation , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ized by members of the Legisl@@ ative due to its excessive positive assessment during a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin went into retirement in April and was replaced at Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the US wins fourth match in the hockey game of women , show@@ down a show@@ down with the UK .
one day after having shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two gates of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3 @-@ 0 .
five gates in two games should actually represent a memorable achievement , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she could not remember that ever done .
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I don &apos;t belong to people who keep their goals in memory .
however , they know : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic Con@@ tests and are equ@@ alled to their group with the Brit@@ on in the first place that after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan remain unbe@@ aten .
Britain and the United States will be meeting on Saturday in the last round of the first round .
both teams have qualified for the quarter final , the game will decide which the two teams will gain from the first and second place within their group of six teams .
the first placed is the strong Dutch little bit longer out of the way that the other group will lead .
as always the game may go out on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising vor@@ tex through their success story , four years after they landed with the last London games on the last of 12 seats .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and was the first time with three years a hockey ra@@ cket in hands ( her two older sisters played at the sports at Dre@@ xel University ) , at 16 years she became a national player in the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
they missed the Olympics in 2008 as they could not qualify for the cad@@ res .
then came the year 2012 , where she and her team did everything wrong .
in the following year , Craig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , coach of the national team and thus began to turn things better .
&quot; a cultural change , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am .
we did not have the work places in London , which we have now .
we have completely ri@@ pped the ru@@ d@@ der .
on Thursday night B@@ am opened the cake in the first half of the game with a set@@ back from the close area .
India had gone to the game without victory in the tournament , but the team showed up surprisingly tough and kept the score from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter , until B@@ am took the game in their hands .
she performed a Sprint with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved into the middle and lu@@ sted the ball into the gate around the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 lead .
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the tournament for the go@@ al@@ keeper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who previously had to book a goal in each of the previous games .
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in a good position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
immersed in the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , Zen of the Tramp@@ ol@@ ins
wherever you are , how late it is , it is the Olympic Games .
the events in Rio de Janeiro are constant and inevitable , a rapid Staff@@ ell@@ an between competition and pursu@@ it .
it is , as if the Olympic tor@@ ch itself is a burning staff , which is served as a swi@@ mmer to Turner for tri@@ athletes .
you can &apos;t listen to the TV , read a newspaper or listen when talking about your neighbors in the Coff@@ es@@ hop , without hearing Simone Bal@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is for the first time with the Olympic Games and a woman &apos;s black with dimples , could have been sent by these well @-@ known names using sponsors and well @-@ being TV advertising , if he would be a s@@ wimm@@ ers , Turner or even fen@@ nel .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fighting in Olympic tramp@@ ol@@ ines around gold .
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate any event .
further from the centre , partly in the shade are the sports that are not univers@@ ally recognised : aerial shooting , ar@@ cher@@ y , bad@@ minton , Ta@@ ek@@ w@@ ondo .
we will always swim the breast@@ plate , and may reign for a long time .
but if I should make some humble arguments for my particular favourite , then let me turn the attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline .
although it has been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it had been an Olympic event since 2000 , it was noticed that many people had question@@ ed so many that , I was question@@ ed , didn &apos;t know that there is an Olympic port@@ art .
this could also be regional ignor@@ ance .
although the USA has sent the competition for competition , it has never gained a medal on the trampoline and had a athl@@ ets until 2012 , who made it to the final round .
the Chinese and Russians will tend to share prices for men and the Chinese and the Can@@ adi@@ ans for women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ Lenn@@ an from Canada will defend her gold medal from London this year .
the trampoline jumping has a certain exterior char@@ ms , partly because it sounds for the un@@ en@@ lighten@@ ed ear than that sounds for the Olympic Games .
at this point I should admit that I &apos;m not an expert , but only a loving enthusi@@ ast .
it has humor@@ ously potential - the cart@@ o@@ on@@ ous trem@@ bling of his never ending up - but also the Gra@@ zie of the gym and diving , the two sports which are essentially re@@ united .
the word &quot; trampoline &quot; comes from the Spanish El trampoline , which means as much as &quot; spring@@ board . &quot;
emerging vic@@ tors jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 foot in the air and must land a number of falling movements ( turning , h@@ ens and Sal@@ tos ) before they land on the feet .
they are judged by an official Olympic team after exec@@ uting , difficulty level , and &quot; flight time . &quot;
two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete in Rio .
the most common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; med@@ alli@@ sts must go on in their quest for gold , quicker , go up and go back , sometimes until the finish , sometimes and back , down and down on the playground . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they do not only hunt the finish line or the power wall , but also in the television transmission a further polite goal : the world or the Olympics .
the targeted stro@@ kes is no@@ bel , ad@@ mira@@ ble , even fan@@ atic - and it &apos;s enough to make even a viewer to tears .
but it is also what I think even when watching this games as a somewhat ti@@ ring .
this trampoline offers an attraction .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
he or her p@@ all@@ t , seem@@ ingly he@@ avi@@ est as an ast@@ ron@@ aut , goes up , then down@@ wards , then back to the top .
there is also a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the destination , no v@@ ault into the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant up@@ lifting of time and gravity .
it is so Zen like the competition for the Olympic Games can only be .
the Quali@@ fication and En@@ dr@@ ons of Women will take place on Friday afternoon , at 13.@@ 00 Eastern Time in streaming ; which the men on Saturday , also at 13.@@ 00 .
N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the end customers as part of an afternoon block at 2 days from 14.00 .
in the midst of the Olympia @-@ Man@@ ia they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that will probably survive in general tum@@ ult .
when the increase of consciousness is achieved only by the att@@ ach@@ ments and objec@@ ti@@ fication of male athletes - like the male US Turner , according to The Wall Street Journal recently suggested - then Mr Do@@ ol@@ ey expects its air rin@@ ses , new fan@@ base .
&quot; a generation protest@@ ing &quot; in Ethiopia , Long is a member of the USA
violent protest in Ethiopia
protest@@ ers , the political changes in Ethiopia are calling for violent resistance to the government .
witnesses say that many protest@@ ers were killed during clas@@ hes with the police in heav@@ iness .
is Ethiopia just to break with it ?
in the past ten years , it was one of the weal@@ thier countries in Africa , a solid war with a rapidly growing economy .
but in the last few months , protests against the government had shaken the country and expanded more areas .
last week , thousands of people stor@@ med down streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
according to human rights organisations , the answer of the government was merciful .
witnesses said that polic@@ emen were shot and killed in un@@ armed protest@@ ers .
in circulation , videos about protests , probably from the last or early of this year , show how security guards beat young people with sticks , while they were forced to make a stand against a wall .
the head of the UN Security Council for Human Rights now requires an incoming examination .
&quot; it was always difficult to keep this country , and in future it becomes even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa from the International Crisis Group , a research group .
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country of Africa and its stability is estimated from the West .
American military and secret services are working closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terror across the region , in particular in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if at all , get so much Western help .
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a remarkable pace .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new campaign in Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
the roads are usually quiet , safe and clean .
even though Ethiopia was anything but an example of democracy - human rights organisations have continued to lead the op@@ pression by government - the opposition in the country has been restricted , with dis@@ si@@ dents effective for silence .
many were sent into exile , or put into prison , or driven into the wilderness of the desert .
but that might change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you supp@@ ress people and do not have any other options except protest@@ ing , it breaks out &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Li@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a teacher in the Ethiop@@ ian Ethiop@@ ian . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the entire youth protest@@ ed .
a generation protest@@ ed .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from the land use to dig@@ ging in relation to power the ruling coalition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a widespread election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , ten@@ sions descend along the border to Er@@ it@@ rea ; a struggle for these z@@ jag@@ ged , controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June .
analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts as the O@@ ro@@ mo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden , who were more or less forced in recent years , could be more beneficial to tur@@ mo@@ il .
several factors explain why feelings of inter@@ bit@@ ing after years of age has been explo@@ de under the surface .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
only in recent years , very many Ethiop@@ ians were able to communicate with the social media , as cheap Smartphones was becoming more and more common and the internet services improved .
even if the government blocked the access to Facebook and Twitter , especially at regular intervals , many people still do more about Internet @-@ Pro@@ x@@ ies to hide , where they can stop .
several young Ethiop@@ ians gave it to be the protests .
the second factor is that there are more solidarity between the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two biggest eth@@ nic@@ ities in Ethiopia .
the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ a are not natural enemies .
since E@@ tr@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ a prosp@@ ered from branches , mainly Christian high countries , in politics and business , while they explo@@ ited the O@@ ro@@ mos , many of which are many Muslims and live in low@@ land areas .
but this also changes .
&quot; we are to coordin@@ ate under a umbrella , &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the O@@ ro@@ mos .
the biggest protests were held in areas of Am@@ har@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mos have dominated the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray , which accounts for around 6 percent of the population and most dominant in the military , in trade and politics .
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was until his death in a non @-@ public illness in 2012 17 years of Ethiopia &apos;s prime minister .
he was regarded as a tac@@ tical gen@@ ius , a man who could think about corners .
analysts say that it was particularly ver@@ aging to perceive early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and to use special officers to edit opponents and make them harmful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime is lacking in this fundamental skill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s new Prime Minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen from relatively op@@ a@@ que reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es .
unlike Mr Mel@@ es , who came from the Tiger region in Northern Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the South .
analysts say that he enjoys the confidence of the safety services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time that Ethiopia had experienced such a ri@@ ot in 2005 , after thousands of elections were protest@@ ing against the government and stolen by the government .
during the following Raz@@ ants , many Protest@@ ants were killed , even though it was less than in the last months , and the rest of the un@@ rest went relatively quickly .
development experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning , such as the new lease , and for their measur@@ able progress in poverty .
but obviously this did not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal abuse of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous ethnic shape .
last month , Protest@@ ants in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ a city , led by Tig@@ ray and the hatred towards the Tig@@ ray is becoming more common in social media .
analysts say that the protests against the US and other Western allies put in a pec@@ uli@@ ar position .
the American government used Ethiopia as a basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights over the neighbor@@ ing Somalia , even if they recently told they had closed this base .
while the West clearly wants to support democracy , he does not want his ally to collapse in an already vol@@ at@@ ile area .
&quot; this , &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; is a very thin ti@@ gh@@ trop@@ e . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump declar@@ es his claim Obama was founded in ISIS &quot; Sar@@ cas@@ m . &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to scatter the last contro@@ vers@@ y on Friday that surro@@ unds his campaign by calling his multiple repeated asser@@ tion , President Obama and Hillary Clinton would have been the &quot; founder of the Islamic State , not seriously . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this clari@@ fication cast new questions about the communication skills of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans to communicate , whether he is able to communicate clearly with the American public . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also brings his co@@ hes@@ ites who ende@@ avor to take him during an event@@ ful stage in protection , to explain in the pec@@ uli@@ ar position , which he could not have meant .
after he had made the statement on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump had taken back on Thursday &apos;s claim on Thursday and insist@@ ed on interviews that he really did not int@@ end to sei@@ ze ISIS and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS .
but in an early morning Twe@@ et a Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump said , he was just sar@@ c@@ astic .
the twe@@ et was contrary to the previous day where Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a number of interviews , he said the accus@@ ation perfectly seriously .
when the conservative radio present@@ er Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tr@@ ump wanted to re@@ we@@ aken the statement , that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS is willing to know nothing about the rep@@ ubli@@ can candidate .
the last storm of cr@@ iti@@ que lies on Mr. Tr@@ ump , while he tries to focus the focus of his campaign for falling demand on economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton talked to economic situation in Michigan this week .
on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to return again to this subject .
via Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clin@@ ton &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
at the end of July he moved strong criticism , when he said the Russians should look at Mrs. Clin@@ ton &apos;s emails , but later he said &quot; Of course , &quot; I said the sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one the lingu@@ istic boundaries in politics and then back to rowing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it is one of its methods to test how certain messages are taken from his fans , as they arrive , and eventually &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to how the reaction fails . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who observed the language of both candidates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , I think he is smart enough to keep his statements vag@@ ue enough so they can be interpreted in different ways .
instead of def@@ use the sound for the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump has assumed an unknown tone , because its demand went further back .
a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ is , which was published on Friday , showed a guided tour with a big lead in the states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ in @-@ head @-@ race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump generally tries to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ ative remarks , he accused his critics to dist@@ ort his testimony , or to understand his testimony .
but while he stands in focus on the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps joke his loy@@ alist Mit@@ stre@@ iter brought to him in an un@@ comfortable situation , regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative also may be his testimony .
Rudolph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York , and one of Tr@@ um@@ ps most prominent advoc@@ ates , there were great effort to defend the candidates today in a CNN interview of Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe what he says is legitim@@ ate , political comments &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Giuli@@ ani , so he was inter@@ ro@@ gated by Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps that Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true in this sense that Obama was an almost unknown , small organization ago , he called them back@@ ben@@ der , completely false and therefore it happened because he drew off the troops from Iraq .
most ma@@ inst@@ ream rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to argue that Mrs. Clinton served as an Foreign Minister , in which Mrs. Clinton served as an external minister having allowed ISIS to spread out the situation in the Middle East .
before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump put his attacks on the media , and cast them out to be pre@@ set against him on each of his words .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he de@@ fied the &quot; poor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts who try to understand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t do it ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the demo@@ cr@@ ats sp@@ ott@@ led over Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps , as only a further evidence that he was un@@ suitable for the presidential office .
once passed over the price of the market , Café is back in Green@@ point
Ver@@ b Cafe was a sh@@ amed cafe in William@@ sburg , where you could only pay cash , that no Wi @-@ Fi had , but for 15 years , good coffee served .
of course , the prizes were driven out of his Bed@@ ford Avenue Lad@@ in front .
the business of So@@ ap Ch@@ erie that replaced Ver@@ b in the summer of 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
native people mentioned it as a final loss in the opposite city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cra@@ b@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I can still not believe that C@@ BGB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel except and Ver@@ b is now a soap shop . &quot;
but if New York change is change , then it &apos;s re@@ warding .
a revi@@ ved Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new version has Wi @-@ Fi and accept credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similar atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the Ver@@ b is Cisco Rodri@@ guez , a long @-@ standing employee of the old caf@@ és , the owner and managing director of the new caf@@ és .
he started working in Ver@@ b in 2001 and stayed there until the end .
when a customer came to offer funds for a new out@@ set , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ guez , 36 , kept a lot .
ver@@ b uses the same distributor for bag@@ els purchased the same es@@ pres@@ so machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old ver@@ b .
but Rodri@@ guez said that he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu sand@@ wi@@ ches stand with bacon and cheese and there are gar@@ ages like cap@@ ers and s@@ auti@@ ous onions .
there are natural sc@@ ams .
the café serves no beer more , but there &apos;s fresh ju@@ ices .
after nine months Rodri@@ guez said that he had noticed a silent current of old stem customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many old customers were also driven by prices of William@@ sburg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently , Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer on Sunday .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in William@@ sburg and visited the ver@@ b regularly .
even after being moved to Green@@ point , she would take the way off .
after the ver@@ b had closed , she gave a while the coffee break , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I realized that it was on the coffee and the culture of the Ver@@ b which I liked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she drinks coffee , even if they stood on this day instead of their usual iced coff@@ ees a Bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea , which is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been another long @-@ standing and loyal customer since the beginning of the fall in 2003 .
he went there before work and set inev@@ it@@ ably the same .
&quot; I came a quarter after seven , every day as a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Everything @-@ Ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; he said .
photo Rodri@@ guez said he wanted to experiment and record new ingredients in the menu .
nowadays , Ros@@ enthal gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Everything @-@ Ba@@ gel with bacon , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ guez said that he did not take a gro@@ ll that the soap shop has taken the old business room .
in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie set to produce a special soap for Ver@@ b with the ch@@ ill coffee of the coffee bar as an ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we will go down on their offer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ guez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional , Polish inhabitants of Green@@ points have also accepted the Café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new customer has translated the menu in Poland and Rodri@@ guez said that he has prepared to be able to set them out soon so that his new neighbours will feel welcome . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the location has further advantages .
a local saf@@ ari @-@ locally wants to fill and sell the ch@@ illed coffee in bottles .
there is a chance that the café is expanding to a neighbouring building .
for many customers a new b is enough to get their old favor@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was regular and said that he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed .
when the new cafe was opened , Wh@@ itt said that the appearance of the Lok@@ as and the beast felt a new coffee like a hom@@ ec@@ oming .
&quot; I had to smell it , &quot; he said .
the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; a abundant meal &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his asc@@ ension to President , Franklin Del@@ ano Roosevelt took up his lunch at the O@@ val Office .
on Fifth Avenue , President Roosevelt had a pen@@ chant for refined delic@@ ac@@ ies of Fifth Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de Fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland .
his menu on this day was a bit more modest : stu@@ ffed eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and as dessert a pl@@ um p@@ ud@@ ding .
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; Jane Z@@ iegel@@ man said .
her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to Americans they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food hist@@ ori@@ ans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; co@@ es last book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; acted by the Chinese cuisine in the USA , while brick is told in her book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about life in a residential home on the Lower East Side of the food perspective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will be published on Tuesday in Har@@ per publishing house , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity when they meet with a rep@@ orter in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s sandwich shop for dinner , a small , schn@@ itz@@ ky I@@ mb@@ iss in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has already been in business since the stock market crash 1929 .
Z@@ iegel@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh water back with olive pieces , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable mixture .
as the rep@@ orter posed min@@ ced , this found the pair for a discussion about eating in the era of Great Depression .
&quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; said Z@@ iegel@@ man .
pean@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread .
they were prepared from an ingredient , something cheap that stretches the ingredient .
imagine to eat so many pean@@ uts , that they serve them as a dinner .
CO@@ E gr@@ inn@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must have laid down in the stomach as lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before the Great Depression the table was in a American household , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
the teams of women cooked for male fel@@ lows and it was served fresh baked past@@ ries for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was the Americans that were sent to a hungry Europeans during the first world war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; records the ways with which the country converted it to be no more s@@ lar@@ aff@@ en@@ land . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time when food was a central theme for the Americans , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; got co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
just as ten@@ se , the new budget was as ten@@ se : mysterious foods such as bread and c@@ asser@@ tions were found at stap@@ le foods that could hide c@@ asserole , because Kö@@ che could hide un@@ appe@@ ti@@ zing ingredients under a cre@@ amy sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dried fruit .
meat , which was the centre of the American kitchen , became a rare luxury .
strange bl@@ ends were tried , since a rich and nutr@@ itious satisfaction was prec@@ e@@ worthy of taste or even whol@@ es@@ ome food .
during her research for the book , which also includes recipes , they prepared a dish made of this ep@@ och , fried onions with pean@@ ut butter , too .
&quot; it was not a popular supplement on noon , &quot; Co@@ e says .
Z@@ iegel@@ mann continues to carry out : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pean@@ ut butter and fried onions do not match each other .
it was typical for many of the home recipes .
as never before or since then , household econom@@ ists - including Louise Stanley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 @-@ 1943 - the eating habits of the country .
by published recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines , they encourage women to become &quot; bud@@ get@@ ary sp@@ ol@@ iti@@ ves &quot; and the challenge , P@@ amp@@ e like cre@@ amy sp@@ aghetti with carrots to transform into delicious meals .
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; is a celebration of historic treats .
in particular , the reports about the answer of the government to star@@ ving citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ vers L@@ ass @-@ Cake @-@ Essen @-@ Att@@ itude .
as he publicly pra@@ ises the simple Iowa farmers kitchen of his cuisine , it sp@@ it as the one million@@ th man from the world to which he has become .
&quot; he liked the continental kitchen like fish with cucum@@ ber , &quot; Co@@ e said .
he did eat in an almost g@@ ild@@ ed dining room , and wore a smo@@ king .
he was marvellous in reality .
President Roosevelt would perhaps have committed the same mistake , if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had asked him to stat@@ ute an extra post@@ mark with his stomach .
as described in the book , a house@@ keeper with no interest in flav@@ ours caused by Mrs Roosevelt said that the White House brought the most boring food in Washington but also one of the most controversial food . &quot;
many of the species from the era of Great Depression , deal with food , was rejected once the country came back to the legs .
the legacy is on our continuing focus on calories and food , Z@@ iegel@@ man said , as well as science has been applied to food .
the couple gave to the writing of the book the eating habits of Z@@ iegel@@ mans @-@ in @-@ law much better - for example how they could not throw away food@@ stu@@ ffs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ iegel@@ man re@@ minded : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they actually made people ill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the wind@@ fall incident .
after the plate was evacu@@ ated by Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , it moved and co@@ e to produce a dessert that she had prepared at home : the pl@@ ums , which had lunch at noon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Z@@ iegel@@ man , and added that it was a usual trick to miss a modest name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were no proposed cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everyone appeared somewhat re@@ lu@@ ct@@ antly to fill a spoon in the tough , brown Gli@@ b@@ ber .
surprisingly , it was not so bad .
CO@@ E won three times a surcharge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ di@@ tier@@ er , he said to his wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A few chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
killed in bomb attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he set his own life to help others : Khaled Omar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khaled Omar took his life in Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has died at a st@@ icky assault of the Assad regime .
Omar was a member of the &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a civil protection group that previously saved nearly 60,000 people .
29@@ 00 volunteers are dedicated to their own lives to move people out of bom@@ bed houses and to get the first aid in the field of war .
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
Omar was the face of the group : a video of the civil servant that shows him in a 11 @-@ hour res@@ cu@@ ing of a n@@ ursing inf@@ ant from the tru@@ ff@@ ers of a house , went to the world in 2014 .
it made the Syrians on the radiant symbol@@ ism in the hor@@ ror of war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but as heroes , he has never seen himself , loud , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , this is the real Ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I am dying , I think that God sees a mart@@ yr for me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before Omar himself fell victim to his victims , he had talked about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria .
the helicop@@ ters have cast four barrel bombs over the Alz@@ adia district , which was filled with chlorine gas .
a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from breath .
&quot; we eliminate the po@@ ison@@ ous rem@@ n@@ ants of the bomb , so that no children can play with it , &quot; c@@ ites the image of his last words before he died .
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to meet terrorists .
Greenland : the oldest cycl@@ one is nearly 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland is usually only in winter to the surface .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the S@@ anna research ship .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and swi@@ ms with a 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - to the present day .
Greenland only became young with 150 years of age .
le@@ is@@ urely , the Greenland @-@ shar@@ k swi@@ ms along the ground of the North Atlantic , in an hour he has an average of 1.@@ 220 meters .
only when it comes to it , the five meters long animal acceler@@ ates on a full 2.6 km / h - and this top speed is half as fast as a seal .
this long @-@ term lifestyle seems to be a sponsor for a high age .
Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report the professional journal &quot; Science &quot; at any rate of a Greenland who could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mad@@ ness , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; commented Alexander Shel@@ ter from the Max Planck Institute for demo@@ graphic research in Rostock , this life span , which means a world record for ver@@ te@@ br@@ ates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
indeed , the Evol@@ ution@@ ary biolog@@ ist suspected that Greenland will be pet@@ ri@@ fied .
only the evidence failed .
Greenland is difficult to observe , eventually they live primarily in the ice sea before the spar@@ sely populated co@@ asts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard .
because you prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear in the winter only in winter .
researchers have little knowledge about the lifestyle of Greenland .
her tim@@ pent@@ pent@@ agon w@@ ells them , when they spread six animals with a transmitter in front of the S@@ val@@ bard .
nevertheless , in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a Rob@@ be , another one had swallowed the jaw bone of a young polar bear .
perhaps they hunt sleeping animals or pat@@ ro@@ using at the bottom of the ice cream and are looking for Kad@@ aver , which tor@@ ches out of higher water layers .
Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues studied 28 Grön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie , the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as a by@@ catch from the depth of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cen@@ timet@@ res long , while the biggest 502 @-@ cen@@ timet@@ res measured .
to determine the age of animals , they analyzed the line core of the shar@@ ks with the carbon @-@ 14 method .
this centre of the eye lens emerges already before the birth of the shar@@ ks , which are not renewed in the proteins later .
the two smallest shar@@ ks had a lot of carbon @-@ 14 in line @-@ up .
their birth should therefore lie down after the early 1960s , as a nuclear test , larger quantities of this radio@@ active carbon in the atmosphere worse .
in the length of 220 cen@@ tim@@ eters long , the line core contained a low surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from nuclear weapons , so it is likely to have celebrated his 50th birthday at his study in 2012 .
all bigger Grön@@ land@@ shar@@ ks had normal carbon @-@ 14 quantities in its line @-@ core , which occurs by cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ clock for a 4@@ 93 cm long Greenland @-@ shar@@ k showed an age of 335 or even during the record shar@@ k with 502 cen@@ tim@@ eters even 3@@ 92 years old .
that Greenland @-@ shar@@ k females only get offspring when they are more than four meters , was known .
now the researchers were able to assign an age to the length of the length .
since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 cen@@ tim@@ eters probably stood at the threshold of the sexually mature and his age was built with 156 years , Grön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie with the multip@@ lication is obviously at least one and a half centuries time .
this should also be the world record for ver@@ te@@ br@@ ates .
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ eme are mainly living in icy waters , is no co@@ incidence .
also the previous record holder , a 211 year old Grön@@ land@@ w@@ al , in his bacon on the neck a 120 year old Har@@ pun@@ en@@ spitze , was caught before Alaska .
the low temperatures often runs in the organism of living animals on a fl@@ aming tor@@ ment .
they interven@@ e later - and slow down .
to keep warm in cold water , the animals are often very large .
because the volume is growing much faster than its surface , by which the beast gets heat .
the heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much bigger than with an grams of elephant .
another advantage : you have less enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal lives so dangerous and should focus on it as early as possible as possible as possible , as if possible , as soon as possible as possible , &quot; explains the Evol@@ ution@@ ist Sch@@ izophren@@ lein .
a very big animal should always invest his resources in long life .
building site in double pack
with issues around the building , the municipal council has focused mainly in recent session .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with relief , the panel took the notification of mayor Robert P@@ utz said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , the marketing of the recently designated housing complex can begin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the boundary , par@@ cel@@ ing and supervision can be clari@@ fied and the mot@@ ions could be placed on survey@@ ing , the sale of plots in the residential areas &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; road route &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( area Bin@@ der@@ straße 1 ) is no longer in the way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the municipal council is convinced that the bun@@ ches in the rural and quiet residential community Schön@@ au young families and caring sen@@ iors alike .
as it was said , building permission from now on in the town hall can be advised about the awar@@ ding of the par@@ c@@ els will be advised in its September session .
in order to settle other commercial companies , linked to the creation of jobs , the municipal council decided to change the newly @-@ created area plan in partial areas during the spring of this year .
in the Unter@@ tim@@ lar@@ n area , the commercial area is expanded by two plots towards state road 2@@ 112 .
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ xit
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city of Main is therefore in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg will move the best chances to attract new jobs and companies from London . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt benefited from the Bre@@ xit vote , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the competence center financial markets and real estate markets of the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Bre@@ xit referendum , it is uncertain whether money stores continue from London from financial transactions throughout the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the so @-@ called EU @-@ Pass you have enough approval in the UK .
this is just great US banks .
several banks have already announced to shift jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lob@@ b@@ ying association deals with 10000 new jobs on the Main in five years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Frankfurt , the I@@ W , speaking the headquarters of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , un@@ ites responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the euro@@ zone , as well as other important authorities as European insurance coverage E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk of ES@@ R@@ B .
in Paris , the organization for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) have its headquarters , but this is less important to the ECB than the ECB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to the Emer@@ gency tank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ W Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Luxembourg , Luxembourg heated a large fund sector , but as well as Dublin in the infrastructure worse .
Frankfurt am far easier to reach thanks to the grand airport .
further points the city with easily available commercial premises .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris it is not easy to find free @-@ quality offices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the Seine , the rent for first @-@ class commercial premises are 50 percent higher than in the Main .
in addition , Frankfurt bi@@ ased a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical supplies and infrastructure as well as less crime .
in a ranking of the Coun@@ sel@@ ing Mer@@ cer , the city stands on No.@@ seven , Luxembourg on No.@@ 19 , Dublin on No.@@ 33 and Paris in 3@@ 7th place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even if quality of life is a question of pre@@ ferences : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its strong position as a financial centre for the European inland market , Frankfurt could attract further banks and investors &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the I@@ W ref@@ uses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe despite the Bre@@ xit vote , my economic researchers .
the conflict relations also speak : in London , according to figures of Landesbank Hel@@ aba at the end of 2015 , around 14@@ 4,000 people were working in the banking industry , in Frankfurt , it was 6@@ 2500 .
Gilead receives right costs from the hepat@@ itis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck

con@@ doms with ch@@ ili@@ powder , fire@@ work body promote Tanz@@ an@@ ias Ele@@ phant@@ en@@ hood
Prot@@ ective in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodox way to stop elephant out of being inhabited by people - they throw con@@ doms on them that are filled with ch@@ ili powder .
the method has proven to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , who had already trained up the idea for years ago , trained by volunteers in the north Tanz@@ an@@ ias , to use a non@@ violent four @-@ way protection method to protect their houses and harvest@@ ing without hurt animals .
previously , many spe@@ ars have used to defend .
Friday is the world @-@ eye day that is dedicated to animal welfare .
&quot; since we have developed the ... tool@@ kit , we could observe in these communities a change in their setting , that they can keep the eleph@@ ants of their fields without harm the eleph@@ ants in doing without the eleph@@ ants , &quot; said the managing director of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Damian Bell in a message .
the first two steps include the lighting of the elephant with a tor@@ ch and the bubbles in a horn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if he is not stretched down , a so called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ch@@ ili@@ cloud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ch@@ ili@@ powder mixed with earth is packed together with a fire@@ work body into a con@@ dom , whose end is fired up to the ignition pressure only .
when it is lit , the con@@ dom is spra@@ yed with a dum@@ b and spra@@ ys fine dust to ch@@ ili powder in the air .
a touch is usually already in order to ch@@ ase the eleph@@ ants .
one last option is a throwing , who sho@@ ots a gold ornam@@ entation into the air , causing a loud , bright explosion .

Jewish director defe@@ ats Berlin Hotel , because Israeli pre@@ fix was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; invitation - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots en@@ cap@@ tiv@@ ated a media release after he had betra@@ yed the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin , as it had requested Arabic guests according to an employee . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust Document@@ ation &quot; Sho@@ ah , &quot; made his anno@@ y@@ ance at the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel at the country &apos;s subur@@ b list .
however , the country was not listed among the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room .
how is it in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , possible that Israel has eliminated and deleted ?
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Bristol offers a possibility to choose Israel via an own call center .
looking for an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception .
the answer he received there , &quot; shot him , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel stated that the measure was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason , which stood behind , dis@@ b@@ anded in the director even more anger .
&quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the choice of choice was deleted , &quot; the employee of Lanz@@ mann was quoted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das - Handels@@ man called this a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great dis@@ grace &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung reports . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were horri@@ fied and over@@ thrown from this event .
that is really very sh@@ ame@@ ful .
the fact that this has worn in Germany in exactly this hotel chain , is even a bigger dis@@ grace .
no need for this statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the right conclusions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the ministers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident solved quite a great resonance in the internet , where people called the whole sc@@ andal .
some sub@@ ordin@@ ated the Kemp@@ inski Hotel , that it would have been given the alleged expression of Arab guests . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be ashamed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was pointed out in another post that is pointed out that the hotel , which is located at the noble Spa &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; near a synagogue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel quickly denied any accus@@ ations from himself and called the incident a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; see &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she ap@@ ologi@@ zed to Lanz@@ mann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Der Spiegel reports . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a direct statement , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Israel did not record into the quick selection list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published the Southern German newspaper a spokes@@ man of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it adds that the country code has now been added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
police continues Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as &amp; Gum@@ mig@@ rant against protest@@ ing Brazilian students
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; students tour together on Thursday in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo together with the police , when they were gathered to demonstrate the government &apos;s reforms &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reform &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police put Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and rubber forces against the protest@@ ers .
the difficulties began , when police officers tried to drive the students what led to the police squ@@ ir@@ ls and Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as police officers .
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations in order to express their const@@ ern@@ ation on the plans .
according to the proposals by the Govern@@ ors of Sao Paulo Ger@@ aldo Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools will be closed while 300,000 students will be wag@@ ered to save money .
some of the participants saw Gra@@ ff@@ it@@ its against provisional President Michel T@@ emer at walls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most recent protests occurred some days after demonstr@@ ators went to the streets to support the sus@@ pen@@ ded President Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , who had been dismissed from office by a vote of the Senate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
trade between Russia and Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
according to the abol@@ ition of sanctions , according to Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ h@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the trade set between Moscow and Teheran , rose by 7@@ 0,@@ 9 percent in the year .
since the international sanctions imposed against Iran , the interest in companies of Russian companies grew strongly in the country , distributed by the ambassador .
Russian businesses take existing connections with Iran , while new companies are ready to provide access to the market .
of course , the further commercial building is one of the largest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; D@@ z@@ h@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan said .
it noted that the trade between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2016 grew by 7@@ 0,@@ 9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , Russian imports increased by 9@@ 1,5 per cent in Iran and tot@@ alled $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
the trade show was reached by deliveries of aircraft , motor vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the ambassador .
D@@ z@@ h@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan goes back to this year from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
last year , the Russian foreign represent@@ ations gave around 35@@ ,000 vis@@ as , primarily Reis@@ ev@@ is@@ as , an Iranian citizen .
in addition , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries that concerns the tourist number in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia will be broken off last year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something from which the ambassador hopes it will change .
&quot; I personally can recommend the visit of the cities Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d , received the monuments of the old Persian civilization in good condition , &quot; he said .

the Minist@@ rants from the pastoral care unit Ey@@ acht@@ al @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on the way to Freiburg on a four @-@ day pilgrimage from Vill@@ ingen to Freiburg .
together , four stages were handled .
in order to bridge the time until the next Rom@@ ish drive of all ministers in the past two years , the Ober@@ Ministers Round St. Anna has decided to prepare and conduct a multi @-@ day pilgrimage .
various pilgrimage goals were tested and they finally decided for the Epis@@ cop@@ al city of Freiburg , where this year the Mer@@ cy was opened on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy in Freiburg , a special pilgrimage destination .
16 Min@@ is from B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , Gru@@ ol , and Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch and Hei@@ ligen@@ ce went on the way .

Sch@@ otte Call@@ um Sk@@ inner stor@@ med home when Br@@ ite won gold for cycling
Scotland Call@@ um Sk@@ inner ra@@ ste last night at the Cra@@ od@@ rom in Rio at the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio , when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the role of his fellow country@@ man Sir Chris Ho@@ y made herself to E@@ igen and made the legend proud when he was going home to win a victory of the favour@@ ites New Zealand .
England portra@@ yed four years ago a sho@@ cking victory , while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympi@@ ag@@ atives .
they repeated the trick after they took place in March at the London World Championships , despite the withdrawal of Ho@@ ys only a modest sixth place .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did this in time when he appeared .
Ho@@ ys reti@@ res a gap that tried K@@ ian Em@@ adi and Matt Cr@@ ampton .
Sk@@ inner was the man where they stayed when they saw potential in the vill@@ i , which un@@ folds now .
Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - four years ago with Ho@@ y vic@@ t@@ orious - and Sk@@ inner followed an Olympic champion in the qualifying rounds , but in the ar@@ ising vic@@ t@@ orious the New Ze@@ al@@ anders in the first round .
and the British Trio won the du@@ el with gold .
there was scar@@ c@@ ely back after his lap , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner took it .
a strategy change made a big part of transformation from the execution in a higher speed to slow it and allow Kenn@@ y and especially Sk@@ inner to keep the pace .
Ho@@ y looked at his position as a BBC expert and fell on Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ des , when they came to the podium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 year old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and to make a name .
we set up an Olympic champion in the final round and defeated the world champion .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph in 2012 on the page of Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys , Hin@@ des gave heed that he dropped to the railway after a weak start .
he returned this statement later and there was no ob@@ jection of England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
for such an outstanding victory there was no such problem for this time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It feels to the whole GB flags on the tri@@ b@@ une like London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have joined the team in the last three months .
we have come so badly with so many global titles that it was amazing to win over the Olympics .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation bringing seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London .
if that is a bar@@ ometer of our progress in the past five months , we expect a successful five days at the Vel@@ od@@ rom .
with the form Kenn@@ ys it is in the area of possible that he repeated the victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition .
that would be exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on 23 March ( a seem@@ ingly holy date for British sport ; also Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - an output of six gold medals and a silver medal .
this would be the same by Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y takes part in the spr@@ int , which starts today and will go over three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 year old from Bol@@ ton said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I enjoy this for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels something lonely to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If he wins two more gold medals , he should be beaten to the kn@@ ights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only med@@ alli@@ sts in the day but there were more good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ gar Wig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and Ow@@ ain Dou@@ bles qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ four Kilom@@ eters race .
they came to finish in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 .
the world record , who won gold in 2012 , was at 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place on the second day of the competition , which will focus on the Wig@@ gins with safety .
he had fought with the qualification before the qualification and called him , to measure his body size .
in the respective women &apos;s competition , which will be continued tomorrow and ex@@ its , Jo@@ anna Row@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Barker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ av@@ ie in the world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the GB Team is leaving a strong railway team to domin@@ ate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a string of medals .
after a truly extraordinary representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio were down .
it played Dr@@ amas in the background , so the resign@@ ation of the technical conductor Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April in the midst of sex@@ ism and mo@@ b@@ ing@@ ers as well as retirement of sizes like Ho@@ y and Victoria P@@ end@@ let@@ on .
however , if you see the first evening of the competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom competition , it looks quite then , as the old call for GB@@ s , which has reached the perfect moment , to be repeated .
future of the melt of Portland due to repe@@ aling the energy contract .
the future of the aluminium sh@@ rou@@ ters of Portland , Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs of workers - stand on the game since the system operator will termin@@ ate the energy supply contract , so that all delivery contracts will be distributed as the supplier of energy companies shared .
this step followed the decision of the Government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsi@@ dies to operate the plant .
a subsi@@ dy for 20 years is running in November .
up to 2,000 jobs in the facility of AL@@ CO@@ A in Portland stand on the game .
not less than 2000 jobs are direct and indirect - could be endangered with closure .
in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino effects , since the melt is around 10 percent of the total power generation Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as .
in 2014 , AL@@ CO@@ A took the point Henry melt , which led to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power station last year .
the melt by AL@@ CO@@ A in Portland loses money and risk a closure .
this stage follows the years long spec@@ ulation regarding the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last@@ ly due to the electricity price .
AG@@ L , which supplies large aluminium sh@@ red@@ ders with his Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , distributed that three other owners will announce their contracts .
the plant is in majority owned by AL@@ CO@@ A and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p are holding smaller propor@@ tions .
&quot; AG@@ L is convinced that the plant in Portland continues to operate , which means a further physical demand for electricity through the melt , &quot; shared the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L continued to say that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; securing transactions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contracts have to be entered into force from November 2016 onwards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contracts have a 12 month period of notice that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , AG@@ L will assume that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to revenue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the current supply supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential implic@@ ations for income on AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong operating markets for wholesale electricity rates .
AG@@ L told that it had already written the value of contracts in the amount of $ 187 million in &quot; expect@@ ation of cancellation . &quot;
AL@@ CO@@ A said that the deci@@ ding to book the tre@@ aties , the &quot; ability of Arti@@ as ... to operate the melt or to ensure the power supply to the melt &quot; does not affect .
the US company said that it was a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , who should have come into force in 2010 , even if it is still a statement , why it came back from the contract .
analysis of the industry &apos;s bad economic conditions in front of the possible closure of the Portland melt in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago facility close to Newcastle .
in reference to the analysts of the analysts at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Portland supplies some 600 mega@@ watts in electricity every year .
should both systems van@@ ish from the market , it would mean a significant reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
and for us as a generator it wouldn &apos;t be good , &quot; he said .
more than just a Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Reality @-@ TV @-@ Star , Kendall is on the cover of September issue of the V@@ ogue
Antonio J@@ enner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ enner C@@ lans Kris is on the cover of the cov@@ eted Sept@@ ember@@ issue of the US V@@ ogue .
Antonio , the brand ambassador of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der and the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on her Inst@@ agram account .
&quot; in a room full of people I love , brought me the sight of this Co@@ vers to crying , &quot; wrote Kendall .
the unve@@ iling of the Co@@ vers followed a bizarre ( or simply keeping up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ enner family ) , the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ enner family and producers of Ke@@ eping Up Ryan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) , as she ends the cover of her sister and end with a classic alarm : they all have a surprise partner .
it represents the c@@ lich@@ é bel@@ ated action almost every birthday episode ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; You thought that we should have forgotten you ? &quot; , with the hon@@ esty of a string at 8 o &apos; clock in the morning ) , but Kris had to participate her other girls somehow to this public@@ ity .
with regard to the September issue of the V@@ ogue , a new era of Car@@ das@@ hi@@ ans started .
Kend@@ alls great sister Kim likes her to have struck the V@@ ogue cover ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were able to see it in April 2014 ) , but the cover of September issue of the magazine is a league for themselves .
the September issue is for V@@ ogue the most sold edition of the year .
with a circum@@ ference that is similar to a fashion journal , the edition re@@ sembles a large number of advertis@@ ers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista which included 8@@ 32 pages of advertising ) .
the disclos@@ ure of his co@@ ver@@ stars will be predic@@ tive that in the last two years , pictures of the magazine persist@@ ed before the official announcement .
women who had already been on the cover include Na@@ omi Campbell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Mos@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years , more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; celeb@@ r@@ ities &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the model &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; models , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the celeb@@ r@@ ities are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the cover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oscar @-@ Pre@@ ist@@ oc@@ ate and Di@@ or brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honour .
but even at the small chance , Mrs. J@@ enner is described - which is described by the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of their generation - under the previous category , it is in good company .
these celeb@@ r@@ ities are not related to celeb@@ r@@ ities or reality stars or you@@ ths from today , who know how to turn a good Snap@@ chat video ( even if everything applies to J@@ enner ) .
they are truly talented women speaking in entertainment sector .
Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had the publication of Lem@@ on@@ ade one of the most successful years of her career .
of course J@@ enn@@ ers don &apos;t like success each .
with their reality TV history , J@@ enn@@ ers was still a bit ten@@ se in the fashion world .
in June , the former Victoria &apos;s Secret Model Stephanie Se@@ ym@@ our J@@ enner and her colleague Gig@@ i H@@ adi@@ d and called it &quot; the Mist@@ ails of the Moment . &quot;
these feelings cook up again when the news came out with the appearance J@@ enn@@ ers on the V@@ ogue Cover .
but it seems to ride on the mis@@ sil@@ es at the point .
Kendall J@@ enner is on the cover of September issue of the V@@ ogue .
it is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
it runs for Marc Jacobs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer from E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der .
they and all of her sisters sell you images of their respective pay@@ wall apps .
they sells handmade pictures of C@@ ind@@ y Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds daughter to the journal LOVE .
and in their spare time they can see in reality TV . probably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .
municipal office sites have 16@@ 0,000 people annually
more than 160@@ .000 of the country &apos;s relief centers are rejected by the municipal centres every year , while the branch is committed to the impact of further mean cuts on over@@ loaded transactions .
in Queens@@ land , three from five people - mostly older people , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ fair del@@ og@@ ations and similar have been rejected by their search on free legal advice and legal jurisdiction .
legal services of the community , which are already exc@@ essi@@ vely trained , are ready for further reductions .
from June next year , this legal center will be further 30 percent of their resources .
the director of the municipal centres of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell said that the last collection of the National Association of Municipal Centers revealed that thousands of people have been rejected every year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Far@@ rell said that the situation would only be worse , without repe@@ ating the resolution of the federal government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Queens@@ land municipal centres are chron@@ ically under@@ funded , which means thousands of people from important services that you need to be rejected , &quot; he said .
people who leave violent relationships , people who go through part@@ itions , workers who have been dismissed by separ@@ ations , workers who have un@@ just@@ ly dismissed - all these people have problems of legal way and this survey shows that they can &apos;t get help you need .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government will cut the means by 30 percent as of June 2017 . what means that thousands of helpful people from Queens@@ land will be forced to face their legal problems without any aid . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call on the Federal Prosecutor and the Federal Minister of Justice and the Federal Minister of Queens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to withdraw these medi@@ ations so that people need help you need to get legal problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , the country government filled its commitment to raise funds for sp@@ illing on the national average .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is now at the time to view the needs of the municipal centers and their customer communities and to ensure that the Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k government has invested in this important work . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weapons must not be fired to al@@ arms damage , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bord@@ ini gave on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the indictment took place only two days after the rep@@ ubli@@ can candidate , when he said to take a crowd in North Carolina , that the &quot; Second Am@@ end@@ ment People &quot; said that the &quot; Second Am@@ end@@ ment People &quot; should take place in case his rival Hillary Clinton had to be elected and judge judges .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ um@@ ps campaign clearly stated that the media would have torn his words from the context , and he would not compromise on violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Berlin / Schwerin : survey on countries elections : the SPD and the CDU lose
in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) , significant losses for the SPD and the CDU .
this is representative surveys of the Outlook Research Institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the red @-@ black government coalition could barely continue to gover@@ n north , this is not possible after demand in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in both federal states , the SPD would have the strongest party , and would have good chances of putting the head of government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD fell by 3@@ 5,@@ 6 percent five years ago to 24 percent .
according to the survey , the party began only slightly ahead of the CDU , which could come back to 23 per cent .
the third place is fought between the left and AF@@ D .
the left came to 19 per cent ( previously 18,@@ 4 percent ) , the AF@@ D would be represented by 19 percent for the first time in the country .
in spite of slight losses , the Gre@@ ens grew slightly with 6 percent ( previously : 8,7 per cent ) again into the s@@ uns@@ iner &apos;s day .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP were not represented by 3 percent in the country &apos;s day .
according to the Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties , the SPD of the survey would only come to 23 percent ( 2011 : 2@@ 8.3 per cent ) .
the CDU only reached 18 percent after 2@@ 3.4 percent .
it is still behind the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but before the left with 15 percent ( before 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the AF@@ D would be represented by 14 percent for the first time in the house of Dep@@ u@@ ties .
with 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope to return soon , the pirates would miss the entry in contrast to 2011 .
Nokia 9000 Commun@@ ic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ Mail and Internet in Time Mar@@ ks : the Nokia Commun@@ ic@@ ator came to the market 20 years ago .
the success@@ ors now domin@@ ate the world - his producer experienced a disaster .
the device weighed almost half a kil@@ ogram and was more than four times as difficult as an iPhone 5 .
it was th@@ icker and bigger , it was therefore not good in the hand .
on the contrary , it was quite kno@@ cking .
at the beginning , the built @-@ in memory was eight me@@ gab@@ y@@ tes , which would suff@@ ice today for about two times with high resolution .
an iPhone is now supplied with at least 16 gig@@ aby@@ tes .
the &quot; Nokia 9000 Commun@@ ic@@ ator &quot; came exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , into the shops - and it was the first smartphone .
for a few euros lovers can buy the equipment on the Internet , but they come from the Stone Age of the internet era .
however , 20 years ago Commun@@ ic@@ ator was a sensation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Finnish mobile phone producer had announced the product a few months earlier at the computer trade fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hannover as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; office in the West &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent a lot : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , even by fax was the communic@@ ator .
even access to web pages was possible by HTML @-@ brows@@ ers , even though qu@@ ently slowly .
a calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop .
then a small keyboard and a black and white screen found .
the price was pretty proud : 2700 D @-@ Mark , therefore approximately 1400 euros .
the average selling price of a smartphone in Germany in 2015 was 3@@ 92 euros .
no one could guess in August 1996 that the Commun@@ ic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
the smart phones are a success story , even though not for Nokia .
the mobile phone card of the Finn@@ s experienced an un@@ preced@@ ented disaster , was eventually sold to Microsoft .
today the market operates today , all of them later came as a Nokia .
being online , it is now online for many people everyday .
in 2015 , there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide .
some 1.4 billion devices have been sold to Samsung and Apple alone 5@@ 55 million pieces .
global sales with the equipment is around 400 billion euros .
these include the well @-@ running business of the countless app vend@@ ors and t@@ elecommun@@ ications companies .
around the smartphone is now an entire industry .
the decisive breakthrough to the mass market was only at the beginning of 2007 , at that time , Apple boss Steve Jobs announced on Mac &apos;s launch of the i@@ Ph@@ ones .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a phone and an internet communication , everything per touch screen easy to use .
Apple &apos;s triumph@@ al march started , even today the iPhone is the most important product of the corporation .
Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry who ruled the market had the night to see .
she finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
these days now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is a self @-@ understanding for 20 years after his invention .
on average , every German today is 88 times a day on his cell phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all need to learn to put the smartphone even once again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina ball , in the Siemens executive board for personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent acc@@ essibility is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must ste@@ er the Olympic spirit and extend He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row is not only offered in our local communities and throughout London , but in whole country renewal and prosperity .
for me , this was the largest attraction He@@ ath@@ rows , just like back in 2012 in London when we had a great effort to make sure all of our nations and regions benefited from the games .
the Olympi@@ ad brought great advantages to Strat@@ ford and the East End .
and we will achieve again by creating new opportunities for local and companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
for our local churches , we will already have 10,000 new teachers to create 40,000 new jobs and prepare an end to the youth unemployment in the airport .
as they were ahead of us in London in 2012 , there will be those who think the challenge of the extension of He@@ ath@@ rows is too large .
I was told that England will never be ready for the games , and that we are going to be bl@@ am@@ assing us on the world stage .
the branches were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
there are always obstacles for over@@ coming , but He@@ ath@@ row answered every question .
as the Olympic Games is He@@ ath@@ row for many and not for individual infrastructure project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enlargement is a possibility to create up to 180@@ .000 new jobs , £ 211 billion on wit@@ ty growth and to leave a legacy of skills and employment both in both GB and GB . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has implemented a £ 11 billion infrastructure investment programme in time and budget , was chosen from the T@@ 5 - the five year in succession to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , until the T2 , which was built in the middle of the two crowded cat@@ walk around the world .
now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion to private investment .
London &apos;s games of 2012 were a great success for UK and I &apos;m confident that He@@ ath@@ row &apos;s expansion will be one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is time that we direct this Olympic spirit and create He@@ ath@@ row and create our future trade and create a legacy of skills and jobs in which England can be proud of . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in the &quot; Cat and mouse game &quot; for ad blocking ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; for companies , who earn money with On@@ line@@ age money , according to one of the software manufacturer attempts to circum@@ vent ad block@@ age , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cat and mouse &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , only two days after Facebook , Ad@@ block Plus would block a blog post , in which it told that users could update their filters in the program to block advertising in the social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook showed that his desktop page would change the coding for its advertis@@ ements , in order to verify the indication of the advertising , which is part of the advertising , to be difficult to recognise .
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to circum@@ vent new codes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a blo@@ g@@ post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her Fight are already underway since the invention of the display gli@@ ders already underway , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook is coming soon with a new solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that the world &apos;s largest company for social media has been incorporated into the fight , is a powerful indi@@ z that has become wor@@ rying for the industry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a study published by Pa@@ f@@ air and Adobe has some 200 million people , according to a study published last year ; almost four times as much as 2013 .
with 1.0@@ 3 billion active users , which access Facebook via their mobile devices , Hand@@ y@@ wer@@ ing 84 per cent of the valu@@ ations made Fac@@ ebooks .
the company doesn &apos;t have an ad block on desktop PCs , since mobile ad blocked no effect on Fac@@ ebooks Mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ agram , a speaker was shared .
advertising on Desktop PCs make a sufficiently large proportion of revenues so Facebook seems to be worth the investment of such a step .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday Facebook share that it would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ad pre@@ ference tool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to have more control over them to have targeted advertising . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday Facebook said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ad@@ blocks new filters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be wor@@ rying , because they would block content on the page , which are no advertising . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; for the users this is not a positive experience , therefore we are planning to address the problem , &quot; shared a spokes@@ man of Facebook in an e @-@ mail message .
ad block@@ ers are a bl@@ unt means why we have been focusing on developing tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences to put more control into the hands of the people .
woman in suspected suicide on Swiss Highway
the sacrifice was in the middle of the night on the free@@ way .
the police call witnesses after a woman in the early hours of the morning on Thursday during a suspected suicide by several vehicles on a motorway .
the incident happened at the A1 motorway near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
a woman caught in Dun@@ kl@@ en &quot; in an act of despair . &quot; on the road and were taken by several cars , the police said in Vau@@ d .
it is obvious that a Swiss franc in the age of 49 , which was transferred from several vehicles , including a lor@@ ries , wanted to kill himself .
she died on site yet .
several drivers have already been identified , but some are still not identified , the police told these and every voucher of the incident to sign up .
a investig@@ ative procedure was opened , which is a &quot; log@@ ical &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter shared the Le Trib@@ une de Gen@@ eve .
however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown .
was a clas@@ h avoid@@ able ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is something which the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that the driver should not be with@@ drawn .
in each of the two cases - in which a person ran in the Dun@@ kl@@ en on the highway - was decided that the drivers did not assume that a pedestrian in the middle of the night is running on the motorway as it was in the newspaper .
last year , a polic@@ eman of negli@@ g@@ ent killing was acquitted when she had a man over and killed , who was in August 2014 one night at the A1 near Pay@@ erne .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and has become un@@ conscious of the street , the court accepted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the court noted that the polic@@ eman had responded to an emergency call -- a justified way , and that the presence of a man on the road was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perfect exceptional and un@@ predic@@ table situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the judge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
anyone who has more information about the incident on Thursday near Morges , should notify the police at number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA Climate Change : Venus was once inhab@@ itable
the Venus was probably inhabited according to the projec@@ tions of a new NASA climate model .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies in NASA developed a model to explore the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms , similar to those of climate research .
the model was designed to determine whether the Venus might have had similar conditions once with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere .
scientists have previously pointed out that the slow circulation of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation indicates that the Venus could have had a thin , er@@ d@@ similar atmosphere could have had so slowly moving .
the model also lighted the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet probably pointed out more dry areas than earth , but had once enough water and ge@@ ographic vari@@ ability to host life and protective in front of ev@@ ap@@ oration .
the early Venus also benefited from a Sun which was 30 percent matter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow revolution of Venus explo@@ ded its daily basis of the sun for almost two months &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io explained in a press release . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Patrick Roy comes back as a trainer of Aval@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy came back on Thursday as a coach and Vice President of the Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che and lead to low @-@ determination law in the team .
alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noticed that the association will immediately look for a new coach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last three years I have received my duties as chief machine manager and vice president of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determin@@ at@@ eness , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have been thinking about the summer and much about it as I could improve this team to give him more depth , this it needs and to bring it to a higher level . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to achieve this , the Vision of Train@@ ers and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations must be perfectly ge@@ ared towards the organization .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he must also have a participation right with decisions that affect the performance of the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these conditions are currently not fulfilled .
Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on 23 May 2013 , thank him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; Patrick informed me about this decision , &quot; said Sak@@ ic .
we all appreciate what he did for our organisation and wish him the best for the future .
during his debut season with the Aval@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 , Roy won the winner of the League Award winner as the Best Trainer of the League .
he brought the association to 112 points and on the first place in Central vision but Colorado was beaten and missed in the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs from Minnesota and missed during each of the last two years .
the Aval@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 stamp in season 2015 @-@ 16 and fell behind the game for a second wild@@ card spot in the Western Conference by five points .
as a Hall of Fame Tor@@ wart , Roy won four Stanley C@@ ups - two songs with Montreal Can@@ adi@@ ens and the Aval@@ an@@ che .
Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ öl@@ ze again take convers@@ ations on , place strike
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the workers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; labour rights regarding the re@@ mun@@ eration for North seas will be suspended &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while all disputes are set to the table for a new round on table , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; negoti@@ ators &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group were conducted spor@@ adic platforms in the North Sea , operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wood Group as well as the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT Uni@@ ons can confirm that we have agreed to start the handling process of current pursu@@ it &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it says in a common statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will stop several full day meetings in the coming weeks , start the start next year to restart the problems .
the unions said that her last strike , who is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
this year Wood Group has reduced the rati@@ os of its contrac@@ tors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the management of the company follows a 10 percent reduction for on@@ shore contrac@@ tors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts to companies have the required space to come through the market down@@ turn .
Shell has dismissed and plans for thousands of thousands of people , and plans to impos@@ e up its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries as a result of its business activities with the UK Energy company BG Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; energy companies are under pressure due to the lower cru@@ de oil prices under pressure , an economic situation that intensi@@ fied by the decision of the British in June , the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Scottish Parliament of Parliament Dave Anderson met in the beginning of this week with workers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; workers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to discuss one of the largest labour dispute since one generation in the North Sea . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need a economy that works for many and not just a few , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion will be expected for new projects in the North Sea , compared to an average of around $ 7 billion over the last five years .
Kepler measures rotary rate of stars in the star@@ ry of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with the Kepler Space Teles@@ cope has helped Astr@@ onom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalogue on rotary rates among the stars of star@@ ry .
the new data help astronom@@ ers understand why stars in the star@@ ry can rotate at different rates as well as in which connection the rotation periods with the planet@@ arium .
&quot; we hope that we experience the compar@@ ing of our results with other star@@ ry , more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age and even the story of his solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the star@@ ry of the P@@ lei@@ ades lies 4@@ 45 light@@ years from the earth .
many stars in this constellation originated approximately 125 million years ago , now reach adul@@ thood .
they now turn on fastest .
to peak rot@@ ations , these gri@@ pping stars encounter large amounts of star@@ ters .
since these winds are travelling through the stars of the stars , they have a brake effect on the stars .
when a star is al@@ igned , its rotation rate starts to slow down .
Kepler measures the rotation rate of every ster@@ ile by recogni@@ zes the time between the appearance of a recogni@@ z@@ able star -- such as sun@@ spots -- .
the newest catalog of rotary rates indicates that mas@@ si@@ vere are more slower than less serious stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , the larger stars slower pi@@ rou@@ ettes rotate as smaller .
&quot; at the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
since the star@@ ry of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare primary qualities as rot@@ ational rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the star@@ ry of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of the stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is still much ahead of us , we would like to know more about how the How , When and Why stars can slow down their rotation rates and hang up their &quot; dance shoes . &quot;
Reb@@ ull and their colleagues have reported in detail about their latest analysis of rotary rates of the P@@ lei@@ ades , which will soon appear in the Astr@@ onom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial Bas@@ eball Star step down
at Alex Rodri@@ guez , tears ran faster than the US bas@@ eball star in the best days of base to base .
following his emotional response announcement , the 41 year @-@ old pro will carry on 12 August against T@@ ampa Bay R@@ ays a last time the tri@@ cot of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say &apos; Good@@ bye &apos; , the 14 @-@ time All @-@ Star Game participant of the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) stated .
three times Rodri@@ guez was elected to the most valuable player of the league , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es .
his signature under a tenth annual contract has held annually 27 million US dollars annually .
by the end of the contrac@@ ting on 31 December 2017 , he will serve as consultant and youth coach - at full content .
as a player , it paid Rodri@@ guez for long time with performance .
with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his team ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas Rang@@ ers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 he managed the Yan@@ ke@@ es a few milest@@ ones .
with the Hall @-@ of @-@ Fame @-@ Members H@@ ank Aaron and Willi@@ e M@@ ays show only two other bas@@ eball player in the most important statistics similar values .
but the 41 @-@ year @-@ old is not likely to be included in the Hall of the bas@@ eball hall .
because so successful Rodri@@ guez - nickname &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; - on the field was so controversial is its appearance outside the place .
in 2009 , the super@@ star at &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; announced to be banned from ster@@ o@@ ids between 2001 and 2003 .
in August 2013 , due to a processing in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ andal at the end of 2014 , he was closed for 211 games .
Rodri@@ guez is considered to be the principal suspic@@ ious for years over an anti @-@ aging clinic in South @-@ Florida funding funding .
after a law@@ suit the lock has been reduced to 162 encounters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the league could even have done one favor for the year 2014 , because I played a break for 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ guez at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even his deportation days are not silent .
while many bas@@ eball le@@ gends occupy the big stage again , Rodri@@ guez had to sit on the bench frequently .
&quot; my job does not include a deportation tour . &quot;
&quot; my job includes the attempt to win every game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ardi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , Rodri@@ guez , who was married to the actress Cameron Di@@ az and the actress Kate Hudson said , sympathy with pop star Madonna and actress Kate Hudson , sympathy of fans of the Yan@@ kee @-@ Erz@@ riv@@ alen Boston Red So@@ x .
&quot; we want a @-@ Rod &quot; to meet the followers at 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ guez team .
Olympia 2016 : Chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are the first d@@ oping fail@@ ures
because of a positive d@@ oping sample , Wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland won &apos;t start in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 will be over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed by the first official d@@ oping cases .
an experienced Ath@@ let@@ in would have won almost a medal .
the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro has become famous before the seventh race day before the seventh race day .
the Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers Chen X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter @-@ obst@@ acle in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa from Bulgaria and Polish Wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ insky have been positively tested and excluded - immediately prior to the beginning of the anyway @-@ critical athle@@ tics competition this news to the un@@ time .
on Sunday , the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ othi@@ azi@@ de was detected last Sunday , which is used as a massive means for d@@ oping substance .
the International Sports Court of CAS confirmed on Friday afternoon to her exclusion from the Olympic Games .
on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ old took the fourth place in the final over 100 m butterfly , just around 0,@@ 09 seconds , she missed the bronze medal .
on Friday , Chen would have to participate in the Pre@@ vent@@ ing over 50 m Freestyle .
Chen has requested the opening of the B @-@ Trial Chamber at the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the national association take the matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very serious and demands Chen &apos;s full cooperation with the exam@@ inations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cited X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will deal with the International Sports Court CAS and will accept the verdict . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in history this is no longer the IO@@ C , but the CAS for sanctions were responsible for athletes .
also in the night of Rio , the news of the positive rehear@@ sal at Dan@@ ek@@ owa through , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went on to the offensive .
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; this was &quot; an incredible shock , &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is innocent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated the light athle@@ tics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report , it is said to act with the banned substance for the EP@@ O blood d@@ op@@ ing@@ agent .
after B@@ NT , the B Trial was supposed to be positive , according to B@@ NT , the B Trial .
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ v was immediately referring to criticism of the Ath@@ let@@ in .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes do not pull the right shots , &quot; he said , &quot; We Bulg@@ arians have been under observation , so many have been excluded . &quot;
in this way , approximately all weight the@@ the@@ k may not be able to participate in the chron@@ ically d@@ op@@ pressed nation in Rio .
on Friday , the case of &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; was also tested by the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg , as his brother Tom@@ as@@ z has been tested positively on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid n@@ and@@ rol@@ on .
both deny the intake , both may not start in class up to 94 kg .
before the start of the athletes , Dan@@ ek@@ owa Case was another difficult blow for the reputation of the entire sport .
the IA@@ AF association had banned the entire Russian team up to an exception because of systematic d@@ oping in Kenya , the L@@ äu@@ ble Kenya has also produced numerous bad news in Rio .
in the swimming pool , the previous crimin@@ als in China had also cat@@ ered for severe disputes between the athletes .
in this way , the Fren@@ chman Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympi@@ ger Sun Yang har@@ p .
&quot; sun Yang p@@ ink@@ elt purple . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I see the podium over 200 m Freestyle , I want to pass over , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in the French radio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was also the centre of a confron@@ tation with Australian M@@ ack H@@ ort@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and respect for D@@ oping Bet@@ rü@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was positive in 2014 for the Chinese championships positive on the pac@@ ul@@ ant tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din , but had to sit only a triple lock .
dat@@ e@@ au : so per@@ fi@@ de presses their ran@@ som
program@@ mers of black@@ mailing malware use targeted companies - and are successful .
according to a recent survey by malware specialist Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes under 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of survey@@ ed firms in the last twelve months were at least once , several victims of an attack with black@@ mailing software .
in Germany , almost 20 percent of companies have already been the aim of a ran@@ som@@ ware @-@ black@@ mail .
40 percent of the victims will be re@@ adily available from the perpet@@ rators to use the challenged systems and data .
the perpet@@ rators speci@@ alize their black@@ mailing software according to the observ@@ ations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes to attacks in company networks .
if they are successful there , the potentially g@@ un@@ ting ran@@ som is significantly higher than in private users .
&quot; we &apos;re watching a terri@@ fying rapid evolution of the malware , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ boss Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; world . &quot;
in 2008 most Mal@@ war@@ e@@ programs were still designed to send advertising .
then the perpet@@ rators discovered black@@ mailing software for themselves .
only then were private users the goal , but the change to company attacks was fri@@ ghtening over the past few months .
Ran@@ som@@ ware works after an easy pattern : once on the computer of a victim , it searches for un@@ long changed files such as Word@@ - , Ex@@ cel@@ - or database files , as well as archives images and videos .
these files encryp@@ ts Ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
the software then presents the demands of the black@@ mailing .
to get the final key code to the files , the victims need money - usually in the form of Cr@@ yp@@ ad Bit@@ coin .
but where private users find the personal photo database on the game , it &apos;s about sensitive customer data or project databases , without which the production is shut down .
accordingly , the damage is damaged if a ran@@ som@@ ware does not fall .
22 percent of the affected German companies reported sales losses due to Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 per cent even had to break down the business , in a case , people were in danger of life .
in Germany , numerous hospitals were victims of attacks , whose patients could be threatened by the loss of nurse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always say the sacrifices : pay not , you only promotes the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but 80 to 90 percent of companies paying their data will get back .
for managers , it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpet@@ rators .
the h@@ ack@@ ers again know this and try to build a good reputation .
in a recent study , the safety researchers of F @-@ Secure investig@@ ates the user interfaces and the contact with the expres@@ sions and come to the result : the perpet@@ rators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money .
you agree to their sacrifices by chat as they can pay by Bit@@ coin , judge freely accessible support websites or de@@ cryp@@ t free example files .
and private people will rede@@ em by only a few hundred Euro , companies need to negoti@@ ate hard and have five @-@ digit sum@@ s to return to their data un@@ encrypted .
in view of the potentially high and relatively ris@@ ky winn@@ ings from Ran@@ som@@ ware Er@@ pres@@ ets , the h@@ ack@@ ers are always professional and share the work , explains security experts Che@@ ster Wis@@ nie@@ wski of the anti @-@ virus provider Sop@@ hos : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware by a week . &quot;
more likely , however , it is about three or four people .
the program@@ mers sell their damage software then in the form of a software construction kit to the actual black@@ mailing .
the previous malware kits were created by adding malware , advice and additional tools for a single , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
&quot; the scope of delivery includes a adap@@ table , so that smaller configur@@ ations , looks and bran@@ ding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ nie@@ wski .
the black@@ smith then search for further h@@ ack@@ ers to spread the freshly bought software under the victims .
we live in a service economy .
so , one of the forums in the underground , buys the set of a criminal and asked another to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
payment is made by a certified computer .
&quot; usually , the crimin@@ als carry sp@@ amm@@ ers with the spread , &quot; explains Wis@@ nie@@ wski .
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now known for many companies that ensure their data better .
over 50 per cent of companies in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ survey are confident that Ran@@ som@@ ware is able to stand off using a file @-@ back @-@ ups and sc@@ ann@@ er@@ software .
accordingly , the perpet@@ rators are already following new strategies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the encryption from data alone is no sufficient threat to successful savings , the perpet@@ rators instead with the release of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ boss Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this , the potential for damages is still higher than before the type of data is much higher than before .
the perpet@@ rators could also be able to remove completely new goals on the Internet of things .
at the Hack@@ er@@ conference Def@@ con demonstrate their safety researchers , as they were able to get connected to the Internet with the Internet .
in the middle of winter the activation of a der@@ art blocked heating so many victims could be worth a ran@@ som .
if the perpet@@ rators then instead of heating in the future block an entire production line in a factory , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also be a topic in Industry 4.0 .

Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and all @-@ day du@@ sty
in the Little HR @-@ V , Honda will pack everything : a little SUV , a little cou@@ pe and also the versat@@ ility of a min@@ iv@@ ans .
sounds rather over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life .
although the only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V seems small , the passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the rear .
the materials of the indoor area are well processed and enjoyable , only the cockpit tops falls out there .
the HR @-@ V is more versatile than comparable vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is not only a trunk of 4@@ 53 l available at high @-@ grade and 10@@ 26 l in the sp@@ ed back @-@ rests , but there are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is less magical when it sounds : the seat areas of the rear bench can be folded like Kin@@ os@@ es@@ sel and therefore offer storage space , which is high from the ground up to the ceiling is 1.@@ 24 m high .
the luggage boot can be loaded well , but the load height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot in 2008 .
the tested 1.6 @-@ l diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V thanks to the torque at torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed areas .
he is likely to teach his work somewhat qui@@ eter .
the daily consumption of 4.7 litres / 100 km is pleasing .
there is another engine : a 1.5 @-@ liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
the driving behaviour is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort .
the steering is expected to be a bit more direct .
the equipment is open to the tested top model &quot; Executive &quot; in the tested top model .
the City @-@ Emer@@ gency assist@@ ent is one of the security systems ( works until Tempo 32 ) , the coll@@ ision warning system and the gap assistant .
sometimes the coll@@ isions war@@ med sometimes , because he has been rated many obstacles as &quot; her@@ al@@ ous objects . &quot;
the remote driver is very reliable .
and the smart tem@@ po@@ re@@ gler is respon@@ ding to the road detection and en@@ cap@@ s@@ ates the speed .
the full connectivity makes it only for the top features : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , Nav@@ i , App integration and more .
two USB@@ - and an HDMI jack are under the arm@@ rest and therefore are therefore a bit aw@@ k@@ ward to reach .
the approximately 29@@ 000 Euro for the well @-@ equipped top @-@ diesel are fine .
if you don &apos;t want to invest so much , gasoline is starting from 20000 euros , the diesel from 23@@ 000 Euro .
the engines meet the Euro 6 emission standard .

drivers can then be directly from the hammer road on the right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the great advantage : the traffic divi@@ des early on , making the total of the main sequence on the various section of the federal highway 51 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea with the extended exit had the CDU faction in the Administ@@ rative District of Münster @-@ West .
the drivers of driving on the Zu@@ br@@ inger opened the car above all between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
week@@ days goes back to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ her way and sometimes also beyond .
the reason is the needle on the B 51 shortly before the exit Wes@@ eler street .
from here traffic only gives a trace on the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be built in a good three @-@ quarter years ago .
the reason : static calculations have shown that the bridge has no longer the required bearing capacity to absorb the heavy traffic .
how long this narrow @-@ pass and the connected per@@ au will continue , the competent court cannot say .
however , to be reck@@ oned with years , because the bridge has an official balance time by 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the legal refra@@ ction , the country has deliber@@ ately sought out s@@ lugg@@ ish time during school holidays because with disabilities .
traffic will be passed on Tuesday and Wednesday in a single lane on the building site .

rain instead of star@@ ing : hope in weather repair
the weather has made the star h@@ ubs in the southwest of Germany in the night to Friday a stroke through the bill - but there is still hope .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the night was bad for clouds and rain to observe the heavenly spectac@@ le , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chairman of the ob@@ servatory is Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , Friday morning . &quot; &quot; &quot;
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
the weather should be good , then we &apos;ll see many star@@ ving stars in the sky .
with the star@@ dom , it is Per@@ pet@@ ing that belong to the fastest star@@ ters with 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour .
they have their names because they apparently come from the constellation Per@@ se@@ us , which is in the northeast .
relaxing night : tips for sleeping disorders
in the evening , you walk forever at night , while at night it is awake for hours , in the morning you can no longer think of sleep anymore .
this is all other than relaxing .
after all , one is with such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about one quarter of adult sleep problems and more than ten per cent emp@@ i@@ ously find their sleep often or permanent .
how do sleeping problems or sleep problems ?
there are several forms of sleep problems , and there are various causes underlying them , emphas@@ izes Hans @-@ Günter We@@ e@@ ß , member of the board of the German Society for Schla@@ ff@@ ing and Sle@@ ep Medicine .
whatever you under@@ stands , but the in@@ som@@ nie , thus , is an in@@ som@@ atic and a sleep problem .
just the sleep emp@@ ires many people find as uns@@ at@@ is@@ factory or in@@ adequate , says Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht , member of the German House medical association with practice in the Lower Sax@@ on Var@@ el .
what &apos;s behind sleep problems ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
behind this , organic , mental or behavi@@ our@@ al factors can , but also have medicines .
not rarely is the in@@ som@@ atic expression of another disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early awakening is especially frequent with depression , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says We@@ e@@ ß . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it can be that different factors deserve each other .
those who have a her@@ ni@@ ated disc , can lie badly , w@@ akes up every two to three hours and always cat@@ ches to p@@ onder@@ ous about everyday problems and care , gives We@@ e@@ ß an example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
when should I sleep with sleep problems ?
if you do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week , should be affected by the doctor , We@@ e@@ ß says .
the imp@@ air@@ ment can look quite different : it is ab@@ hor@@ red , tired , unable to sleep , has difficulty with attention and concentration , has trouble @-@ fluctu@@ ations or physical problems such as stomach or head@@ aches .
to prevent sleep distur@@ b@@ ance , it is important to find out their causes .
as treatment options , behavi@@ oral changes , cognitive Behavi@@ oral therapy or medicines - classic sleeping pills just in case of emergency and maximum for two weeks - in@@ quire .
there are hardly any sleeping medicine in Germany , emphas@@ izes Prof. Ingo Fi@@ etz@@ e , head of the Inter@@ disciplinary Medical Center of Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin .
that is why one should contact with sleeping problems first to the house@@ physician , We@@ e@@ ß says .
this can clari@@ fy with exam@@ inations , whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to sleep laboratory , and what happens ?
for example , in case of sleep laboratory medical , for example , snor@@ ing with respir@@ atory refle@@ x@@ ies , in case of disease injury or if one cannot find the cause of a c@@ resc@@ ence , Fi@@ etz@@ e explains .
you don &apos;t have to prepare for the test .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; please do not make a lunch sleep , &quot; Fi@@ etz@@ e says .
after the wired one goes to bed at its normal time .
in addition to the electro@@ des in the body , one is wearing a nas@@ al s@@ ung@@ lasses , a chest strap and a ant@@ enn@@ ler .
in addition , a camera is drawing to the ceiling on the ceiling .
how can we get the problems in the handle ?
there are quite many positions , where you can set for a better sleep .
We@@ e@@ ß counts on : regular sleeping and stopping times , not to sleep long in bed , do not sleep on the day , not watch TV for sleeping , alcohol avoid the day and not to watch at night - and that &apos;s all at all right .
what the jungle camp with missing medals in swimming
the former German s@@ wimm@@ ers Markus D@@ ei@@ bler sum@@ med himself up with Facebook to dis@@ ap@@ point the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 he had brought gold for the first time world championships in Doha and set up his first world record at the same time .
now the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ let Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has placed himself against his ex @-@ te@@ amm@@ ates in the criticism of his criticism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in one country , in which an Olympic Champion receives 20,000 € award and a Dsch@@ ig@@ ot kö@@ nig 150,000 € , no one should wonder about lack of medals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the 26 year old at night on his Facebook page . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the water convey@@ ing system is bad , but the d@@ oping controls are very good .
we cannot compete with countries that promote a lot of encour@@ aging and do not know exactly at the subject of d@@ oping , or even operate it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls are to be termin@@ ated here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he wanted to start com@@ eback , D@@ ei@@ bler would have to be reported nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( NA@@ DA ) .
you should also keep it with countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who cannot be controlled a certain time before World Cup / OS by independent Controll@@ ers of WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A must not participate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Hamburger Hamburger , who meanwhile operates an ice cream . &quot; &quot; &quot;
airport : banana from Bag@@ di@@ vines
professional Die@@ be at the Düsseldorf Airport
civil rights of Düssel@@ dor@@ fer police managed on Thursday the arrest of two women and two men aged 50 to 61 years .
the susp@@ ect had committed numerous bags and luggage poles .
at 21.@@ 30 a.m. , civil servants found a gang back in the area of the airport Düsseldorf , which was known to the polic@@ emen from past theft .
the two women and two men had committed several del@@ icacy since mid July of this year and were in common , working and particularly professional .
the experts of the Krimin@@ al@@ kom@@ ari@@ ats 34 can prove the Die@@ ben who had travelled to Germany specifically for off@@ beat off@@ ences to Germany .
in total , they explo@@ ited more than 15.000 Euro .
old buildings , a few len@@ ghts , in between still another head pav@@ ement : the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain works at first glance not so , but the police is one of the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
if you walk along the road from east to west , one gets past games , a freshly painted kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ades .
to the facade of a grey house somebody &quot; ugly ! &quot; spra@@ yed .
compared to a Li@@ dl which will soon be demolished , it will already be built : until 2017 a house with high windows and 133 new apartments are expected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; article about this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trendy neighborhood &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as the responsible real estate company Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain , however , are preferred by burning cars in recent weeks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was busy , the occup@@ ying contracts , on the ground floor , are still occupied spaces and are used for events .
especially the Berlin interior designer , in particular , since the beginning of the year , he pronounced repeatedly for a hard lead by the police against the project as &quot; No @-@ Go Zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence .
after 22 June the rooms were cleared out on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schm@@ ie@@ de , with 300 police officers , had pat@@ ro@@ amed the police for three weeks with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site , sper@@ sed parts of the road and held visitors to enter the house with the number 94 .
in the meantime , renovated building workers on behalf of the unknown home@@ owners .
on 13 July , a Berlin administrative district decided that the clearance had been illeg@@ ally , and one day later the police and building workers moved under the youth of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents .
on this summer afternoon the road seems peaceful : parents walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others are talking about Sp@@ ät@@ i .
in the immediate vicinity of the hood projects there are an elementary school and nur@@ ser@@ y .
left violence is not the main or@@ ge of many local residents : K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in Kiev since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , which are largely composed by three children , are mainly driven by the police presence .
with the inhabitants of the skin projects they share the concern ahead of increasing r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication .
it does not sound like a pine , which sm@@ ashed out multiple police protection against v@@ andal@@ ous left .
the tren@@ ch , which the Berlin inter@@ c@@ ator and police force between domestic workers and their neighbours , does not exist yet .
Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working service , which also has a lower average of average and high risk of poverty in comparison to the rest of the city .
also houses and native projects have long been to Kiev : in 1990 , numerous houses in the former GDR were occupied , including almost the entire Main@@ zer street in the vicinity of the Rig@@ a@@ er .
while the Main@@ zer has been evacu@@ ated under large police force in a real street battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Rig@@ a@@ er and are still inhabited by people who had occupied them 26 years ago .
at the same time , the city &apos;s district has become increasingly difficult for tourists and const@@ ern@@ ers from all over the world , with them local residents from GDR times and former home @-@ occup@@ ants are sharing their jaw .
this is also noticeable for the rent , which has risen by almost 60 percent since 2009 .
many of the new@@ builds in the Rig@@ a@@ er are attacked as symbols for this development : you recognize it on the raised slices or freshly painted Fa@@ ç@@ ades that were captured with paint bags .
no other road was mentioned so often together with the words &quot; left @-@ autonomous violence . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one reason that not all neighbors could be seen as a problem , that they are not strictly affected by crime : crimes such as bodi@@ ly injury , according to statistics , almost exclusively against polic@@ emen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the largest part of the off@@ ences make objec@@ tions , which tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses .
for K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives for 17 years in a rental house next to the controversial 94 , there can be no talk of un@@ certainty .
as far as they are concerned , they are important : the people in the 94 are their neighbours who were not meant to be .
even the famous burning cars I don &apos;t give it directly in the Rig@@ a@@ er anymore .
for the studied architecture in architecture , her road is not a criminal focal point , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps each other , lives together on the road and gets more from each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is deliber@@ ately drawn into the Rig@@ a@@ er Street - and stayed .
this is why it was so important that local residents got their way back : from police , politics and media , which suddenly claimed the interpretation of the area in July .
however , in the eyes of residents such as Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road continues to leave them : separated new buildings in former construc@@ ts that displ@@ ace old residents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are ultimately con@@ domin@@ iums , which are not interesting for many people - here are people who are not so well cared for &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violence and destruction I can absolutely not gu@@ ide@@ ate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what should one do if someone is never listening to anyone ?
there is fru@@ stration at all sides , even with the police and the residents .
for dra@@ gging about colour bombs , K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the hood projects and the left scene belonged to the Kie@@ z .
who moves , should be aware of it - just like someone who moves in a pub area to complain badly about noise .
all persons displayed only with first names have to be asked to be called by their proper name
Ur@@ bach : An@@ ni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is new refugee bud@@ sman
An@@ ni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is the contact partner in the integration and organizer .
it is also a social worker locally .
An@@ ni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee bud@@ sman for Ur@@ bach since July .
the social ped@@ agog@@ y supports the team of administration around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
she looks as a contact partner for all actors : refugees , working group refugee aid , administration , authorities and those else involved .
Reg@@ ine client of working group indicates that the volunteers are more than thank@@ ful that D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is now that the mat@@ uring Woll@@ mil@@ ky , which primarily has a problem .
so some - less spar@@ king than rather than the multitude of desired tasks are purpos@@ ely meant - meant as the management wanted to write the place .
the management expert was chosen by a talent for languages and people , associated with a long @-@ term experience in the field of social work , an ei@@ ving wool mel@@ chs@@ au .
but administrative work is not its central area , An@@ ni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le means .
above all , it is about organization , working with people on site and also behind the scenes and network activity .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been working for about six weeks .
it has a 50 percent point on three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was high time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer that An@@ ni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le and main actors support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are big and small problems , organis@@ ational , human and understanding problems .
new containers are soon available in the water@@ way .
a serious problem has been to be found for some time , apartments for connecting wings , which have been recognized .
the mun@@ icipalities are responsible for connecting the connections .
they need to place refugees in their own or hired living rooms .
the costs for the construction , rent or the renovation of these accommodations must bear the mun@@ icipalities themselves .
responsibility is changing from the land @-@ rats to Commun@@ e and Job@@ center .
problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been very difficult for some time .
de facto the administration is not found private apartments .
so far , it does not work so far to rely on private apartments so D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le .
therefore , common homes must be er@@ ect as it is so beautiful .
so soon new containers are installed in the water@@ way .
but only with homes it is not done .
pro@@ spect is the keyword , Reg@@ ine customer and An@@ ni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le agree .
in addition to a firm lead , there are internship plac@@ ements , training places , one @-@ euro jobs and hel@@ pers for refugees and migrants who have to be t@@ iled or set up .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; said Reg@@ ine Customer .
many work in the building yard or help home master , attend char@@ itable work - and that motiv@@ ates and very tidy , as An@@ ni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le reports .
she hopes the work for the church leads to a positive impact .
that is &quot; no employment therapy . &quot;
but activity does not mean work .
the tag need a fixed structure , say D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le and customer .
people would have to develop a fe@@ asi@@ bility experience .
so there are offers like sport , contacts with locals , and especially in language courses .
professional courses are rare .
so here administrative and honorary citizens are jumping .
it is central that the refugees are feeling that they are welcome and welcome them in Germany .
the long duration of the process is a problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they must explain the refugees that it takes just and they can bridge the time sense , for example with language courses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
who sometime feel the feeling that he can &apos;t help in Ur@@ bach nobody can work and be unn@@ üt@@ z , who will never in@@ corporate .
the clear majority is motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but problem cases are also honest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people who don &apos;t know anything about them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the work of D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always willing to motiv@@ ate others . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all this is already a &quot; mamm@@ oth task . &quot;
a difficult question : have the two fear of radic@@ alization , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; no , &quot; says Reg@@ ine client quite clearly , &quot; what some nai@@ ve may call &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; a remaining risk can and doesn &apos;t want to exclu@@ de them out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are sensiti@@ zed .
these inci@@ dents are also subject to refugees .
they would have fear that the assass@@ inations took them completely in call .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with that , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer .
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so , main and volunteer work must take place in the region and in the region .
they always have in the background that a new Sto@@ ß could come to refugees and migrants to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a limit ?
to answer this question clearly , the politics .
actually , it is un@@ fair to place them hel@@ pers on site .
&quot; in Ur@@ bach , we are not there yet , where we want to go , &quot; says An@@ ni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le .
no new refugees , that would be able to relax .
Reg@@ ine customer also clearly makes sure that the Ur@@ g@@ bacher are al@@ igned to em@@ bed the previous people reasonable .
these are currently around 100 people , mostly young men .
but when people are in need , they must help them both are women .
the political world situation is so complicated , there is no simple answers .
chim@@ ney : bur@@ gl@@ ar with helicopter sought
the police helicopter flew various areas around one hour - un@@ successful .
two unknown men are ra@@ ped on Friday morning at 8.50 am in an apartment in a multi @-@ family house in the Lin@@ den@@ weg .
the residents surprised the two and beat the un@@ b@@ ump@@ y into the escape .
the two men were about 1.@@ 65 to 1.@@ 70 meters tall , probably mas@@ ked , carried both Blue@@ je@@ ans and black hoo@@ ded pul@@ lis .
they wing@@ ed towards downtown .
the police replaced several police posts and a police helicopter .
the f@@ lap went without success .
perhaps the unknown was , in fact , near the apartment , or on their escape .
