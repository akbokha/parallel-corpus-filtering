<seg id="3">The two US presidential applicants are, however, in the tax and energy policy, as well as in a fundamental question.</seg>

<seg id="8">He himself would be completely different, claiming Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">He will be attributed to regulators, and he makes himself strong tax reform with lower tax sets strong - for private people and companies.</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton said: the state has certain jobs, he has disadvantaged opportunities to open and needs money.</seg>
<seg id="11">Therefore, taxes for the rich will increase, she says.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the shots invests, trump and Clinton say almost the same.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate is announcing the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in the infrastructure are classical democratic policies and are rejected by the state-critical teapy wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">So on Trump, we could still get parted internal discussions.</seg>
<seg id="17">More clearly are the differences in energy and climate policies.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and rebuild the coal conveying in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil extraction should also be possible in previously protected areas, which wants to terminate the Paris climate deal.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "Clinton wants to strengthen the renewable energies with its investment programme:" "" "a country will create the superpower of clean energies and create millions of jobs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want we are." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only during the infrastructure - even in international trade agreements the two competitors are not too far from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transpazifish trade agreement, both don't want to sign.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "" "" "at the same time, both the US don't want to isolate the international trade - but simply protect American jobs." ""</seg>
<seg id="25">They should then be paid better, Clinton for Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7.25 US dollars is a starvation wages.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to raise it to 15 dollars a hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "what trump wants to do in this question is not clear: once he says:" "" "the minimum wage must be rinsed," "" "he says he must not be changed." ""</seg>
<seg id="29">However, the big discussion of the coming months is likely to continue to develop the tax policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "" "" "on one page stands trump, who wants to discharge the economy and citizens to boost growth." ""</seg>

<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are winged.</seg>

<seg id="29">And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.</seg>
<seg id="30">Who believe that the end, as soon as they arrived in Germany, irre, tells bahr.</seg>
<seg id="31">Here too many women in refugees were often considered inferior and worse.</seg>
<seg id="32">This leads to about 90 percent of women who live in the housing in the North of Munich, they are traumatised.</seg>

<seg id="40">In Schwaben alone, women are not accommodated separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, Pressespreach of the government.</seg>
<seg id="41">In Oberbayern, sub-Franconia, there are only two floors or their own houses only for single women and their children.</seg>

<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "" "" "the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to proclaim the hands and proclaim an official end of eight months of the words and economic sanctions." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish contragamer in the gilded hall of St. Petersburg Palastes in reception, I cannot interfere with the penetration that Ankara wants to be the reconciliation of the most.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the rash, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin took dirty smile, and he had little warmth, even for his restrained circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "on the other hand, Recep Tayyip Erdogan said repeatedly about his" "" "friend" "" "Putin - according to a report all five times." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan would have heard so would be something bad.</seg>
<seg id="11">To me, his enthusiasm seemed rather the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one out of Putin was radiant, sustainable audited that Russia had forgotten the President of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first, which he mentioned in his quotes: the shooting of a Russian fighter aircraft at the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was turbulent.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin shared out and accused Ankara, Russia in the back.</seg>
<seg id="16">The leaving was even greater, as it was done by an supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Vetroen rebuild is difficult, if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">During the month, the government controlled media had a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">Suddenly it seemed as if the Turks would bear to blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "at the most serious were the accusations from senior citizens who would have benefited their own family from illegal oil trading in the regions of Syria, which will be controlled by the so-called Islamic State." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">He denied this vehement.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, this meeting took place just because Putin received the excuse to listen to the President Erdogan.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the benefits of truce is clear on the hand.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan is primarily necessary to get all friends who can get after the last month of a failed coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are economic motives as well.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit hard against Turkey - especially the ban on batches, which usually take several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has declined by nearly 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when the flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late-seasonal onslaught of the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week the state television predicted cheap fruits and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed.</seg>
<seg id="35">A report in Vedemosti formulated it as follows: "tourists there long, tomatoes here long."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is angry at the west, as its response to the attempted power transmission was considered a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "the prolonged Groll on the accession talks of the EU accession talks and Putin - the pioneer thereon is to benefit from the cool mood and decrease Turkey's relationship to the West." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">In Ankara, the Russian leader won a bonus for him that after the attempted coup d "état, he demanded support for the elected state organs.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is well known for Moscow, self-understanding that even has a deep fear of regimes.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "the summit meeting in this glittering palace on the sea made it possible in Russia and Turkey, a" "" "outsider" "" "an analyst," "" "two countries who violate themselves from the West and feel badly treated and now allied." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite the public propitiation, there are still great differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "" "" "the biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave the role as a peace maker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing parties." ""</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be pointed out that after almost three hours of first conversations, both presidents on the press conference had said that they had not even striped the subject.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "Turkey quitted it intentionally to answer a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize these." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus about where a common denominator to Syria can be found.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potentials for a perfect disaster, when NATO member Turkey shoss the Russian combat jet - it is certainly better that the two heads will talk at least again.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russian Putin is feud of Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov</seg>
<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin relieved his Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov.</seg>
<seg id="3">IVANOV was a part of the narrowful trust of Putin for many years.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old was appointed the Special Representative for environmental and transport purposes.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "in a statement of the Kremlin it is that Putin ordered" "" "dismissal Ivanovs by his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential system." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who was a deputy since 2012, was named after his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born 1972 in the Estonian capital of Tallinn, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Tokyo Embassy.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the website of the Kremlin it is called Russian (in Russian) that he later was the head of log and Chief of the government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "he said to Putin on his appointment," "" "thank you for your trust." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as head of government regarding bills and inspections to implement your instructions." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his position and advised Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Convince the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made mysterious incidents.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergey Ivanov was a long time that Vladimir Putin's engaging trusts and works as he works for the Soviet secret services, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin, who was broadcasted on TV, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff returns to his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smile for the cameras, only few of them are convinced - especially in front of the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So here is the result of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows that.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official assertion - that a man who once was aspared as a potential president who wants to lead Russian environmental policy - pushed to great skepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks on Putin, who are quoted on the website of the Kremlin, Ivanov said it is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012, I almost say this very complicated post - one could almost say - descriptive post for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian President for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV accepted the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and how Putin is a member of the KGB State Security Service.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was Chairman of the Bundessional Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov as one of five people, whom he trusted.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once it was believed that Ivanov could lead to Putin's second term president of Russia as a third term of Putin would violate the Constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another, close allies Putin's ally, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin was Prime Minister before he became President for three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the failure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that require extremely precise tolerances for fit.</seg>

<seg id="17">This was a massive and very delicate activity.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunting trip to health and happiness that pays off</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to watch how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">That teenagers and child don't go out to play anymore, but rather prefer to spend their free time to spend their free time on screens, was sued by many in the last decade.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about to get people from the sofa and to be more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The screen was initially limited to the TV, then on video games and at least on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">Therefore, it is great to see that technology and activities did not exclude each other outdoors.</seg>
<seg id="7">I pray you, of course, based on the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters that were created first for video games in the 1990s (later they created a animation series, playing cards and other spin-off).</seg>
<seg id="8">As many phenomena of pop culture sunk the interest in the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand in early July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was postponed by massive demand that overload the server.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days, Pokémon Go is more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, the players will go outside with their smartphone outside and search for Pokémons, who can be followed with a GPS and as soon as they were found, "photographed" (about a screenshot on the phone) or "captured."</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the track and jumped for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the US, the game resulted in a considerable increase in steps that puts the "average" person every day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiac, an app for Apple Watch that followed 35,000 users, the Washington Post recently distributed that within two days after the launch of the game, the number of people followed by 45 percent to 53 percent each day.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company doesn't know who plays Pokémon Go - it just sees the raw data for improving performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "many public reconnaissance campaigns for health, people want to bring" "" "to be active" "" "to be active" "" "on deaf ears" "", "because many public messages come up to health and come from people who look like." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sports may not be assessed.</seg>
<seg id="19">Those who regularly drive sports, reduces his chances of developing cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps with weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes, and a long list of benefits that is too long to introduce them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful on Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that it is fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Three pillars of health will be covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine, as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people go hunting even new friendships.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always there is mürrical play corrupt, which must always complain about anything.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could run against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What is it supposed to do?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has taken a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if smartphone apps like Fitbit earlier our activity, they gave us no reason to play sports as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and make use of time.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I propose to me among the women's olympiamannie and that is more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First of all, I've been with each summer olympiade since 1984 and the USA had never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And secondly, this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, inspiring for many young girls from other skin colour.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jewin is and Madison Kocian, the Catholics, complete, makes everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the United States.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and hispanic women presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">During the last four years, the number one was an Afro-American woman.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year, Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2 were.</seg>
<seg id="10">That shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">In the last Olympic Games Gabby Douglas made a surprising Olympic champion and America.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the incredible achievement of the triple world champion in Simone Bales, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as she unexpected, but masterful Gymastikroutines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday, Simone was the fourth, heterosexual American woman who won gold at an individual event event for women.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We do not experience the top of this sport, but we don't see gyms around the country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie struck all the same way as Aly and Madison, to create it into the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "they are the" "" "Last Five" "", "because the next Olympic team is only four gymnasts in the team. furthermore, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainee." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality looks so that Turns will be an expensive sport and Turner at first line in private gym, which will be maintained by parents, which will be maintained for the training, retail, travel and hotel costs (for the trainer and their Turner and families).</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these gyms are in wealthy suburbs, which can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs, Turner will receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment to families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainee of Laurie Hernandez, both have trained their athletes since they started with the tower.</seg>
<seg id="22">We need to offer municipalities Aun countless, young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, become a better and easily accessible gym training.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my gym for 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">During my events we have offered free and affordable Turnes in Harlem for more than 15.000 urban youth (especially black and hispanic) and trained national and international victors.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September, we will expand to Detroit (my home town) to offer the youth high quality gymnastics that make the opportunity to learn from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Turnes develops strength, flexibility and coordination for body as well as hard work, discipline and determinateness for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers life-long benefits for health and education and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team who will bring thousands of young girls to be interested in the gymnasts and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to take part in the sport, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this true representation of "Girl Power" by the Holes of the Olympic team golds and thank you so many young girls are motivated to start their way to start healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="8">Fortunately, nothing left what he leaked, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr Wright has been known to test the resistance of his intestine by travelling through the world, and ate peculiar as well as wonderful things.</seg>

<seg id="2">Seltsy Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals get nothing from the summer campaign with - and the tourists from North Rhine-Westphalia must not choose the country's day.</seg>
<seg id="3">They understood in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.</seg>
<seg id="4">By 2021, the country code will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays, the heavy parliament decided at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">For so far as far as it does not work: summer holidays, heat and dagerial struggle - that bites itself.</seg>
<seg id="6">The natives, who are convinced by the fighters, are on vacation.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most tourists who are in the country are on the way to Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee are not a locals, so you may not choose the country's day.</seg>
<seg id="8">These are practical problems: among the vacations are helpers who inflate posters, flyers, flyers and count them at the end of the vote, just tired.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until September 4, 2016, the election and last holiday day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern once again has to pass over the people over the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase, if you can say that, has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it is also about something: Prime Minister, Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD / CDU coalition, must be afraid of his office.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly within the CDU behind the CDU.</seg>
<seg id="13">Exciting is cut off, as strong newcomer AFD and what remains at the end of coalition.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years of age and head of government since 2008, makes an almost unremarkable election campaign, one sees from its large posters.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels through the land, spread roses and chunkses a little with the people, like it did his legendary 'wordsearch predecessor Harald Ringstorff.</seg>
<seg id="16">Otherwise, soul has got cold feet, and Angela Merkel gives the guilt the guilt of the AFD.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "their refugee policy, you" "" "We create this" "" "have accelerated the rise of the spspopuists, which will probably cost him this beautiful ministry." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The CDU with its top candidate, the Minister Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is when you make a false time at the right place.</seg>
<seg id="19">She has been invited to major German chancellor Angela Merkel twice; Merkel of the German parliamentary circle is in the northeast.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the target group did not agree, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Mecklenburg.</seg>

<seg id="23">Otherwise, the North East-CDU abstain largely on market sites and shopping malls with umbrellas and air balloon.</seg>
<seg id="24">This means Kokert, plays only a "subordinate role."</seg>
<seg id="25">The Union, too, has noted that on the country, it rained the base that they must become very strict, to find a wire back to the people.</seg>
<seg id="26">You are on the left, the SPD, the Greens, hardly available in the borders of the country.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "however, the Council of the CDU class coded to his co-electors:" "" "you have to go there where it hurts where people are: Dorffest, Golden Weddings, any birthday party needs to be used." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Because much on the game, Sellering has called for its SPD to a particularly committed campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">In polls the Social Democrats last with 22 percent behind partners (25) and only slightly ahead of AFD (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">In the election of 2011, the SPD had still won 3,5,6 percent prior to the CDU (22).</seg>
<seg id="31">The Greens, Kleinpartei with seven percent in the polls, will probably create the jump in the country day.</seg>
<seg id="32">They make a modern virtue of your holidays, and make their election, most of them on the Internet.</seg>

<seg id="9">Since the construction site passed on Monday to the south, and also the lock of the Aspergroad in Ofandingen has been lifted and also the connection to Rottenburg was restored, the traffic situation within the resort has relaxed.</seg>

<seg id="12">"" "" "" "there were some considerable problems," "" "says the Chief Executive Director of the Refurbishment Director Florian King." ""</seg>
<seg id="13">The local residents of Bachar Road, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise, because many creators were looking for and rather their Navi trusted as the signs.</seg>
<seg id="14">What led to that some trucks in residential areas are twisted.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because the speed limiting have not been observed, the assembly increases the measurement vehicle from Mössingen.</seg>
<seg id="16">"there were considerable convictions," says King, who made himself a location about the situation.</seg>

<seg id="21">Business people don't like to look at the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">But that the B 27 refurbishment has led to them too low in sales, everyone lets you ask, through.</seg>

<seg id="35">If I had a company with 4000 employees and half had been dismissed, the policy would have reacted differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, President Jörg Schmidt received a request from Göhner if there would be a financial compensation, the restaurant also benefited from the advantages of the location on the B 27. now they also have the drawbacks that surrender to the refurbishment.</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows from other land circles, where something was more generous.</seg>
<seg id="38">With all suits, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue.</seg>
<seg id="39">After all, family business has been settled since 1715, he refers to the long history.</seg>
<seg id="40">That other regulars are now less often referred to because of the complicated traffic guidance, it can understand.</seg>
<seg id="41">If you can't drive, it's also somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="42">After the end of the rehabilitation work, Göhner has no doubts about it.</seg>
<seg id="43">Despite the crises of BSE and a bird flu, Göhner holds the effects of the B 27 construction work on its customers for the biggest crisis that his inn has experienced in many years of history.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination platters: who are actually buying records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men's middle age love records.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you rush to comment in order to oversowed it under the pseudonym of non-alleviation age, this statement is derived from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the widely spoken regeneration of records is not due to a boom in millennials that would like to welcome the news of physical objects but in Midlife-nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who have bought a record recently, are all likelihood according to the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most likely number of buyers.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a horror by Hobbies - it has an emotional meaning: older turnaround kept their feelings rather for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it alone to spend time (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But are the results of Yougov?</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "if this blog would be a news report on TV, I'd pass the camera during a busy road in Soho, a modest hoe suit, before I keep standing, my hands hold and somewhat ambiguity as:" "" "so let's take a close look at it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even though the Heart Sohos moves slowly to its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill up the buildings where once independent seller were based - there are still a handful of fantastic record shops.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to disable the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind through observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I went from sister Ray (number of: two young women, three men middle age) into Reckless Records (data number: eight men's middle age, a woman, probably around the 20), is a day long because of a meeting in London and walks through the shops to fill some hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I wonder?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess," he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4.000 plates.</seg>
<seg id="17">This records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I'm not following him), dress the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles, is the result of its available income: he is now able to buy records, which he could not afford to buy, when he sold, when he was young and pleite.</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy, are out of the late 60s, early '70s, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I thought to have something too young to buy them," he says.</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees to those who buy records, rather introverted and happily spend alone time, and add: "I smoke not and I don't drink much.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my truck.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25 who works with Sister Ray, also believes that many customers who meets the Yougov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, he has noticed a new wave of people who have influenced by the media, people who have heard about comeback and get started to buy their old records.</seg>
<seg id="24">Of the conversations I have led, people usually have been drafted into their collection by 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom to trailers of a particular age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a shop like phonica in order to recognize that record shops offers a soothing community of equality.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to WEZ, some of the older customers participated in the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans are overwhelmed by the digital world and want to cover the stability of familiar sound-platen, from objects that watch happy jugenderings.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "I think sometimes it can be the colt of a void or possession of material possessions than a kind of consolation," "" "said WEZ." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">It is a collector, so I think it is so many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal with spiritually.</seg>
<seg id="34">"we are like their social workers!" flutes a staff from a turnout stack.</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey of ICM revealed in April that almost 50% of the people who bought a record last month they haven't listened.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found that 41% have a record player, whom they never use while 7% of those who buy a plate, don't have a record player.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report I would probably look very worried, while I leaflets through a stack of Bossa Nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works at sounds of the Universe (data: three men middle aged) has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the Revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"" "" "" "someone came in only here and said," "" "I have no record player, but I would like to buy a radio record, so that I can put them in the shelf." "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a great percentage, but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More product heavy, less playing music.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I have no turntables."</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older who come out slowly.</seg>
<seg id="44">So Fopp, who has dedicated the soundboard almost a whole floor, has a little audience than I purest.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around 70, tourists who make photos, Teenagers and women's middle age.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even though the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beasts of latest synthesizers and expert pop instead of experimental jazz dryfish from the loudspeakers - it is good to see such diversity among customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks very lonely, but brand psychic traumata are difficult to determine when one stands next to somebody for 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, runs around in the business for several minutes and considers the variety of the panels available for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It rather makes a shop bumper than a big purchase.</seg>
<seg id="50">She doesn't deserve a lot, so collecting boards cannot be real option, she says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It is easy to listen to music from a computer or in other way, but the beauty of records is... "it drives with a scorching sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record-lovers: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I admit the ticket, the jeans hotter, I observe a group of young teenager people who want to group for a moment around polaroid cameras, before a father and his daughter is superior to buy a Crosley turntables.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left there is a staircase, a wall full of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential boards for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">No one sees them - maybe because they are purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch it.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering the fact that every attraction for these items mean more money for the industry and could send some customers to the depths of Sohos to more, there is nothing to complain.</seg>
<seg id="60">"" "" "" "it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money as others, even that is the most important for luxury objects like boards." ""</seg>
<seg id="61">Even if my research fellow would agree that the results of Yougov, leave them, at least in record shops in Soho, which exist in reality, record shops and in Onlineforen, not considered.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They spend their Thursday morning with safety, not with the stroll through the bumps of the Berwick Street and the leaves by plates, while they master the uncanny eye of a haunted, 30-year-old moderator scouraged over the shoulders of nothing.</seg>

<seg id="2">The impressive performance in Britain during the 7-year rugby came to a ruptly stop in the final hurdle in the form of Fijis when they were defeated at a result of 43-7 in the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji bestowed a master class in the handling, side-stepping, backrest, line and routing strength to win gold - their first Olympic champion of any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was won by the not too bad trophy of the silver medal - Britain's fourth day - and they could be very proud of their efforts in that tournament in which they struck New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The clear defeat of the bucks, 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day could fall on them in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But on this form, Fiji had put a 15-man team in top shape in this form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a consolation for GB - but it is probably not - that at least one Brit tomorrow will have a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: Fijis Head trainer Ben Ryan, the former chief of England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult way behind.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago, they are lost under Ryan every game with the Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here it is just one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This stage will hurt, but progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji began wonderfull and let the GBs come out of fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co. an, one would run in driving buses. the World Series winner went 5-0 to the top, as Osea Kolinisau near the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With four minutes of play, Jerry Tuwai added another attack on the right corner, which he walked.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB barely picked up the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A heaviary valley from Mitchell stopped the mountain of Sierra Leone Nakarawa got a third gate, but it only got up on Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute Jasa Veremalua in the right corner reaches a touch down and it stand 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new one since the resurrecy and there was still more than a minute playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou preceded by further weak Tacklings of the GB Team and stormed up to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to the break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is as if Fiji was born to play the 7, while GB still approves.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is that way.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB introduced basic changes to half-time and concluded the fijian gap... for whole four minutes which was good for the conditions of the first half-time, until Joshua Tuisova went through to a brilliant interim play of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started an attempt on GB, made a touch down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game was already long in favour of the South-catarists whose fans sang, flags flying, and danced on the tribune.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame made the i-bag with another attempt in the last seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The fiff rang out, the fijis hugged and the GB scraped down in the grass.</seg>
<seg id="28">Early on the day Fiji Japan had conquered Japan in semifinals with 20-5 defeat and Britain displaced South Africa in a snap-finalmatch from the race - Britain's transformation of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown brought the bucks in the first half, but Dan Norton broke through the line with an impressive foot work and scored a gate under the post in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliantly late Tackling Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-seaside team secured the win - and thus the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="4">Even if there were only those who sat at the helm, there were three voices in the boat. the Echo of the trainer Robin Williams, was allpresent to the second Olympic champion in a row without tax woman, the first women in the history of British Sports, which put on such a scale.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their dominance was absolutely, after all of her 39.8 unarmed action, which is also unparalleled.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant athlets that glides over the surface with the elegance of pigs, which is not reflected by the art of the Triumphal Arch.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind every gold in the rowing, a battalion is to contribute to the incremental progress, which make the difference and it was no one more comfortable than the coach who would not survive this day when he was diagnosed with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said, he riseth what risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer, which is operable and they did.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not, it spreads everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been quite a bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a bit the view.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio were lucky that he could be the treatment of early 2014, out of season, could begin what the interruption kept to a minimum if this is at all the correct term in such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so it soon had to go better again soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in the hospital and ran around at the station - 20 feet, 30 foot, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough.</seg>
<seg id="18">So it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "the rowing on itself is already a challenge, but that makes it a bigger one." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "in the inconvenience of victory their first thoughts became Williams, who spent a nervenous morning so much more than otherwise to speak and tried to process his own fears." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "Stanning, who was called Captain in the Royal Artillery regiment in Afghanistan," "" "I was this week an emotional wreck. that's perhaps a bit extreme, but it means so much." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">It is only what it means to me, how much I and Helen and also Robin worked.</seg>
<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin, we wouldn't be a massive thanks to him. he is the best coach of the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">I wouldn't have a better person to trainer or a better trainer.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning lost no race in the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The pair had a hard rhythm, with which their opponents couldn't keep up.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even in the last 500 meters, when the teams started from New Zealand and Denmark, Stanning and Glover had too much to reserve.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were very imprisoned at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">Helen called "stay in the process, remain in the process."</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important to let not get involved.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we weren't looking forward to doing something rabies.</seg>
<seg id="33">We wanted no fireworks today, we just wanted to achieve a good result, go out and win the race, what we did.</seg>
<seg id="34">The couple will take a year for a year before making decisions about his future.</seg>
<seg id="35">Glover has to appear next week on a wedding, their own with the TV adventurer Steve Backshall.</seg>
<seg id="36">Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.</seg>
<seg id="37">I didn't want that my last race was.</seg>
<seg id="38">That would have much pressure.</seg>
<seg id="39">In London it took about six months to realize that I am a Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="40">It was all so new for me and I was so stressed.</seg>

<seg id="2">The singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp already their whole life: as young girl she was in the choir, in the teaching position she took the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a seniors chorus.</seg>
<seg id="3">"I'm moving - emotional and physical," she describes.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a rehearsal she feels more balanced, cheerful and more lively, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">By the way, she does something good in their health and mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">For singing is a great hobby for seniors, says Erhard Hackles from the German veteran liga.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most seniors sing in the chorus and sharing with equines the joy of music, Hackler describes.</seg>
<seg id="8">The regular cohesion can establish and maintain seniors social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">For frequent, social and family structures in old age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "this experience also made the Ursel Kipp in her chorus:" "" "to speak and organize to meet the others and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of collective consciousness." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be stressful in the positive sense, writes hiccups.</seg>

<seg id="13">Whoever urges his lungs regularly, is not as fast as the purest in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even if it comes to get the sound of the voice in old age, singing is an optimal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">In addition to older people, singing often has a very special effect, Ursula Lenz says of the Federal Labour Community of Senior Citizens.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the previous generations, joint singing had a much higher job value, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and in leisure time, she explains.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz frequently observes that singing or listening of songs are aroused with older people, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.</seg>
<seg id="18">By lyrics and especially melodies, people are hurrying to oppose people in long past events.</seg>
<seg id="19">When singing, the head also requires a special power, Lenz explains.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time to concentrate on their own voice and to adapt to a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Just older people who live alone, practice not only to concentrate on yourself.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition that one drives through singing in the choir, Hackles means.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">The self-esteem is also growing by singing in a choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show yourself: if I am long for something, I will get better and watch over me - this experience strengthens.</seg>
<seg id="26">Good reasons to begin with singing, so there is enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">Who wants to try a new hobby, should not hesitate - even if he means to have little talent, Lenz reveals.</seg>
<seg id="28">You don't sing alone - with 50 singing people who are listening to it when a sound is next?</seg>
<seg id="29">Looking for a suitable offer, seniors have different ways, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">If someone is singing from a friend in a senior town, you can simply join.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer overviews over the choirs in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in a church choir can turn right to the church or the Church.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many veteran choirs will also be found via the internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">Anyone who has no access to the Internet can ask family, friends or neighbors for the help of Internet booking.</seg>

<seg id="2">One day after having shot three gates during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two gates of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3-0.</seg>
<seg id="3">Five gates in two games should actually represent a memorable achievement, but Bam (27) said she could not remember that ever done.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I have no idea." she said.</seg>
<seg id="5">I don't belong to people who keep their goals in memory.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, they know: the Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic Contests and are equalled to their group with the Briton in the first place that after their 2-0 victory against Japan remain unbeaten.</seg>
<seg id="7">Britain and the United States will be meeting on Saturday in the last round of the first round.</seg>
<seg id="8">Both teams have qualified for the quarter final, the game will decide which the two teams will gain from the first and second place within their group of six teams.</seg>
<seg id="9">The first placed is the strong Dutch little bit longer out of the way that the other group will lead.</seg>
<seg id="10">As always the game may go out on Saturday, the Americans have triggered a surprising vortex through their success story, four years after they landed with the last London games on the last of 12 seats.</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and was the first time with three years a hockey racket in hands (her two older sisters played at the sports at Drexel University), at 16 years she became a national player in the USA, the youngest in the history of the team.</seg>
<seg id="13">They missed the Olympics in 2008 as they could not qualify for the cadres.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then came the year 2012, where she and her team did everything wrong.</seg>

<seg id="1">Immersed in the Rage of the Olympic Games, Zen of the Trampolins</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, how late it is, it is the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro are constant and inevitable, a rapid Staffellan between competition and pursuit.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is, as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning staff, which is served as a swimmer to Turner for triathletes.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't listen to the TV, read a newspaper or listen when talking about your neighbors in the Coffeshop, without hearing Simone Bales, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who is for the first time with the Olympic Games and a woman's black with dimples, could have been sent by these well-known names using sponsors and well-being TV advertising, if he would be a swimmers, Turner or even fennel.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fighting in Olympic trampolines around gold.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate any event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the centre, partly in the shade are the sports that are not universally recognised: aerial shooting, archery, badminton, Taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always swim the breastplate, and may reign for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I should make some humble arguments for my particular favourite, then let me turn the attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although it has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had been an Olympic event since 2000, it was noticed that many people had questioned so many that, I was questioned, didn't know that there is an Olympic portart.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the USA has sent the competition for competition, it has never gained a medal on the trampoline and had a athlets until 2012, who made it to the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and Russians will tend to share prices for men and the Chinese and the Canadians for women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend her gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampoline jumping has a certain exterior charms, partly because it sounds for the unenlightened ear than that sounds for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I'm not an expert, but only a loving enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humorously potential - the cartoonous trembling of his never ending up - but also the Grazie of the gym and diving, the two sports which are essentially reunited.</seg>
<seg id="21">The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means as much as "springboard."</seg>
<seg id="22">Emerging victors jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 foot in the air and must land a number of falling movements (turning, hens and Saltos) before they land on the feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">They are judged by an official Olympic team after executing, difficulty level, and "flight time."</seg>
<seg id="24">Two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">"" "" "" "medallists must go on in their quest for gold, quicker, go up and go back, sometimes until the finish, sometimes and back, down and down on the playground." ""</seg>
<seg id="27">They do not only hunt the finish line or the power wall, but also in the television transmission a further polite goal: the world or the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="28">The targeted strokes is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it's enough to make even a viewer to tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I think even when watching this games as a somewhat tiring.</seg>
<seg id="30">This trampoline offers an attraction.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or her pallt, seemingly heaviest as an astronaut, goes up, then downwards, then back to the top.</seg>
<seg id="34">There is also a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during exercise there is no hectic attack on the destination, no vault into the distance, only the dreamy, elegant uplifting of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is so Zen like the competition for the Olympic Games can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">The Qualification and Endrons of Women will take place on Friday afternoon, at 13.00 Eastern Time in streaming; which the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will radiate the end customers as part of an afternoon block at 2 days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the midst of the Olympia-Mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that will probably survive in general tumult.</seg>
<seg id="39">When the increase of consciousness is achieved only by the attachments and objectification of male athletes - like the male US Turner, according to The Wall Street Journal recently suggested - then Mr Dooley expects its air rinses, new fanbase.</seg>

<seg id="1">"a generation protesting" in Ethiopia, Long is a member of the USA</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protest in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Protesters, the political changes in Ethiopia are calling for violent resistance to the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that many protesters were killed during clashes with the police in heaviness.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just to break with it?</seg>
<seg id="6">In the past ten years, it was one of the wealthier countries in Africa, a solid war with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in the last few months, protests against the government had shaken the country and expanded more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week, thousands of people stormed down streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to human rights organisations, the answer of the government was merciful.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses said that policemen were shot and killed in unarmed protesters.</seg>
<seg id="11">In circulation, videos about protests, probably from the last or early of this year, show how security guards beat young people with sticks, while they were forced to make a stand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN Security Council for Human Rights now requires an incoming examination.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it was always difficult to keep this country, and in future it becomes even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa from the International Crisis Group, a research group.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country of Africa and its stability is estimated from the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and secret services are working closely with the Ethiopians to fight terror across the region, in particular in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if at all, get so much Western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a remarkable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new campaign in Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">The roads are usually quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even though Ethiopia was anything but an example of democracy - human rights organisations have continued to lead the oppression by government - the opposition in the country has been restricted, with dissidents effective for silence.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile, or put into prison, or driven into the wilderness of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that might change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "if you suppress people and do not have any other options except protesting, it breaks out" "" "said Liyoum Teshome, a teacher in the Ethiopian Ethiopian." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protested.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from the land use to digging in relation to power the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">"" "" "" "after a widespread election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament." ""</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, tensions descend along the border to Eritrea; a struggle for these zjagged, controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts fear that separatists as the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, who were more or less forced in recent years, could be more beneficial to turmoil.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of interbiting after years of age has been explode under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years, very many Ethiopians were able to communicate with the social media, as cheap Smartphones was becoming more and more common and the internet services improved.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government blocked the access to Facebook and Twitter, especially at regular intervals, many people still do more about Internet-Proxies to hide, where they can stop.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians gave it to be the protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there are more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two biggest ethnicities in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amhara are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">Since Etrons, the Amhara prospered from branches, mainly Christian high countries, in politics and business, while they exploited the Oromos, many of which are many Muslims and live in lowland areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But this also changes.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are to coordinate under a umbrella," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests were held in areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have dominated the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, which accounts for around 6 percent of the population and most dominant in the military, in trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr Meles, a former rebel leader, was until his death in a non-public illness in 2012 17 years of Ethiopia's prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was regarded as a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that it was particularly veraging to perceive early signs of dissatisfaction and to use special officers to edit opponents and make them harmful.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the current regime is lacking in this fundamental skill," "" "said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopia's new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen from relatively opaque reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr Meles, who came from the Tiger region in Northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the South.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he enjoys the confidence of the safety services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time that Ethiopia had experienced such a riot in 2005, after thousands of elections were protesting against the government and stolen by the government.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the following Razants, many Protestants were killed, even though it was less than in the last months, and the rest of the unrest went relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new lease, and for their measurable progress in poverty.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this did not prevent the intensification of the internal abuse of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnic shape.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month, Protestants in Gondar, an amhara city, led by Tigray and the hatred towards the Tigray is becoming more common in social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests against the US and other Western allies put in a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as a basis for Dronenflights over the neighboring Somalia, even if they recently told they had closed this base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West clearly wants to support democracy, he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile area.</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," said Mr Abdi, "is a very thin tightrope."</seg>

<seg id="5">After he had made the statement on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump had taken back on Thursday's claim on Thursday and insisted on interviews that he really did not intend to seize ISIS and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning Tweet a Friday Mr. Trump said, he was just sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The tweet was contrary to the previous day where Mr. Trump said in a number of interviews, he said the accusation perfectly seriously.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative radio presenter Hugh Hewitt Mr. Trump wanted to reweaken the statement, that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS is willing to know nothing about the republican candidate.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of critique lies on Mr. Trump, while he tries to focus the focus of his campaign for falling demand on economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton talked to economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday Mr. Trump tried to return again to this subject.</seg>
<seg id="12">Via Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July he moved strong criticism, when he said the Russians should look at Mrs. Clinton's emails, but later he said "Of course," I said the sarcastic. "</seg>

<seg id="17">However, I think he is smart enough to keep his statements vague enough so they can be interpreted in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of defuse the sound for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has assumed an unknown tone, because its demand went further back.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey of NBC / Wall Street Journal / Maris, which was published on Friday, showed a guided tour with a big lead in the states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-in-head-race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump generally tries to apologize for his provocative remarks, he accused his critics to distort his testimony, or to understand his testimony.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while he stands in focus on the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps joke his loyalist Mitstreiter brought to him in an uncomfortable situation, regardless of how provocative also may be his testimony.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York, and one of Trumps most prominent advocates, there were great effort to defend the candidates today in a CNN interview of Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "I believe what he says is legitimate, political comments" "" "said Mr. Giuliani, so he was interrogated by Mr. Trumps that Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State." ""</seg>

<seg id="25">Most mainstream republicans try to argue that Mrs. Clinton served as an Foreign Minister, in which Mrs. Clinton served as an external minister having allowed ISIS to spread out the situation in the Middle East.</seg>

<seg id="4">The business of Soap Cherie that replaced Verb in the summer of 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland: the oldest cyclone is nearly 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland is usually only in winter to the surface.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the Sanna research ship.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and swims with a 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - to the present day.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland only became young with 150 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="7">Leisurely, the Greenland-shark swims along the ground of the North Atlantic, in an hour he has an average of 1.220 meters.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it comes to it, the five meters long animal accelerates on a full 2.6 km / h - and this top speed is half as fast as a seal.</seg>
<seg id="9">This long-term lifestyle seems to be a sponsor for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report the professional journal "Science" at any rate of a Greenland who could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "madness," "" "commented Alexander Shelter from the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock, this life span, which means a world record for vertebrates." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Indeed, the Evolutionary biologist suspected that Greenland will be petrified.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence failed.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland is difficult to observe, eventually they live primarily in the ice sea before the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because you prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear in the winter only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers have little knowledge about the lifestyle of Greenland.</seg>
<seg id="17">Her timpentpentagon wells them, when they spread six animals with a transmitter in front of the Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a Robbe, another one had swallowed the jaw bone of a young polar bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">Perhaps they hunt sleeping animals or patrousing at the bottom of the ice cream and are looking for Kadaver, which torches out of higher water layers.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues studied 28 Grönlandhaie, the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or Svalbard as a bycatch from the depth of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 centimetres long, while the biggest 502-centimetres measured.</seg>
<seg id="22">To determine the age of animals, they analyzed the line core of the sharks with the carbon-14 method.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye lens emerges already before the birth of the sharks, which are not renewed in the proteins later.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had a lot of carbon-14 in line-up.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their birth should therefore lie down after the early 1960s, as a nuclear test, larger quantities of this radioactive carbon in the atmosphere worse.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the length of 220 centimeters long, the line core contained a low surplus of carbon-14 from nuclear weapons, so it is likely to have celebrated his 50th birthday at his study in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">All bigger Grönlandsharks had normal carbon-14 quantities in its line-core, which occurs by cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14-clock for a 493 cm long Greenland-shark showed an age of 335 or even during the record shark with 502 centimeters even 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenland-shark females only get offspring when they are more than four meters, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers were able to assign an age to the length of the length.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimeters probably stood at the threshold of the sexually mature and his age was built with 156 years, Grönlandhaie with the multiplication is obviously at least one and a half centuries time.</seg>
<seg id="32">This should also be the world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusaleme are mainly living in icy waters, is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">Also the previous record holder, a 211 year old Grönlandwal, in his bacon on the neck a 120 year old Harpunenspitze, was caught before Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">The low temperatures often runs in the organism of living animals on a flaming torment.</seg>
<seg id="36">They intervene later - and slow down.</seg>
<seg id="37">To keep warm in cold water, the animals are often very large.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume is growing much faster than its surface, by which the beast gets heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much bigger than with an grams of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have less enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal lives so dangerous and should focus on it as early as possible as possible as possible, as if possible, as soon as possible as possible," explains the Evolutionist Schizophrenlein.</seg>
<seg id="42">A very big animal should always invest his resources in long life.</seg>

<seg id="6">16 Minis from Bittelbronn, Gruol, and Haigerloch and Heiligence went on the way.</seg>

<seg id="15">But even at the small chance, Mrs. Jenner is described - which is described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of their generation - under the previous category, it is in good company.</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities are not related to celebrities or reality stars or youths from today, who know how to turn a good Snapchat video (even if everything applies to Jenner).</seg>

<seg id="18">Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had the publication of Lemonade one of the most successful years of her career.</seg>
<seg id="19">Of course Jenners don't like success each.</seg>

<seg id="21">In June, the former Victoria's Secret Model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid and called it "the Mistails of the Moment."</seg>

<seg id="8">"we're watching a terrifying rapid evolution of the malware," explains Malwarebytes-boss Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "world."</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008 most Malwareprograms were still designed to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered blackmailing software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">Only then were private users the goal, but the change to company attacks was frightening over the past few months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works after an easy pattern: once on the computer of a victim, it searches for unlong changed files such as Word-, Excel- or database files, as well as archives images and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypts Ransomware and deletes the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">The software then presents the demands of the blackmailing.</seg>
<seg id="15">To get the final key code to the files, the victims need money - usually in the form of Crypad Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where private users find the personal photo database on the game, it's about sensitive customer data or project databases, without which the production is shut down.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly, the damage is damaged if a ransomware does not fall.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of the affected German companies reported sales losses due to Ransomware, 13 per cent even had to break down the business, in a case, people were in danger of life.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany, numerous hospitals were victims of attacks, whose patients could be threatened by the loss of nurse.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "we always say the sacrifices: pay not, you only promotes the problem," "" "explains Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But 80 to 90 percent of companies paying their data will get back.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers, it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know this and try to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, the safety researchers of F-Secure investigates the user interfaces and the contact with the expressions and come to the result: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">You agree to their sacrifices by chat as they can pay by Bitcoin, judge freely accessible support websites or decrypt free example files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And private people will redeem by only a few hundred Euro, companies need to negotiate hard and have five-digit sums to return to their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">In view of the potentially high and relatively risky winnings from Ransomware Erpresets, the hackers are always professional and share the work, explains security experts Chester Wisniewski of the anti-virus provider Sophos: "a single person can write a ransomware by a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">More likely, however, it is about three or four people.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their damage software then in the form of a software construction kit to the actual blackmailing.</seg>
<seg id="30">The previous malware kits were created by adding malware, advice and additional tools for a single, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"the scope of delivery includes a adaptable, so that smaller configurations, looks and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="32">The blacksmith then search for further hackers to spread the freshly bought software under the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service economy.</seg>
<seg id="34">So, one of the forums in the underground, buys the set of a criminal and asked another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is made by a certified computer.</seg>
<seg id="36">"usually, the criminals carry spammers with the spread," explains Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is now known for many companies that ensure their data better.</seg>
<seg id="38">Over 50 per cent of companies in the Malwarebytes-survey are confident that Ransomware is able to stand off using a file-back-ups and scannersoftware.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already following new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "if the encryption from data alone is no sufficient threat to successful savings, the perpetrators instead with the release of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing" "", "explains Malwarebytes-boss Marcin Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">For this, the potential for damages is still higher than before the type of data is much higher than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">The perpetrators could also be able to remove completely new goals on the Internet of things.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the Hackerconference Defcon demonstrate their safety researchers, as they were able to get connected to the Internet with the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of winter the activation of a derart blocked heating so many victims could be worth a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators then instead of heating in the future block an entire production line in a factory, Ransomware could also be a topic in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the evening, you walk forever at night, while at night it is awake for hours, in the morning you can no longer think of sleep anymore.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is all other than relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, one is with such problems in good company: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about one quarter of adult sleep problems and more than ten per cent empiously find their sleep often or permanent.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleeping problems or sleep problems?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep problems, and there are various causes underlying them, emphasizes Hans-Günter Weeß, member of the board of the German Society for Schlaffing and Sleep Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">Whatever you understands, but the insomnie, thus, is an insomatic and a sleep problem.</seg>
<seg id="8">Just the sleep empires many people find as unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the German House medical association with practice in the Lower Saxon Varel.</seg>
<seg id="9">What's behind sleep problems?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind this, organic, mental or behavioural factors can, but also have medicines.</seg>
<seg id="12">Not rarely is the insomatic expression of another disease.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "very early awakening is especially frequent with depression," "" "says Weeß." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors deserve each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">Those who have a herniated disc, can lie badly, wakes up every two to three hours and always catches to ponderous about everyday problems and care, gives Weeß an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should I sleep with sleep problems?</seg>
<seg id="18">If you do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week, should be affected by the doctor, Weeß says.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment can look quite different: it is abhorred, tired, unable to sleep, has difficulty with attention and concentration, has trouble-fluctuations or physical problems such as stomach or headaches.</seg>
<seg id="20">To prevent sleep disturbance, it is important to find out their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">As treatment options, behavioral changes, cognitive Behavioral therapy or medicines - classic sleeping pills just in case of emergency and maximum for two weeks - inquire.</seg>
<seg id="22">There are hardly any sleeping medicine in Germany, emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the Interdisciplinary Medical Center of Charité University Medicine Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">That is why one should contact with sleeping problems first to the housephysician, Weeß says.</seg>
<seg id="24">This can clarify with examinations, whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to sleep laboratory, and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">For example, in case of sleep laboratory medical, for example, snoring with respiratory reflexies, in case of disease injury or if one cannot find the cause of a crescence, Fietze explains.</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare for the test.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"please do not make a lunch sleep," Fietze says.</seg>
<seg id="30">After the wired one goes to bed at its normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">In addition to the electrodes in the body, one is wearing a nasal sunglasses, a chest strap and a antennler.</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition, a camera is drawing to the ceiling on the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can we get the problems in the handle?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite many positions, where you can set for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">Weeß counts on: regular sleeping and stopping times, not to sleep long in bed, do not sleep on the day, not watch TV for sleeping, alcohol avoid the day and not to watch at night - and that's all at all right.</seg>

<seg id="5">"" "article about this" "" "trendy neighborhood" "", "as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain, however, are preferred by burning cars in recent weeks." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Reason is the house with the number 94: once it was busy, the occupying contracts, on the ground floor, are still occupied spaces and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Especially the Berlin interior designer, in particular, since the beginning of the year, he pronounced repeatedly for a hard lead by the police against the project as "No-Go Zone" for policemen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">After 22 June the rooms were cleared out on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, with 300 police officers, had patroamed the police for three weeks with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site, spersed parts of the road and held visitors to enter the house with the number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the meantime, renovated building workers on behalf of the unknown homeowners.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin administrative district decided that the clearance had been illegally, and one day later the police and building workers moved under the youth of sympathizers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon the road seems peaceful: parents walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others are talking about Späti.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the hood projects there are an elementary school and nursery.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left violence is not the main orge of many local residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in Kiev since 1999, and Jana *, which are largely composed by three children, are mainly driven by the police presence.</seg>

<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working service, which also has a lower average of average and high risk of poverty in comparison to the rest of the city.</seg>
<seg id="18">Also houses and native projects have long been to Kiev: in 1990, numerous houses in the former GDR were occupied, including almost the entire Mainzer street in the vicinity of the Rigaer.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer has been evacuated under large police force in a real street battle, many of the projects were legalized in the Rigaer and are still inhabited by people who had occupied them 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the city's district has become increasingly difficult for tourists and consterners from all over the world, with them local residents from GDR times and former home-occupants are sharing their jaw.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is also noticeable for the rent, which has risen by almost 60 percent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the newbuilds in the Rigaer are attacked as symbols for this development: you recognize it on the raised slices or freshly painted Façades that were captured with paint bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other road was mentioned so often together with the words "left-autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "" "" "one reason that not all neighbors could be seen as a problem, that they are not strictly affected by crime: crimes such as bodily injury, according to statistics, almost exclusively against policemen." ""</seg>
<seg id="25">The largest part of the offences make objections, which tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives for 17 years in a rental house next to the controversial 94, there can be no talk of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">As far as they are concerned, they are important: the people in the 94 are their neighbours who were not meant to be.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars I don't give it directly in the Rigaer anymore.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the studied architecture in architecture, her road is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary: "here one helps each other, lives together on the road and gets more from each other than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer is deliberately drawn into the Rigaer Street - and stayed.</seg>
<seg id="31">This is why it was so important that local residents got their way back: from police, politics and media, which suddenly claimed the interpretation of the area in July.</seg>
<seg id="32">However, in the eyes of residents such as Neugebauer, the road continues to leave them: separated new buildings in former constructs that displace old residents.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "these are ultimately condominiums, which are not interesting for many people - here are people who are not so well cared for" "", "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "violence and destruction I can absolutely not guideate." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should one do if someone is never listening to anyone?</seg>
<seg id="36">There is frustration at all sides, even with the police and the residents.</seg>
<seg id="37">For dragging about colour bombs, Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding: the hood projects and the left scene belonged to the Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="38">Who moves, should be aware of it - just like someone who moves in a pub area to complain badly about noise.</seg>
<seg id="39">All persons displayed only with first names have to be asked to be called by their proper name</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuschle is new refugee budsman</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact partner in the integration and organizer.</seg>
<seg id="3">It is also a social worker locally.</seg>
<seg id="4">Annika Deuschle has been the refugee budsman for Urbach since July.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogy supports the team of administration around Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">She looks as a contact partner for all actors: refugees, working group refugee aid, administration, authorities and those else involved.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine client of working group indicates that the volunteers are more than thankful that Deuschle is now that the maturing Wollmilky, which primarily has a problem.</seg>
<seg id="8">So some - less sparking than rather than the multitude of desired tasks are purposely meant - meant as the management wanted to write the place.</seg>
<seg id="9">The management expert was chosen by a talent for languages and people, associated with a long-term experience in the field of social work, an eiving wool melchsau.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administrative work is not its central area, Annika Deuschle means.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it is about organization, working with people on site and also behind the scenes and network activity.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been working for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 percent point on three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "it was high time," "" "says Regine Customer that Annika Deuschle and main actors support." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">There are big and small problems, organisational, human and understanding problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">New containers are soon available in the waterway.</seg>
<seg id="17">A serious problem has been to be found for some time, apartments for connecting wings, which have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">The municipalities are responsible for connecting the connections.</seg>
<seg id="19">They need to place refugees in their own or hired living rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">The costs for the construction, rent or the renovation of these accommodations must bear the municipalities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">Responsibility is changing from the land-rats to Commune and Jobcenter.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto the administration is not found private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">So far, it does not work so far to rely on private apartments so Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, common homes must be erect as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers are installed in the waterway.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with homes it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Prospect is the keyword, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a firm lead, there are internship placements, training places, one-euro jobs and helpers for refugees and migrants who have to be tiled or set up.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," said Regine Customer.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help home master, attend charitable work - and that motivates and very tidy, as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes the work for the church leads to a positive impact.</seg>
<seg id="34">That is "no employment therapy."</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The tag need a fixed structure, say Deuschle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a feasibility experience.</seg>
<seg id="38">So there are offers like sport, contacts with locals, and especially in language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So here administrative and honorary citizens are jumping.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees are feeling that they are welcome and welcome them in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the process is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "" "" "they must explain the refugees that it takes just and they can bridge the time sense, for example with language courses." ""</seg>
<seg id="44">Who sometime feel the feeling that he can't help in Urbach nobody can work and be unnütz, who will never incorporate.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"" "but problem cases are also honest," "" "people who don't know anything about them." "" "the work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always willing to motivate others." ""</seg>
<seg id="47">All this is already a "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: have the two fear of radicalization, even in a small community like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," says Regine client quite clearly, "what some naive may call" "". "a remaining risk can and doesn't want to exclude them out." ""</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are sensitized.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have fear that the assassinations took them completely in call.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with that," says Regine Customer.</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So, main and volunteer work must take place in the region and in the region.</seg>
<seg id="56">They always have in the background that a new Stoß could come to refugees and migrants to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">To answer this question clearly, the politics.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually, it is unfair to place them helpers on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach, we are not there yet, where we want to go," says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would be able to relax.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer also clearly makes sure that the Urgbacher are aligned to embed the previous people reasonable.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently around 100 people, mostly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But when people are in need, they must help them both are women.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there is no simple answers.</seg>
