Obama conc@@ ei@@ ves Netanyahu
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not just friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and Te@@ hr@@ an &apos;s dest@@ ab@@ ili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
but the encounter with the Palest@@ inians should also discuss the conflict with the Palest@@ inians and the argu@@ ing two @-@ state solution .
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises the ongoing &quot; urban development of Israel and pron@@ ounce its def@@ ending will on the peace process .
the deal with Obama wor@@ ded around the Iranian nuclear programme has deteri@@ or@@ ated the relationship of both .
in March Netanyahu said on invitation of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans to the US Congress a controversial statement that was partly headed by the Parliament against Obama .
Obama was not talking with Obama , a meeting had refused to be im@@ min@@ ent to the election in Israel .
in a emergency call , professor , who shot his girlfriend .
in a not@@ ary , Professor Sh@@ annon Lamb told me with a sc@@ ary voice of the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officers had to come to his house .
Lamb was important to emphas@@ ize that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said that family contact could be found on the mobile phone .
inside the house officials bel@@ ied the bodies of Amy Pr@@ ent@@ iss and a hand written note that was on a white block , I loved Amy and she &apos;s the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was signed by the authorities in the letter , and he was signed from Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb that traveled in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland , Mississippi , settled already 300 miles to the subject area , where he was shot and killed by the police after details of the police , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University police chief Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that University staff members have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 .
he said that Lamb made the dis@@ astro@@ us emergency call .
until the end of the day , there was another death : he took life when police en@@ cir@@ cled it .
a day after shooting in the university , students and teachers for@@ cing to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb led .
the details of the con@@ ciliation at both ends of the state , such as what students and staff who knew him , helped him , helped to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teachers .
students said they were looking forward to teaching .
the police in G@@ auti@@ er , where Pr@@ un@@ iss died , he didn &apos;t have history of violence or a criminal history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt himself stated Lamb in one of his written book where he mentioned the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wonderful people &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both submitted in the Department of Social Sciences and History , comprising 17 members , and many students visited courses of both .
at the same time , there were some ex@@ propri@@ ation of proble@@ matic behavi@@ ors .
a student , Bran@@ don Be@@ aver@@ s , Lamb praised , said he also seemed a bit nervous and nervous , as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him about dealing with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
Lamb had asked the Delta State University for health reasons , and said that he had asked any health problem for health reasons .
this year he taught only two online courses .
the latest amend@@ ments to the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the Doc@@ torate , for which Lamb had worked so hard for the Lamb , would not guarantee the automatic way to an evaluation as Assistant Professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ ws said that he did not know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions that Lamb wouldn &apos;t answer .
after the escape from the campus , police later took Lam@@ bs Spur , as he once again entered the Mississippi from Arkan@@ s@@ as .
before he was arrested , Lamb shot himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ bre gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississippi , said Washington County Cor@@ onal meth@@ el Johnson .
his car was still in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not clear why lamb went to this house , but Johnson said she believes that he knew the people who lived there .
Lamb grew up in the region .
Lamb began work at the university in 2009 , whose number has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with around 12,000 inhabitants and taught geography and ped@@ agog@@ y .
he graduated in the spring of ped@@ agog@@ y .
one of the long @-@ standing friends Lam@@ bs called him intelligent , charis@@ matic and fun .
Carla Hair@@ ston said she was 15 years and he was 20 when they met together with friends .
they and their friends were at High School , and he was the cool old guy who tried to teach the guitar playing .
he was at the time of the Frauen@@ alp .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all girls are mol@@ ded there when he was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hair@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson subur@@ b of Bran@@ don . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb and Pr@@ un@@ ition were obviously up some time together .
in the emergency call , Lamb &apos; I killed my wife , &apos; but there was no certificate from a marriage .
they had a dog named Light@@ ning who lived with them in the brick house that joins a Ba@@ you in G@@ auti@@ er .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enz@@ iss , Shawn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said that they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and a daughter who now was 19 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was totally destroyed at the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en over his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said that he never met Lamb , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played the blues .
Lamb obtained Pr@@ un@@ iss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail arrived three years ago , both in a summer @-@ year @-@ up .
later they played together the one or another gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings their own music .
I was a nurse , who worked for several companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ keeper , and sometimes entertainment coordin@@ ator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak illuminated bar at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , said that he broke Lamb and Pr@@ ent@@ iss Night in the night 5 September last time , after Lamb had finished his guitar and harmon@@ ic game before a spar@@ se audience .
there were no signs that anything was not right .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were at the skirts and j@@ oked .
I mean , they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
Schmidt , the dead professor , directed the first semester program and specialised in American indigenous and colonial history , Fr . Allan Mitchell , a English @-@ professor at school .
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the University of Kansas State University in Kansas and was president of its Brotherhood and the Student Committee .
on Tuesday evening about 900 people , including lec@@ turers , employees , students and members of the municipality were participating in a candle @-@ commem@@ oration ceremony .
Sch@@ mid@@ &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt took part in the Memorial watch , during the University of the &quot; B@@ right Morning Star &quot; and &quot; Amazing Grace &quot; .
the lessons are resumed on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to return our students to return , &quot; La@@ For@@ ge said .
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
Amy and Rog@@ el@@ io Soli@@ s reported from Cleveland , Mississippi .
Associated Press Auth@@ ors Emily Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Mississippi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected to reflect that the police had said that Lamb had shot the emergency call after he shot Schmidt , and that he did not see him as his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever been married .

Michael J. Fox : about his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat at the Theatre in the Roy@@ als , and I perceive that the seat is empty alongside me , and it will gradually become clear that Princess Diana is sitting next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film begins and it comes to me in mind that I am a sim@@ ulated s@@ Ã¤h@@ le and a noise of it from it , to be with the princess of Wales on a Date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd , as well as director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and the producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; back for the Future &quot; was first introduced 30 years ago .
&quot; it really is for me , &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; the biggest time travel film ever shot . &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be shown on V@@ OD , DVD and selected movie the@@ aters in October .
UN CEO says , there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; &quot; &quot; Secretary General Ban Ki @-@ moon says his response to Russia &apos;s reinforced military support for Syria : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no military solution , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no military solution &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of almost five years of conflict and more weapons will intensi@@ fy violence and mis@@ ery for millions of people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the UN CEO again calls for all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and integr@@ ative negotiations on finding a political solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to discuss the foreign ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - U.S. , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the br@@ ink of the meeting of the General Assembly on this month in order to discuss the situation in Syria . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he regre@@ ts that the separation in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation un@@ sol@@ ub@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ban asked the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity when confir@@ ming the crisis in Syria , which they have proven in the filing of a nuclear deal with Iran .
8 Re@@ frac@@ tional values , showing that Donald Tr@@ ump is taking serious .
some have tried to brand it as flop .
others have taken him a joke .
and some wait for a collapse .
but no matter how some Rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump in the upper ranks of p@@ olls , it has not worked ( yet ) .
ten of the last eleven new p@@ olls show Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit area , and some begin to ask seriously , what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of the real estate site .
of course it is too early in the election period .
neither claims that tr@@ ump might win the rep@@ ubli@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts emphas@@ ise that during this time , in 2011 , Rick Per@@ r@@ ys took the lead to the Asc@@ ending Herman Cain , of whom there won only one state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he could fight in a general election .
but out@@ side@@ ways such as Je@@ b Bus@@ ys Super P@@ AC and the conservative Economic group Club for Growth now recognize tr@@ um@@ ps @-@ stamina and start to drain the dollar to overthrow him .
here are some current demand values , indic@@ ating that the real estate site Mog@@ ul is not just a temporary phase :
Tr@@ um@@ ps popularity values have turned 180 degrees .
before Donald Tr@@ ump asked his can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University showed that just two of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans saw the real estate site Mog@@ ul .
by mid @-@ July , it was 40 percent .
in early August it was 52 percent .
now , six of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are holding in early states .
in Iowa , a Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac @-@ Tuning in Iowa said that 60 percent of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two thirds of GO@@ P elec@@ tors GO@@ P would be happy with b@@ ump than candidates .
in a survey of CNN / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of rep@@ ublic@@ ans , they would be either &quot; excited &quot; or &quot; satisfied if Tr@@ ump would be nominated .
only two out of 10 say they would be &quot; upset &quot; if he would be the candidate .
only Ben Car@@ son makes about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent ) saying they would &quot; exc@@ essi@@ vely &quot; ( 40 per cent , which will tell the same about jun@@ k ) .
the next in terms of excitement ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of rep@@ ubli@@ can voters say that they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; upset &quot; if Je@@ b Bush , the favourite of the establishment , would say .
a majority of rep@@ ublic@@ ans does not see tr@@ um@@ ps temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ised for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive testim@@ onies , 52 per cent of the real temper@@ ament is believed to be the real temper@@ ament for a President , such as ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is in the first electoral state of the nation , the federal state of Iowa , where the same 52 percent of rep@@ ublic@@ ans think he has the personality for a commander , according to Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
however , 44 percent said that it was not the personality to execute his post effectively , and nearly six out of 10 independ@@ ents say that his tem@@ per is not in the White House , so ABC / Post .
rep@@ ubli@@ can voters get used to the idea .
if it impos@@ es its schol@@ ars , rep@@ ubli@@ can voters hold pot@@ tery for real .
if asked , who is winning the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , say after a pol@@ l of CNN / OR@@ C from last week four out of ten that tr@@ ump is the best bet .
this is a change since the end of July , when four of ten of July you put money on Je@@ b Bush .
full disclos@@ ure : GO@@ P voters do not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
at this time in the last cycle , four out of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans reported that Rick Perry win the nom@@ ination , just 28 % for the final candidates Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
yet , this shows that a variety of GO@@ P @-@ voters will be a plau@@ sible campaign for plau@@ sible .
even if the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump defe@@ ats almost everyone .
some experts point out that the sh@@ atter@@ ed field probably contributes to tr@@ um@@ ps , while the Anti @-@ Tr@@ ump support is distributed over a dozen other Can@@ didates .
but a pol@@ l of the Mon@@ mouth @-@ University early September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head @-@ race between Tr@@ ump and most other rep@@ ubli@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump sum up the majority support .
he has 13 points ahead of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points ahead , before Walker 15 points ahead of Walker 15 points , before each b Bush 19 points and finally before edge Paul , John Kas@@ ich and Chris Christie 33 points .
it &apos;s a head @-@ on @-@ head @-@ race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head @-@ race .
a large majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans says that they have formed their mind .
a new pol@@ l of C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters that support Tr@@ ump , say that they have set up their votes .
of course , much has happened to change that , and no one can really say , never change the mind .
46 % said they leave the door open to switch to other candidates .
however , Tr@@ um@@ ps is the most powerful competition in the moment of the other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters think they have formed their mind twice as often for p@@ umping .
six out of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans say they co@@ inci@@ de with b@@ ump on the subject of immigration .
ever since Donald Tr@@ ump , in his election campaign , two months ago immigrants from Mexico &quot; has called &quot; rape &quot; - the immigration to the public dis@@ course was in the public dis@@ course .
some are worried that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression by Tr@@ ump is deci@@ ding deci@@ du@@ ous H@@ isp@@ ano @-@ Americans from the Republi@@ can Party and will damage the re@@ orientation efforts .
but according to the new ABC / Post @-@ survey Monday , six out of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say they would match with b@@ ump on issues of immigration .
so long as the Immig@@ ration remains in the li@@ mel@@ ight , it is likely to do Donald Tr@@ ump .
fru@@ stration over the government climb@@ s to new high@@ s .
with Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son , there is now about half of the support of rep@@ ubli@@ can voters , especially through their out@@ side@@ ways status .
six of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans say in the new album @-@ survey of ABC / Post they prefer a political under@@ dog than someone with government experience .
and they are also angry at Washington .
a survey conducted by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Bloom@@ berg in Iowa earlier two weeks ago shows that three of four Iowa rep@@ ublic@@ ans in the Congress is fru@@ str@@ ated with 54 per cent , &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential districts Germany
here in the Hob@@ oo@@ ken@@ weg is the most expensive residence with views over the North Sea .
a square meter of a cage in the street is average of 7@@ 3,@@ 300 Euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt the offer of objects is limited , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is in the study - so the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows , in which special layers costs one square meter the most .
of course , 18,@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little .
unlike Germany &apos;s top resorts , one of the price shows just like Pe@@ an@@ uts .
real estate service Angel &amp; VÃ¶lk@@ ers published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential sites - with square met@@ abolic prices in di@@ zz@@ ling high@@ s .
there are several ten thousand Euros , not per square meter , thou@@ ght@@ ful .
but good , who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is not really at the point here .
Champions League : Bavaria @-@ Dream start thanks to MÃ¼ller and GÃ¶@@ tze
double sc@@ orer in Piraeus : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas MÃ¼ller has just a run .
a happy match from Thomas MÃ¼ller on FC Bayern paved the way for a well @-@ earned 3 : 0 at the Olympi@@ ac@@ os Piraeus . then ran &apos;s .
a so@@ vereign pre@@ lu@@ de to the Champions League @-@ season .
the World Champion Thomas MÃ¼ller and Mario GÃ¶@@ tze got a dream start to FC Bayern in the Wit@@ ch@@ es@@ sel of Piraeus .
the team of coach P@@ ascha Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won their champion in the Champions League at the Greek record champion in hot atmosphere thanks to MÃ¼l@@ lers &apos;s twin pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and GÃ¶@@ tz@@ es hits ( 8@@ 9. ) deserves 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ f@@ th Star@@ ter@@ fol@@ g in series should be the first step towards final on May 28th 2016 in Italy where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola wants to finally catch the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third attempt .
MÃ¼ller received his 28th match in the Champions League of the Bayern @-@ Gui@@ ded Mi@@ th@@ ilfe chairman of the Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ go@@ alie Roberto , who made a f@@ lange back shot of the World Champion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we won &apos;t under@@ estimate this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bayern @-@ Captain Philipp L@@ ah@@ m before the game in the Kara@@ jan Car@@ ak@@ is Stadium before 31.@@ 6@@ 88 of hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich held his word . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated performance , without spar@@ ing .
Pi@@ re@@ e had won his youngest six hom@@ eg@@ ames in the royal class , among them for prestigious clubs like Manchester United , At@@ lÃ©@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 he stum@@ bled upon Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) .
but Bayern , in seven Europ@@ ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , didn &apos;t want to be the next victim .
they went cour@@ age@@ ously , with their offensive efforts , but often of imagin@@ ative works .
the attacks were often managed by a shift of turn left on the left side Douglas Costa , which reached the former Braunschwei@@ ger Omar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
MÃ¼ller was more fortunate than he made his f@@ lange from the right half @-@ field on the left side of To@@ re@@ ck .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the world champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
Robert Le@@ wand@@ owski was one of the best occasions in half .
first , as the Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ storms ide@@ ye Brown presented the head ball of Poland on the line ( 26th ) .
then by direct withdrawal , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto with the knee par@@ ked ( 3@@ 5. ) .
while the Bayern dominated her familiar game , Pi@@ re@@ aus was able to place needle @-@ down .
his keeper Manuel Neuer has been decre@@ ed .
thus , when he shot a shot of ide@@ ye about the lat@@ ted line ( 5@@ 6th ) .
prior to New Guinea , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola had a qu@@ anti@@ qu@@ ette with David Al@@ aba in the center next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng who made it well .
Mario GÃ¶@@ tze , after muscular problems back in the Ka@@ der , sat at the outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ WC @-@ Hero showed the green light after finishing the final training , said S &amp; D MEP Matthias Sam@@ pler , saying : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whoever wants anything else to do this is already mal@@ ign@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the first change , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided to fight against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an for the suggest@@ ing Le@@ wand@@ owski ( 5@@ 9. ) .
GÃ¶@@ tze arrived late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( 7@@ 6. ) and 13 minutes later everything was clear , by El@@ f@@ meter MÃ¼ller made a better one .
before the game it was in the stadium to Kra@@ w@@ alle .
after a smaller group of easily avoided Bayern fans in their audience @-@ blo@@ c the fans of hosts Pir@@ ae@@ us with words and gest@@ ures prov@@ oked the security forces and went with impact on the Munich followers .
at least a Bavaria fan was injured from the stadium .
those who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk to lose teeth
who smo@@ kes , harm can not only the lungs , but also the teeth - a Potsdam &apos;s long @-@ term study .
the good news : when ren@@ unci@@ ation , the risk is slow@@ ed down quickly .
smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
this comes from the long term study of an international research team , including several members of the German Institute for Food Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to smoking it is risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely but about 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3,6 times higher .
the scientists have observed more than 2@@ 3,@@ 300 participants .
main causes of fail@@ ures are c@@ aries and inflammation of the gum disease , emphas@@ izes DI@@ f@@ E .
smoking is a risk factor for this perio@@ don@@ tit@@ is , emphas@@ ise the authors .
the connection between smoking and dental loss means with@@ ers in frequent tooth infections with smokers back .
it has not been clari@@ fied , however , smoking is also increased risk of dental c@@ aries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people who stopped talking with smoking , however , could reduce their risk within a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could take more than ten years , until the endanger@@ ing appeared again to the level of non @-@ smokers , Initi@@ aut@@ or Thomas Dietrich showing from the English University of Birmingham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; men should persu@@ ade people to persu@@ ade people to smoke , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Te@@ aching course spokes@@ man for the DI@@ f@@ E said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking short@@ ens the lifetime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
smoking is good for lung and blood vessels and leads to our knowledge as well as good health initiatives up to high age .
over 20 percent of the population in Germany aged 65 to 74 years are affected by dental less@@ ness , the DI@@ f@@ E shared .
previous studies have already pointed out that smoking would increase the risk of early decision @-@ failure .
the new long @-@ term study regul@@ ates the findings .
archae@@ ologists re@@ tire from the Rhein@@ u@@ fer on remains of late anti@@ quity
as the repeated time , the right Rhein@@ u@@ fer in Cologne has been excav@@ ated archaeological findings .
in the vicinity of the site for the new Rhine bou@@ lev@@ ard , ar@@ che@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic Museum have excav@@ ated skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings , has said Museum Director Marcus Trier on Tuesday .
since the beginning of construction on the Rhine , hist@@ ori@@ ans are searching for so @-@ called ground monuments .
at all building areas in the urban district of Cologne , the museum will always be held as a specialist department for archaeological ground colour@@ ing .
in the third phase of the Rhine bou@@ lev@@ ard , the archae@@ ologist now became five .
it has already been known that text documents had already been known , that in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century stood a church , explained in Trier .
in addition to resi@@ ding the fortress and church tower , a cemetery with around 350 graves were discovered , which probably belonged to the church .

EU Commission proposes a new court in dispute over TTIP
the EU Commission proposed an extensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system to facilitate the pursu@@ its of its planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the controversial private security institutions between companies and countries should therefore be replaced by a transparent system , which is clearly more traditional to understand more traditional courts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system to trust citizens , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the competent European Commissioner Cecilia Malm@@ strÃ¶m today . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Swe@@ de tried to introduce the European negoti@@ ating position into free trade calls to the USA .
the German government announced support .
TTIP shall be the largest free trade zone in the world with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans to reform the current arbit@@ ration is con@@ cre@@ t@@ ingly that the EU states and the US are jointly elected independent judges for a new Investment Court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to equal parts from the EU , the US and third countries .
the first instance is provided for the first time .
it would allow it to rise against jud@@ gements .
according to date , the proce@@ eding involved each other on the arbit@@ rator , a formal objec@@ tion@@ ing against their judgments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent months it has become clear that citizens do not trust the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and justice , commenting on Malm@@ strÃ¶m . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , she wants to work towards a International Investment Court .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Investor @-@ State Ar@@ bit@@ ration Proce@@ dures will be called on TTIP ( IS@@ DS ) above all , as one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the traditional arbit@@ rators are critic@@ ised by opponents as a kind of parall@@ el@@ bow@@ iz , who can ride claims for tax@@ pay@@ ers , national laws , or reduction of consumer and environmental standards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the former statements of anti @-@ TTIP organizations such as camp@@ act , European Commission &apos;s proposals are in@@ adequate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was most critic@@ ized that they are not supposed to apply for the already negoti@@ ated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
the German economic state Secretary Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) marked the plans as a major step forward .
the Commission take into account the key points concerning the reform of Sig@@ mar Gabriel &apos;s Federal Minister of Economy in spring with other EU trade ministers .
the old system of private ump@@ tions is from the table .
the French government welcomed the plans of Malm@@ strÃ¶m .
the European Business Association Busin@@ ess@@ Europe warned that the demands on the economy can re@@ strict because of too many new rules .
this way , particularly small and medium businesses could be dis@@ advant@@ aged as it commanded .
when the talks on the TTIP free trade agreement ( Tran@@ sat@@ lan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be concluded , wed@@ n@@ esday continue to be un@@ clear .
negotiations have been underway since mid @-@ 2013 .
however , the subject of investment protection has not yet been discussed with the United States .
at the end of this year , a framework for the agreement should already come to the end of this year .
this date is considered no longer acceptable .
del@@ ik@@ ater Folk of Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens is sitting on the stage in the Cologne Prime club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
in addition to him , a flip chart , on which the shy folk singer has recorded the picturesque U.S. state Michigan with felt pen .
the entire audience , about 40 persons , is almost moved from Stev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he rel@@ ates from different places he always records on the map , which indicates its minim@@ alist and delicate songs .
where it originated , and how it looks like in his homeland .
since then Stev@@ ens has proven to be wonderful and creative .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the 2003 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gre@@ etings from Michigan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; album &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gre@@ etings from Michigan : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Great Lake State &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appear very well @-@ composed songs which can lubric@@ ate beautifully on American folk of the late six@@ ties , but dri@@ fting at any time in the great op@@ ul@@ ente . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rum@@ our , &quot; Michigan , &quot; is the first part of a retired series : each of the 50 US states should be represented in a row .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but already in 2004 and in Rhein@@ proximity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven sw@@ ans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been released and positive expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stev@@ ens reduces to Stev@@ ens here .
live is sufficient for him guitar and ban@@ jo .
a year later the musicians live back to the series in New @-@ York .
in 2005 , &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; ) was published in 2005 a nationwide celebrated master@@ piece .
translated into ideas and sty@@ list@@ ic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the US b@@ ill@@ board charts and is not missing in any annual list of the influential music media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Stev@@ ens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2010 ) serves very extensive electronic contracts for productive experiments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sixth annual studio album is still rich@@ ly orchest@@ rated , but carried by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all the effect and hall .
long ago the smaller club board shows , the stage shows here to look for the colourful spectac@@ le of Neon @-@ head@@ bands and a large fluores@@ cent stage .
currently Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens tou@@ red Germany as part of a five member band .
in the dark @-@ held ham@@ burger more !
he mainly presents theatre , &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell , &quot; available since March .
though nearly 2000 guests are ex@@ iled in their chairs , the clearly att@@ ack@@ ened Stev@@ ens returns to in@@ tim@@ acy and folk .
without a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians play through the wide @-@ enriched album .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the audience we hear : the lecture is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; op@@ ul@@ ent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you can throw the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plate essentially &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only to an en@@ core , Stev@@ ens would need to mo@@ dest@@ ly , acou@@ stically playing old songs and makes herself complete with thunder@@ ous applause .
Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ ns debut at Prime Minister &apos;s monetary policy .
for his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ n made an excitement at the Prime Minister &apos;s Quest@@ ionnaire .
the new leader Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n is said to have made his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s mission and start with David Cameron for the first time .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n is going to lift up the first of his six @-@ given questions shortly after noon , with his performance from the media is likely to be checked by the Labour delegation from the nearby media .
he called &quot; fewer theat@@ res and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could skip a few sessions to leave their colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary exam for Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns , since it comes after his appointment as a member of the Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ ab@@ in@@ let and following his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday .
meanwhile , in the meantime adopted by the Labour leader , Tuesday during the course of singing the national an@@ them in silence to the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , cr@@ iti@@ que of a number of T@@ ory @-@ M@@ PS prov@@ okes and is at the heart of several title pages in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns decision not to sing the national an@@ them , has drawn attention to itself
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stood in a respec@@ tful silence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he recognized the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ ab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , stated in the BBC Two News@@ night program , he advised the Labour leader , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; independent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that the monarchy should be abolished . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nearly a dozen of the shadows have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s top team , and they are called on dis@@ agreements with the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a hex@@ ag@@ el of the parliamentary party was originally supported as a leader .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the BBC correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stap@@ le &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns pron@@ oun@@ cements on the position of the European Union and the limit in winn@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C @-@ Conference to introduce real Labour to remove the whole idea of a limitation .
hours later , Mr Smith , the shadow of labour and pen@@ sions , said the &quot; very clear &quot; party , is that they only against the government plans to reduce the limitation of 26@@ ,000 Â£ to 23@@ ,000 pounds .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n is the fifth Labour leader David Cameron , ever since he is T@@ ory Group , over the last decade across the disp@@ atch box in the parliament .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Labour leader , who has promised another policies , says that he &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ideas for questions of Mr. Cameron has given him more than 30,000 ideas . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Is@@ lington North MP has said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Prime Minister of the Prime Minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that he is subjected to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; impact w@@ it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that he has done instead , focusing on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and challenges for young people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the shadow of business , is represented when he is not participating - for example when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
he also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues sometimes met the word in occasionally , and that he was talking to John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the house , to discuss the problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he became leaders in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he wants to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cas@@ le theater &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; but he often led to the prime minister of the Prime Minister . however , a few years later he acknowledged that he failed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when she was sent to TV in 1990 , the prime minister was considered the most important bar@@ ometer of the decision of a leader and his position , while critic is argu@@ ed under his parliamentary elections , although critics have argu@@ ed , they had become a caric@@ ature and need more extensive reforms .

pounds is raised by accelerated increase in wages in the UK
the pound was pr@@ un@@ tly after data , which showed an increase in the wage growth of the United Kingdom . in parallel , the FT@@ SE 100 was intensi@@ fied by the Geb@@ ot@@ sz@@ iel SA@@ BM@@ iller .
between May and July earnings without bonuses in the UK rose by 2.9 % compared to the same period of the same period .
this percentage had been the quick@@ est and under@@ estimated analysis of interest rates during 2009 .
the Po@@ und increased by more than 1 % compared to the dollar to $ 1,@@ 550@@ 5 and was climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % from the euro to â¬ 1.@@ 37@@ 30 .
the FT@@ SE 100 index closed with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6.@@ 2@@ 29,@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share in the market and made a 20 % jump , after the acquisition of the R@@ ival AB In@@ Be@@ v was received .
the transaction is to combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies of the world and brands like Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
Blue@@ berry shares were respon@@ ding to encour@@ aging messages from the competition for luxurious things - Rich@@ em@@ ont 0.@@ 9 % higher .
Richter &apos;s latest sales figures suggest all expectations and showed that the sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - to growth further growth .
shares of G@@ LEN@@ COR@@ E increased 5 % after the mining giant said that he took $ 2.5 billion through a block sale as part of its debt reduction strategy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the shares in the packaging and paper company MON@@ DI were the largest los@@ ers on the index , with a decline of 4.3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had its assessment for the rating of rating &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ D Sports increased by 3.1 % , after the sport packaging company reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.6 million .
head of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages thre@@ aten the expansion .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers can mean more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
but it is unlikely that such buying power will compens@@ ate for the higher labor costs in his company , he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the costs could expand expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean less additional jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot;

P@@ EG@@ IDA poster brings Lebanese and potato @-@ twe@@ ets
potatoes or twe@@ eter ?
both - and the potato @-@ driver in the potato @-@ driver of Han@@ i Al@@ h@@ ay has developed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; inspired by the saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; potato &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on a poster of the Peg@@ ida motion , Al@@ h@@ ay potato and meat put together on a ske@@ wer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea took him a poster with a Peg@@ ida demonstration with the inscription &quot; potatoes &quot; mid@@ range , &quot; which he had not seen on television .
since then the grill sp@@ ends a grill ske@@ wer , which is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; it is mul@@ ticul@@ tur@@ alism for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ h@@ ay .
the idea has meanwhile been able to register Lebanese law at the Patent Office in Munich .
according to the authority , it has been protected as a utility patent since recently .
so much meat and how much potatoes contain the ske@@ wer , Al@@ h@@ ay doesn &apos;t want to give away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only so much : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it tastes much better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he finds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even at its customers the culinary international understanding come well .
Met@@ cash k@@ icks off @-@ stand campaign for the fight against Al@@ di@@ - Sei@@ z@@ ure
Met@@ cash is trying to protect IG@@ A stores in front of Al@@ di &apos;s advance in South Australia and Western Australia .
food @-@ whol@@ es@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a high @-@ rise campaign in order to defend the market share of IG@@ A retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million US invasion .
while Al@@ di has prepared two sales centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia start next year , strengthen Met@@ cash and IG@@ A supermarkets their relationships with local food suppliers and build the IG@@ A brand via Main@@ stream Marketing and marketing over the social media , as well as events such as Adelaide @-@ Show .
IG@@ A dealers and suppliers are jumping on board , with brands such as iron manufacturer Simm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ borough , who sell tast@@ ed tickets for the South Australian soccer league to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ cash will publish further details of its Defence strategy on 29 September when the whol@@ es@@ aler for food , alcohol and devices will go through its annual investors strategy .
it is much on the game since South Australia and Western Australia , almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A are making up and higher profit mar@@ gins than the Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A network in the Eastern states generate .
proc@@ urement in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ally province provincial and IG@@ A retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to about 14 percent in eastern Australia .
however , analysts as Morgan Stanley is that Al@@ di twelve months after opening his first markets , accounts for about five percent of the market market in these two states and exp@@ elled all existing actors , but mainly independent individuals who get sales .
according to a report published in this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath from Morgan Stanley showed that IG@@ A retailers can lose 360 $ million revenue per year and cash cash $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this progn@@ osis is based on the assum@@ ption that Al@@ di has opened 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA and achieve a turnover of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in every market .
the loss in food and gro@@ c@@ eries and at large amounts on Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixation cost might cost around $ 13 million in earnings before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ cash market shares in eastern countries , mainly in Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey carried out by Roy Morgan that IG@@ A @-@ purchases are the most loyal .
Morgan Stanley is taking stock that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s is increasing by 3.8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and the market share of 14 percent in 2015 will reduce to 10.1 percent by 2020 .
last week , leading fon@@ d@@ manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , was the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , with a business lunch in Melbourne , that Met@@ cash is likely to disappear within a decade .
Met@@ ker@@ b refused to respond publicly to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a member of the board of Met@@ cash with Mr Dou@@ glass added a last week .
IG@@ As market share has been reduced by 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and income from met@@ c@@ ash@@ s , food and food retail , which has been reported by 43 percent since 2012 , reflec@@ ting debt reduction in revenues and mar@@ gins .
however , wholesale dealers caught up and inv@@ ests more than 150 million dollars in order to increase sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths in hundreds of products every week by improving fresh foods and provide a better choice of food @-@ label foods .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s &apos;s main managing director Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and shop rehabilitation programmes are hoping to grow and hopes that the whol@@ es@@ aler will return to profit for the first time in four years in 2017 .
Than@@ zi Kok@@ o@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian tennis ban@@ ands Steve He@@ aly
Than@@ zi Kok@@ o@@ ak@@ is deserves praise as a cr@@ iti@@ que for his behavior .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Than@@ ha@@ zi Kok@@ o@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the shorter storm around his friend Nick Mau@@ gios and deserves praise to view the President of the Australian tennis alliance Steve He@@ aly rather praise as a cr@@ iti@@ que for his own behaviour . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , which is constantly referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Special KS &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; by the not@@ orious analysis of Cy@@ gios with Stan WA@@ W@@ R@@ IN@@ KA in the Montreal Masters at the spotlight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a fier@@ y qualification game of Cincinnati soon , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated by the refer@@ ee , where Harrison had called : &quot; WA@@ W@@ R@@ IN@@ KA would have killed Kyr@@ gy@@ z , and I should sm@@ ite the child . &quot;
while he was recently sigh@@ ted , like a tennis ra@@ cket , after a cr@@ amp fell a potential US Open victory of Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ o@@ ak@@ is was with@@ drawn by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , in the competition with Sam Gr@@ oth on the second place in the single Davis Cup semi @-@ final against Great Britain .
&quot; one thing I vali@@ date myself , is the fact that after my view of Than@@ asi was a little happened in the argument , &quot; He@@ aly said .
he has broken a bat , when he lost due to a fighting in the US Open , but he is not the first player to break a bat of fru@@ stration and I know Than@@ asi was good enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even under the pretty pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Harrison and so forth , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think that he was a bit too strict .
he is a very mature 19 year old , he works very hard and he fits in the team and so on , he &apos;s still pract@@ ised with the other players , he is very hard , he &apos;s a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged on his own mer@@ its .
He@@ aly did not support the decision to take note that Cy@@ gios is taking into account the important decision to take on Friday and he describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right one for all , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long term being part into the team . &quot;
&quot; first we wish that the team is completely focused on the competition and not to all the contro@@ vers@@ y around . &quot; C@@ yr@@ gios ) , &quot; He@@ aly said .
and I believe that Nick made his asc@@ ension out very quickly , what people like Feder@@ er and Murray . he asc@@ ends in the eyes of the public , and he has earned some of the criticism that he can think about it , I think that he can only think about it , and it &apos;s best for the team , and it &apos;s best for the team and it &apos;s best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declared not@@ with@@ standing , closes the border and keeps refugees back
Hungary declared the state @-@ state and locked the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all firmly who tried to come into the land illeg@@ ally . everything with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed on the border when hundreds of migrants settled in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and Serbian officials with indig@@ nation .
people who fled before violence have settled for an unknown period in a landing on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there .
but Fru@@ str@@ ations climbed up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a police helicopter above them woven , the migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open the border ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and cried al@@ oud against the Hungarian polic@@ eman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some are back from protest foods and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s foreign minister declared it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unacceptable that migrants from Hungary would be returned , while more and more come from Macedonia and Greece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wishes to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ater@@ pillar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there must be talks with Brussels and other countries during the coming days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Iv@@ ica Dac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tur@@ mo@@ il at the Hungarian @-@ Serb border ended a day following the 28 @-@ nations block at a stum@@ bling meeting in Brussels to agree to a common immigration policy .
however , the minister agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who in the corrupt Italy and Greece would have taken refuge . they expressed its hope that finally - next month or until the end of the year - an agreement would have reached another 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria requested a special summit on the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hungary however did not put his hopes on an inter@@ rupt action of Brussels or his neighbors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the emergency in two southern regions announced on Tuesday gave more powers to combat the crisis so they could trigger roads and spe@@ eded asylum procedures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also had the construction of a bar@@ bed wire right alongside the border to Romania , in order to stop the immigration of migrants by the country , after leaving a fence at the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News Cor@@ respon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that there were even Pen@@ ins@@ ets on the race to create the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent months Hungary has become a significant bott@@ len@@ eck for many military refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East to the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban has failed , however , that most attacks , in search of a better life , are not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that strongly stands in opposition to other EU countries , including Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new laws , which came into force at midnight , went through the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 ft ) high Za@@ uns , which had built up the government along the southern border with Serbia , to a crime . these laws also place higher prison sentences for convicted traff@@ ickers .
&quot; due to the situation that originated by the mass migration , the Hungarian government explains the emergency state , &quot; said government spokes@@ man Z@@ olt@@ an Kov@@ acs rep@@ orters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Parliament must still agree to the operation of the military yet , which is expected next week , but rep@@ orter of the Associated Press has seen on the border badly armed soldiers with cars and dogs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security consultant for Or@@ ban , said that authorities will cross 45 people while attemp@@ ting to cross the border , 15 others were already invaded the country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they come over by taking the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of comm@@ itting criminal off@@ ences after the new laws .
authorities are able to fix the fence quickly .
Hungarian officials included two of the seven bor@@ der@@ ings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after a train car with bar@@ bed wire to close the fron@@ ti@@ ers .
chaos rel@@ ays the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to handle the data of people and pressed a crowd to get there .
about 20 succeeded in to come into , but thousands remained outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; another group of migrants blocked the main highway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to travel to Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
election 2016 : Hillary Clinton &apos;s lead ahead of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in National Bank
former US foreign minister Hillary Clinton still maintains a double @-@ digit margin in the democratic race , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins ground against its ground .
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of the voters of the elections ( 58 percent earlier ) , while S@@ anders is second in second place , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
vice president Joe Bi@@ den , who still did not tell whether he is dedicated to the presidential candidate , receives support from 15 percent of the democratic voters of the elections .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than five months prior to pres@@ election , most democratic voters say it too early in order to say that their opinions will determine which candidates will support them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Clin@@ tons supporters are more consistent than those of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS news survey Clinton has lost some of demo@@ graphic groups in a number of demo@@ graphic groups while others scored a few profits .
Clinton holds a great advantage in women and vegetables , but these jumps have decreased .
their support for the men is significantly dropped , and S@@ anders is just below 5 points .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clin@@ tons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; share with democratic voters under the age of 50 has ev@@ apor@@ ated , and they and S@@ anders are now on the same height . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Clinton has a great advantage in the older voters .
in the past month , Clinton had a double @-@ digit margin in the liber@@ als last month , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point lead in this group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about half of the voters of the pres@@ elections pre@@ dict that they were supported with enthusiasm when they were nominated by the party . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a quarter would support it with some pre@@ judi@@ ces and another 15 percent would only support them because they are the can@@ di@@ dat@@ in .
six percent would not support them .
maybe not surprising that Clin@@ tons &apos;s current supporters are especially enthusiastic about it .
the views are stronger in those who don &apos;t support Clinton - just about a quarter it would support it enthusi@@ ast@@ ically .
while 48 per cent of the voters of the elections are saying that they will support Clinton with enthusiasm , say less rep@@ ubli@@ can voters over her top candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
if Clin@@ tons supporters are asked in an open question , the most common answer is that she has the right experience ( 16 per cent ) , followed by the view that it is time that a woman is president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for a job ( 10 per cent ) .
it &apos;s even mentioned by Clin@@ tons Clinton &apos;s support with Bill Clinton ( 9 per cent ) .
consent to the problems and the voters will also be cited .
since the vice @-@ president has an potential for the presidential office in the scales , 57 percent of the pres@@ elections don &apos;t want to see him in the race - although a third believes that he should not do it .
if democratic voters are asked to decide who would choose their second vote , Bi@@ den is at the top .
by Clin@@ tons &apos;s followers more than half that Bi@@ den would have their second choice different from S@@ anders .
if Bi@@ den , not to nom@@ inate the demo@@ cra@@ t of demo@@ cr@@ ats , Hillary Clinton &apos;s lead increases in front of S@@ anders , with a lot of points in the race to 30 points without him in the race .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fifty @-@ five percent of the voters see Clinton in favour of winning the best chances of winning the election ; however , this number has dropped by 78 per cent in last month . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bi@@ den is by far a second with this measurement , but the percentage that looks at him than the &quot; sel@@ f@@ est &quot; has risen .
however , in the question of what is more important for a Can@@ didate , Democratic voters call questions about the voting .
similarly as last month , no single demo@@ cr@@ ati@@ ent candidate or potential candidate for the elec@@ torate considers itself unacceptable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Democratic candidate and potential candidates bring good results with some important features when voters want to select their party . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den consider totally tru@@ st@@ worthy and tru@@ st@@ worthy and with strong leadership qualities .
with the three candidates , Bi@@ den cuts the lead on hon@@ esty , while Clin@@ tons &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty per cent of the voters do not believe that Clinton is genu@@ in@@ ely and trusted , twice as many say about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) but 27 percent do not have an opinion about him .
Democratic voters of pres@@ elections see Clinton , S@@ anders , and Bi@@ den ide@@ ological in accordance with their views .
with all these measurements , about one quarter of the democratic voters no longer have the opinion of S@@ anders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are questions to Hillary Clinton &apos;s using a personal e @-@ mail address and a server during the term as an Foreign Minister , most of the elections are pleased with their explanation of the matter and say that their opinions did not affect their opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is a different story in the American public .
half of the Americans are un@@ happy with their explanation , while only about a third is satisfied .
public opinion was in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the e @-@ mail contro@@ vers@@ y had no impact on her general views of Clinton , while 36 percent said that her opinion about her was even wor@@ sen@@ ed .
they are mainly rep@@ ubli@@ can , more than six out of 10 who said their views of Clinton become worse .
although Clinton is considered true and trusted by the voters of their party , this is still a problem for them among registered voters : only 32 percent sees them as tru@@ thful and trusted , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of voting rights do not hold them for an honest and trusted person .
at the same time , 55 per cent of poll@@ ing views are far too tru@@ thful and non @-@ tru@@ st@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tr@@ ump , however , got good notes on the lead .
of the six tested candidates , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush were best cut off hon@@ esty .
a majority sees S@@ anders rather than hon@@ est@@ ly , but as with Car@@ son , many have no opinion .
the error rate for the sample @-@ sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters in the preliminary is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son is approaching to Donald Tr@@ ump at national pol@@ l
Ben Car@@ son is in the latest survey by C@@ BS News / New York Times with Donald Tr@@ ump
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the two candidates , half of the voters of the new pol@@ l fall , and others fall dramatically . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rep@@ ubli@@ can voters continue to support Tr@@ ump in large numbers . supported by 23 % in the last C@@ BS @-@ Quest@@ ionnaire , which was conducted before Fox News debate last month , 27 % in the survey from Tuesday .
but Car@@ son enjoyed the same period of 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son arrives with demo@@ graphic groups and exceeds the more of rep@@ ubli@@ can voters .
the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio @-@ Governor John Kas@@ i , is ab@@ rup@@ ted with Wis@@ con@@ sins governor Scott Walker , who fell lowest because of 10 % support in the last month to now 2 % .
the former Florida Governor As@@ b Bush , the former Governor of Arkan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio are at 6 % on the third place .
the error margin in the sample @-@ sample of 3@@ 76 people of rep@@ ubli@@ can voters in this latest survey was Plus or minus 6 % and was carried out in September .
the latest CNN / OR@@ C survey , which was released last week , shows that Car@@ son is increasing in the p@@ olls - at 19 % support for rep@@ ublic@@ ans , behind the dr@@ ump with 32 % support .
the most recent survey of ABC News / Washington Post showed also Tr@@ ump clearly before Car@@ son .
with a glance at one in the last week , Tr@@ ump found some side prot@@ ectors for former neuro@@ sur@@ geons , even after Car@@ son has ap@@ ologi@@ zed to question tr@@ um@@ ps .
&quot; we need energy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump on Saturday , during a battle showing in Iowa .
water temperatures : the Eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
even if top values are measured only in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is enough to find even warm water .
a bathroom in the North or Baltic Sea is likely to be a rather short time at maximum 17 degrees .
man@@ holes go no longer in the sea : at a maximum of 18 degrees the water is in the North and Baltic Sea in this week , the German weather Service shares ( D@@ WD ) .
there are also temperatures of the Mediterranean : in the east , it even reaches up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic sea it is 25 degrees in the top , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood with the death of a Bar@@ uch College new@@ comer
almost two years after a student died during a clas@@ sy ritu@@ als of a student union in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , then mo@@ urn for five persons .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College Pi @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Bru@@ ges attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an admission ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport into the hospital , which has contributed to his death , the police launched .
officers said that he was bur@@ dened with blind@@ ed eyes in a 30 pound backpack of sand and was repeated , while he tried to move over a frozen field towards a destination .
Mr. Den@@ g eventually compl@@ ained about head@@ aches , then he fell un@@ conscious .
the members of the Pi @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Bru@@ ges were not called the emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g had f@@ ain@@ ted and waited for an hour before they brought him into a hospital , so the police .
however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing , goo@@ gling his symptoms , and Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood to collect advice , said police officer Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; at this point , the members of the utensils began to hide and set the welfare of the Brotherhood basically over the form of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said police officer Wagner .
he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died next morning to his injuries .
after the aut@@ op@@ sy report Den@@ g was repeated with dum@@ b power of injuries to head , tor@@ so and th@@ igh .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for many families were destroyed by the Brotherhood of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies on the ch@@ ic@@ ans , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer , who represents D@@ eng@@ s Family in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; br@@ other@@ hoods and their members must be held to account , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Monroe recommended a charge of murder of third degree for the first five members .
two @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged for quer@@ ade attacks and formation of a criminal association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t only want to blame the parties involved , but if there is an organization that - officially or in@@ official - this will also act to account , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bar@@ uch College has forbidden the Brotherhood , and the Brotherhood has ref@@ uted their affili@@ ation to the city group .
that will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest rates
a interest raise comes , and the house will fall into the sh@@ anks , returns again for bonds , and the economy will slip into recession .
we know this .
what we don &apos;t know how long this will take and how long it will stop .
in particular , the history of the economy offers only small instructions for the economy .
a recession came after the first interest rate within just 11 months and lasted 86 months .
the aggres@@ sion of the Federal Reserve at raising the interest rates is often , if not always , a factor on how the economy and the financial investments are respon@@ ding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , representatives of the U.S. Central Bank under@@ scores vig@@ or@@ ously that investors should not concentrate on when it begins to increase the interest rate but rather in the period that is needed for norm@@ alisation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
several variables play a role in fact .
in the end , however , market participants could determine that the whole excitement was possibly ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first raise in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inev@@ it@@ ably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cheap money &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , Che@@ ster econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a communication to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we don &apos;t expect the gradu@@ al return of U.S. interest at normal heights , but still at low level to lead to the seis@@ mic shock , which seem to fear many .
this does not mean , however , that there will be no impact .
here is a historical trends based on how some areas of the economy could react :
as the market has seen in the past month , the pre@@ payment of interest &apos;s threats can be vol@@ at@@ ile for a while .
once the increase hits , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is apparently a tendency to assume that assets reflects only 12 to 24 months after the first raise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study about what is based on interest rates by the F@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more precisely , the market is usually in the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to interest rate hike , rather flat in the 250 days afterwards ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal level after 500 days , with an average yield of 14.@@ 4 per cent according to an initial analysis , published by Bob D@@ oll , chief unit Str@@ ate@@ ge at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management in Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
the Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the stocks tend to occur later in the increases cycle and the return with it begins to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest rates often encourage them .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is confron@@ ted with some conditions that could not give up and speed up the recession .
it is very remarkable that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point at a rate of interest .
according to Deutsche Bank , 118 percent of the European GDP had only twice the nominal GDP of just 4.5 percent since 1950 .
although the second quarter of 2015 stood at 3.6 percent , few expect that this will last years and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to the Atlanta F@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; interest rates in such a frag@@ ile economic setting could be ris@@ ky and throwing the question , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is different &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Deutsche Bank said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
market participants have made the whole year on a rate of interest of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were aimed at the Federal Open Market Committee that ends on Thursday .
while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this session , the Fut@@ ures Trading is only a 25 per cent of the lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study all the increases cycles from 1950 to today were held in a super @-@ cycle with growing momentum and on @-@ rec@@ essions very quickly following the beginning of recovery in the shadows , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by contrast , this is clearly a slow recovery of what is the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest which the F@@ ed has been waiting for the last recession years ; the record was 35 months , and these have been 74 months .
the fixed income was also vol@@ at@@ ile , as the market grows a rate of interest , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the impact of bonds is faster than shares if its strategic path changes .
with bonds , the returns seem to change once the first increase / lower@@ ing in the cycle .
at the end of the increases cycle , the bond yields now fall , the Deutsche Bank said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the strateg@@ ist on Charles Schw@@ ab believes that the increase in the interest rates is that yields from longer and shorter bonds closer together and lead to a bend of the curve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
high interest rates often bring improved yields in such climate , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come @-@ Analy@@ st at Schw@@ ab , in an analysis .
it is interesting , Jones believes that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation expectations there are some signs that the market has adapted to the pro@@ spect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the proceeds al@@ arms , l@@ ending @-@ ten@@ ths has increased , and the vol@@ at@@ ility have increased - all characteristics of the market if the F@@ ed has exac@@ erb@@ ated its strategy .
in the large and entire company , wrap up the larger part of its business in the USA will benefit if interest rates rise and local products more attractive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; multin@@ ational companies with high debt will be worse , as a rising of dollars will make their products more expensive on the global market and finance their debt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the history shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares tend to respond positively to three months after an initial interest margin , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gold@@ man Sach@@ s Anal@@ ysts said in a report for customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with a strong balance sheet have sur@@ passed companies with a low balance sheet after each of the Zin@@ o@@ gene@@ alog@@ ist 1994 , 1999 and 2004 by 5 percentage points .
companies with high capital yields and low vol@@ at@@ ility as well as low vol@@ at@@ ility ex @-@ stocks also exceeded their counter@@ parts at an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts become a major problem .
companies with a high proportion of flexible interest will lose most , Gold@@ man said .
outside the pure equity media , consumers will also benefit from the rising Dollar .
savings can be seen by higher yields , even if experts with different opinions will take place as quickly as possible .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM , says member of the Parliament Andrew B@@ ingham
the Parliament &apos;s con@@ serv@@ atives critic@@ ised the station because of its &quot; fool@@ ish@@ ness &quot;
he argu@@ ed that he is becoming increasingly different from commercial ri@@ vals .
he was also aimed at BBC Music Awards and said that they im@@ press only The Br@@ its

BBC Radio 3 &quot; converts &quot; to Classic FM , &quot; says a leading member of Parliament and increases new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does something that does not do the private broad@@ c@@ aster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the con@@ serv@@ atives , Andrew B@@ ingham , also said the BBC Bos@@ ses that the public broad@@ c@@ aster &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; digest@@ ing me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly won &apos;t be different from its commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; radio 3 appears - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; accur@@ sed &quot; - but it appears to become Classic FM . &quot; he said .
he was also aimed at BBC Music Awards , starting in December .
the BBC Music Awards , launched last year , seem to be just under a different name .
so , if you try to do something else -@@ this is two spontaneous examples , where you only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said .
follow @ F@@ ion@@ awe@@ bed@@ itor BBC @-@ Director presented the alle@@ g@@ ations back and argu@@ ed that BBC Radio 3 goes far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and clari@@ fication of the public .
what I &apos;m studying from Radio 3 , I &apos;m going to learn about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music , which is really un@@ matched .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and to present the commitment of Radio 3 , new music and to give new works on behalf , I think also for important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argu@@ ed that he tou@@ g@@ her to engage the audience as it did in the past as the British have kept fewer than classical music .
however , Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production , which during the hearing in the Committee on the choice of culture , media and sport began making commercial ri@@ vals to the feet .
the T@@ ory M@@ EPs in Dam@@ ien Collins hold The Voice to - the musical talent show of BBC , which was purchased by the Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for a estimated cost of Â£ 22 million .
see why this program is often discussed , because it is not original and not especially striking ?
Lord Hall insist@@ ed that the BBC 1 show - was produced with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as a judge - &quot; in special BBC @-@ mode . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added , he would like the company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house stable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; if it was the next time a entertainment series begins . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he ref@@ uses to exclu@@ de the order from other rows of The Voice in the future or give money to other maintenance formats .
net sales rose on the slow@@ est in August and the Black Friday can be responsible for this
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sale .
last month , there was the lowest result since the start of records in 2000 .
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones to buy
experts believe that the Black Friday slow@@ ed in November in November
for over a decade , the virtual shopping bag has been bo@@ oted , and many of the main shopping streets in Britain have turned into v@@ ast@@ al towns .
but experts say that there are no signs now that the online revenues were stag@@ nat@@ ing after new numbers showed just seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
overall expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the start of records in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say that there are no signs that online sales stag@@ n@@ ate after new figures showed just seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you regard growth rates for previous years and return until 2000 , that has always been developed during time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ R@@ G sales strategy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he stated that the online sales were increased three years ago when buyers began to comp@@ ose purchases with their mobile phones .
it meant that more people could buy online so that people could do this in different environments , e.g. home on the sofa .
but now , this comm@@ utes a moment , and we will probably experience that growth is reduced .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon , which was imported from America , is cited as a reason for post@@ ing revenues .
experts believe that buyers will hold their purchases before this event , which will take place on the last Friday in November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers will be on their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some res@@ eller websites attacked .
experts believe that Black Friday , in which the buyer wants to take advantage of bar@@ gains , killing buyer , to make purchases .
a study by the British Ret@@ ail Con@@ sortium found that Â£ 5 spending was issued a little more than Â£ 1 Â£ .
in some products , such as TV and washing machines , more than one third of these purchases are now conducted through web @-@ shops .
at the same time , more than a quarter of men buy clothes and shoes online instead of fashion chains in the city towns .
Muslims buried the dead in Mec@@ ca on the crane accident caused by Bin Laden &apos;s family .

the Ministry of Health said that 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane jumped .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , king Sal@@ man , the Bin Laden Group would not have to stand the arm of the crane , when he was not used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an Arab version of the decree , published by the State Saudi Press Agency , said that the Bin Laden Group was not responsible for the collapse .
the English @-@ language service of the news agency did not report this detail , but he said that the company &apos;s leadership has been banned abroad .
in the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man suffered to un@@ veil the fall of the crane , which crashed into a courtyard of the big mosque , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims fled from the H@@ add@@ uch that later took place in this month .
the Bin Laden group did not have any statements about the collapse of the crane , and their representatives were not available for a statement .

Mrs Ber@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , since eight out of ten buying decisions in the shop are hit by women .
at the moment , men weigh the men .
she said it was necessary to exhibit the growing demo@@ graphic trends which exhibit more female households with more renov@@ ations than in the past .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; there is still a majority of men in our branches .
we must move this more closely into an equi@@ libri@@ um .
basically , half of our customers from women occupy more than 80 percent of the decisions regarding the purchase of articles by women .
women play a big role in decision making .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , who ranked one of only five women from the top of a British in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also been structured to reflect a same number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ fis@@ her is almost the only company that occupies exactly 50 per cent of the team with women , including his management and Chief Financial Officer .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - variety is an important topic here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ fis@@ her reported a down@@ turn in half @-@ year earnings and sales , after the group pay@@ ed the costs of closing the stores .
for the trends , King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q has to open 200 new branches .
officials from A@@ ich / DO@@ B due to in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity on trial
on Wednesday two officials of the Austrian volleyball @-@ runner A@@ I / DO@@ B have to answer for un@@ faithful and par@@ atro@@ ph@@ ery .
the accused were not guilty of the accused .
one of them had been prosec@@ uted for counter@@ abuse .
he has been acquitted of this accus@@ ation in May .
the current process has been ad@@ jour@@ ned .
according to the At@@ tor@@ ney General Robert Ri@@ ffel , was cryst@@ alli@@ zed to cryst@@ all@@ ine that the accused in the years 2006 to 2011 had the strug@@ gles of the strug@@ gles to disp@@ ose in their functions , for private purposes .
this will damage the damage with around 400@@ ,000 Euro .
the sport@@ s@@ ers are also charged with financial problems .
this fact was divided by the chairman of the Sch@@ Ã¶ff@@ ler , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it should be negoti@@ ated at a later date .
the def@@ ences for the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity did not form the defense of the association , that , at no time , the association became an asset .
the sport@@ s@@ men should have invested only allowance for the sport club , which they have spent from 1982 until 2011 and invested in the debt of the debt . the Pas@@ si@@ va came approximately 600@@ ,000 Sch@@ illings in 2001 ( approx . 44@@ ,000 euros ) .
&quot; back then , we stood in front of the situation : do we continue our club or block us ? , &quot; one of the accused , in the bread@@ th of a bread@@ th of bread .
with his colleagues and co @-@ def@@ endants , he then decided to take on this task .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have fired money to put our life insurance as security during the Bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said when referring to . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the association it has been agreed : you can manage the money freely , no debts can only be made .
moreover , the withdrawal of the allowance for the withdrawal of the allowance was decre@@ asing by 1991 .
therefore , one part of the allowance is estimated only years later , namely the year 2003 when an plus had been on the account .
for this reason , the former Ob@@ servatory dropped out , and not detailed meetings .
the accounts and austerity books managed jointly by the two accused , said the second accused .
why the withdrawal of the association could not be revealed in detail , the judge asked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association was not interested in the financial support , it is important to only have the debt freedom &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2011 , when counter@@ ed investigations were launched , an amount of 120@@ .000 Euros was transferred to the compatibility account .
these were dec@@ lines , they declared the def@@ endants .
this securities account did not run on the name of the second def@@ endants , and was not known according to the association &apos;s testimony .
&quot; why ? &quot; I wanted to know the judge .
it didn &apos;t know an answer for a long time .
he finally said that he believed that this was the best for the club .
if something happened to him , no one would have known something of this money , the public prosec@@ utor dropped in the room .
the accused must have been informed , and the function@@ ary agreed .
this transfer was then form@@ ulated as &quot; compensation . &quot;
why claims of damage ? , judge judge and prosec@@ utor requested .
there@@ for the first accused , he did not agree with this form@@ ulation , because the association would never be damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what shall I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You are all from the tail@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ am I a jur@@ idi@@ cal ? &quot; he asked .
he also told the function@@ ary that he has never met a cent content , but he only counted o@@ dom@@ y and di@@ ets .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in di@@ ets , he was charged â¬ 1,000 per month , but the actual effort was much higher , he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
exact documents for the early years could not suggest the accused .
these are according to an operating audit in which everything was judged correctly , no longer be stored , they declared them .
o@@ dom@@ eter money had also referred to the second accused .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all surveys are made in cash , in addition to staying from his native international market to the Bank to Blei@@ burg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained in his statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the trial will be continued on 23 September with the survey of witnesses .
Hewlett @-@ Packard - more than 30.000 jobs
in addition to running , for three years , the computer mining company shall have further jobs when setting up the company .
there is no end to the positions in the US computer of the Hewlett @-@ Packard ( HP ) .
as part of its restructuring , the U.S. technology group plans to reduce the breakdown of 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customers .
this means that costs amounting to EUR 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion Euros ) will be saved on Tuesday .
the move will lead to an exceptional load of around 2.7 billion dollars , which will fall from the fourth quarter .
the breakdown of 55@@ .000 jobs have not yet been fin@@ alized since three years .
in the end of the financial year 2013 / 14 , HP employed some 30@@ 2,000 associates .
Hewlett @-@ Packard @-@ Share was 2.3 percent .
the newly @-@ licensed group from California Palo Alto is currently expanding : thus , the computer and print business will be bund@@ led again this year in a new society - separately from the reporting area with computer servers and data storage for companies as well as other services .
both parts are to be listed on the stock exchange .
a again disappoin@@ ting PC sales and a weaker demand for corporate customers after its services , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer would be upgraded to phone .
in the third quarter of July , the sales of PC and printers were reduced by 11.@@ 5 percent .
sales fell by 8 percent to nearly 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
the proceeds went back in 15 of 16 quarters .
HP answers with a break and massive positions on the change in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has only responded very late to purchase that customers can buy smart phones and tablets instead of conventional computers and do more and more business online .
Whit@@ mans restructuring expenses see a total of about 55@@ ,000 vac@@ ancies in total .
conflicts : majority supports the anti @-@ IS education mission
however , a direct participation of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would be overwhel@@ m@@ ingly re@@ sem@@ bling : 54 percent said against it , 35 per cent showed itself .
that other states of air strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria can be found by 61 percent .
24 percent are against it , to interven@@ e in the conflict .
in cooperation with the Syrian National Bank , Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad , 51 percent of respon@@ dents say 20 percent would be .
29 percent could not decide .
car : second press release on the 6@@ 6th IAA
by the 27th of September , the mass is connected , self @-@ prop@@ elled cars and electro@@ mobility .
following two press days , German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 6@@ 6th International automobile exhibition under the slogan &quot; mobility links &quot; on Thursday .
you can visit the wide public at the IAA .
the organizer of the Auto Union V@@ DA will count as two years ago with about 900 000 visitors .
R@@ Ã¶s@@ ke : political up@@ heav@@ al to Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police participated in the Serbian border with R@@ Ã¶s@@ ke Tr@@ Ã¤n@@ eng@@ as and floo@@ d@@ lights against several hundred displac@@ ed refugees .
Eur@@ ot@@ ch Cor@@ respon@@ dent D@@ Ã¡n@@ iel Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the violent coup at the border control point .
and he reported by telephone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
behind it a police line had formed and behind the police officers , a water designer was ready .
40 to 50 refugees began throwing rocks , st@@ aves and plastic bottles to the civil servants .
the officers went first to reverse the pepper spray .
afterwards , the police used Tr@@ Ã¤n@@ eng@@ as .
a lot of Tr@@ Ã¤n@@ eng@@ as was spra@@ yed in the direction of refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
the refugees have gone a little while now .
a s@@ cour@@ ge and apparently the last woman was born out of the zone .
children , who had met the Tr@@ Ã¤n@@ eng@@ as , cried out .
other refugees sank together and suffered under respir@@ atory problems .
the Serbian police also suffered injuries to the use of Tr@@ Ã¤n@@ eng@@ as and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for US emergency
the world watches it , when the US state bank accounts for two days , on Wednesday and Thursday to meet the important decision , whether for the first time since almost a decade the interest has been raised or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists , which were inter@@ viewed by Reuters , found that a little more than half , which will be doing this last week , now thinks that the F@@ ed will remain a little longer and will keep interest rates on the current level of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent .
it &apos;s a historic event since it &apos;s seven years ago since the F@@ ed interest rates down to zero .
&quot; for the first time , we approach to a situation where a large central bank leaves the zero area and starts a process of norm@@ alization of interest rates , &quot; says Angel U@@ bi@@ de , senior worker at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the U.S. economy is on a relatively good performance level , tr@@ illion dollars will be added to the balance and only generate a low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ro@@ sy outlook on global standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she warned the markets cau@@ tions to rise , but the signs indicate that the chances of such a step are good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision is to be announced at 8@@ pm CET on Thursday
death shar@@ k at Delta State University left exc@@ uses .
after shooting and killing his friend in Mississippi , on Monday morning - and before he killed his colleagues later on Monday - Sh@@ annon Lamb opened a note to say that it was &quot; sorry &quot; for the first murder and wanted to do it , &quot; said authorities .
police in G@@ auti@@ er , Mississippi , said that Lamb , professor of geography and social science at the Delta State University , announced the emergency number at 10 : 00 am Monday morning
and he said that he was shot on someone and someone killed .
Lamb spoke to the staff of the emergency telephone , that the police are sending police officers at his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just opened my wife yesterday evening &apos; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house , but he won &apos;t distur@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but probably upset . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the c@@ aller after his name , but he did not give him .
Lamb had no explanation for his shots .
when police came into the scene , they found the body of Amy Pr@@ ent@@ iss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 , said , &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted to und@@ o .
I loved Amy , and she &apos;s the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
after writing the note , Lamb rose 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , killed before leaving his own life on Monday evening when police officers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ ws said that he did not know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite the reports on Monday that Lamb believed that Pr@@ un@@ ition was also a relationship with Schmidt , said authorities on Tuesday there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; triangle attachment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cho@@ ing was Shawn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who told her about seven years married when a &quot; good man &quot; was described .
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said that he and Pr@@ ent@@ eat had a daughter who is 19 , and she &apos;s &quot; destroyed &quot; on the ground . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ un@@ ition were her daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
Pr@@ un@@ izza worked online from home , according to Lin@@ s@@ day Kno@@ w@@ les , who was identified by Sun Herald as a close friend of Pr@@ un@@ iss .
Kno@@ w@@ les said that Pr@@ un@@ iss , who owned a dog named Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; she wanted to help other people , &quot; Kno@@ w@@ les said
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lamb spoke to a certain date on Monday to say to them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he does not go to prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when police officers took him ride on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville , Lamb opened his car at the side , fled on foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
Lamb received a doctorate from the Delta State University in spring 2015 , as his degree of life from University of University .

Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa builds the Group by
the Lufthansa plans a large corporate restructuring .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year alone with a better organization .
150 of the world &apos;s about 1000 exec@@ u@@ tives will cost the workplace restructuring .
there is a new negotiations with the pilot union .
Lufthansa builds its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates the economic operator Euro@@ wings .
the aim of the real@@ ignment offers a contribution to profit of some 500 million Euros per year of cost and revenue , distributed by the airline on Wednesday .
among other things there is no longer a management board for the passenger business in Lufthansa .
the cost airline Euro@@ wings sol@@ es to be developed as stand@@ alone as possible .
in the end of the team , CEO Carsten Mehr@@ hr will be responsible for Euro@@ wings to be responsible for Euro@@ wings .
at the new exhibition , Spo@@ hr under@@ lines the importance of Euro@@ wings to face Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet to the future .
to date , the organization of the 120 000 employees was complex .
the airline operates under the umbrella of the Air@@ line Group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros .
new negotiations with pilot

that shared the union .
theme of talks shall be the retirement control for pilots .
cockpit &quot; wants to achieve a consistent results in one year with a consistent overall response .
the conflict between trade union and airline operations led to various strikes in the past months .
background is the pilot concept &quot; Wings &quot; next to the trans@@ itional supply of pilot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it looks ahead that the Lufthansa in the fight against competitors should be lag@@ ging out to the Group @-@ owned Euro@@ wings . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Luke Shaw of Manchester United can &apos;t play for months because of double Fra@@ ktur
at the Champions League of Manchester , Luke Shaw returns a double fra@@ cture of its right wing in the Champions League of Manchester .
while this became the left def@@ ender for the human body and close it for at least six months of playing , Louis van Ga@@ al will not hope that Shaw can play back in this season .
the injury was caused by a reck@@ less attack by H@@ Ã©@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno during the 15th minute after the 20 year @-@ old Shaw was broken in the PS@@ V range .
he was treated for nine minutes on the field and required oxygen before he was transferred to hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double ball and lies in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will move tomorrow or maybe one day later and then in Manchester .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is aw@@ ful - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United which is very difficult and then fits fantastic and then this happens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the hair cabin , he had an oxygen plasma .
he wept .
I am not a doctor , but if you have a double Fra@@ ktur , then it takes six months and will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to escape a red card and the suspension of a single meter .
Nic@@ ola R@@ izz@@ oli , the arbit@@ er , did not judge the Mexican .
van Ga@@ al thought that the Italian refer@@ ee had mistaken .
you can judge for yourself when I say that one penalty and a red card are due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
a twe@@ et on Sha@@ ft &apos;s account said : &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery begins now , I get back stronger again . &quot;
here : Manchester United suff@@ ers the loss of Luke Shaw at the defeat of PS@@ V
with the European Championship in France , the England advoc@@ ate has an additional inc@@ en@@ tive to recover from the coming June .
Phillip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V trainer , said : &quot; it is a very simple wound . &quot;
if a player leaves the square with this type of injury , everybody is very sad .
it is never the intention of our players to inj@@ ure a opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg in Mexico when Mexico had played against Van Ga@@ as Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he &apos;s very difficult because it was not his purpose to hurt his opponent , and if you hear it is a very bad injury , it isn &apos;t good &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Co@@ c@@ u said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball that was travelling in another direction , so it looked like him &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; touched him , but I could not see the attack on Luke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard this can be . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very bad doing so . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ Ã©s Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought into hospital - after a fall of Chris Sm@@ aller .
certainly David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
it is a matter that all parents will learn soon : if your child likes a book , it will not last long until you know it almost by heart .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked of a provider of care system , his favorite kid &apos;s book was asked to call his favorite kid &apos;s book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , which was released in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss in 1971 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a difficult choice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cameron speaking in a message on the website of the company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it is a book that I like to read my children , because it is always a picture or a message which we have missed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all well and good except that the following paragraph shows in which Cameron supp@@ os@@ edly describes the action of the book , instead a summary of the 2012 movie version which added new characters and details to extend the rather short original text . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the midst of the w@@ alled city Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all the nature is gone and even the air is a good deed , the heart of Audrey , to see the heart of Audrey , whose real name was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name was Theodor Se@@ uss Geis@@ el was held and the 1991 passed away , but completely unknown .
as if it wasn &apos;t yet suspic@@ ious : the text of Cameron &apos;s text is partly read , as follows : &quot; in the w@@ alled city Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial , and even the air is a good thing , hopes the heart of Audrey , to win the heart of Audrey , to the girls of his dreams . &quot;
although he ad@@ mits to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is entru@@ sted to the action of the book so little . here is a rebel@@ li@@ ous boy , like the local environment , despite the protests of the nam@@ ent lau@@ rel , a ho@@ ck@@ ling , schn@@ ur@@ ious Bein@@ gs , &quot; which is spoken in the name of the trees , &quot; it is rav@@ aged .
most likely , such a fairly low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per , which The Lor@@ ax did not read 20 times in a row a child .
a Down@@ ing Street Spe@@ aker said that the lyrics would probably have come by Mr Cameron &apos;s Choice Office .
super@@ camps confirmed that the text of Mr Cameron was delivered , but there were no further direct comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion from the British team , but it is still difficult
in Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates , a difficult task , but if one chose the Ka@@ der , who chose England for the tour , is a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat not on my map .
I would not exclu@@ de a one @-@ down victory .
Al@@ ast@@ air c@@ ooks page is possibly less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin players in the Batt@@ ing list , and the community spirit is strong ; they will bear no scars of 2012 , only a you@@ thful positive attitude .
with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali was developed as spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown size on test level , is an option for the attack .
this related news : Adam Ly@@ th is leaving the England @-@ Test @-@ Ka@@ der and is replaced by Alex Hal@@ es .
the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th is of course for me as his head coach in Yorkshire , difficult to analyse .
in its seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are facing up .
there was no question mark with Joe R@@ oot , for example , and this led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I &apos;ve said this before - players are their own best sel@@ ective .
long ago we have extended the run of Ly@@ th , but he had control over his own fate .
if he hopefully strikes finally more races in Yorkshire , there will be another chance .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss sang his attitude even if he didn &apos;t get such good results , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he &apos;s especially a team man .
the question , how much time a test b@@ ats@@ man receives , to set his mark is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton took nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and upwards .
the only accus@@ ation that could rise was that England was first introduced in Jonathan despite being a Ly@@ th in the Caribbean - but this lost opportunity is now in the past .
Alex Hal@@ es comes in and he &apos;s a striking and I guess .
he is a X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , which we saw in Yorkshire in this season when he was 236 with us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge spot , which met us very much .
he must pay at least the same chances as they were before him , but of course it depends on the team order in the United Arab Emirates .
in addition to Cook , the idea of going to kill any extra @-@ spin punch and four Qu@@ icks would get up , and I didn &apos;t do anything about it .
I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this link has already shown that he is a devil &apos;s d@@ ashboard from Cri@@ cket Player .
Mo@@ een perhaps did not do his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he &apos;s no big difference for her County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire .
my early te@@ amm@@ ate Justin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before joining a open@@ er in 2001 .
he made three hundred re@@ members immediately and looked not back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes in the Ka@@ ze as Back @-@ up @-@ Sp@@ inner , and in my limited approach he has impressed me as a young man .
people may see their statistics on an average of 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think , it &apos;s a Pun@@ t , but there is no big number of backup spins that raise their hands and the train@@ ers have chosen for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team , England has made some smart supplements at the train@@ ee .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ ding , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as advisor for the test games could be a coup .
he is one of the nic@@ est not@@ ices of the game , which will bring a wealth of experience since he has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes to the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and powerful use into the set @-@ up .
I always felt that he is created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and , like Mah@@ ela , he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can bring fresh air in the dressing box , even if the news are in line with the previously predicted .
coll@@ ys team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used for the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot has got a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it for my part .
some will not agree , but co@@ aches and team actors do not determine the schedule .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you must remember that as to players hin@@ ge their jobs from the results . &quot; &quot; &quot;
such decisions will not be taken lightly .

Germany &apos;s c@@ auti@@ ous German Chancellor Angela Merkel is a allies , but it has been in power for 10 years before it looks bad for them as it looks bad for them as Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years old ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and Kohl ( 16 ) has happened .
French President FranÃ§ois Hollande can look back on his re @-@ election or replacement in 2017 .
he is also an abandoned power .
Poland might soon become a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a left one .
it is hard to imagine that they are going to get a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie Br@@ its , whose energy should be better to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something they don &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ at@@ ist ten@@ dencies did .
hence , some such ministers can &apos;t deliber@@ ately plan un@@ helpful comments , quite in the SN@@ P style , during Britain &apos;s speech campaign in 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ xit process , I susp@@ ects my friend .
&quot; the new trial was a ple@@ ite &quot; and &quot; Great Britain has won nothing of its new hearing . &quot;
the Europeans know how r@@ ro@@ ber@@ y the Fle@@ et Street can be at their expense and which EU scep@@ tics were the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press bar@@ ons , but did not have it when Tony Ben@@ n was inspired by Tony Ben@@ n who supported our entry in 1973 to a 2 : 1 ratio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they may still remember Boris Johnson , the ore @-@ Euro Opp@@ ortun@@ ists who made a name for himself as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU @-@ Muslim ban@@ anas &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brussels Cor@@ respon@@ dent in the early 90 &apos;s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with all his mad@@ ness there knew Ed Mili@@ band who were his enemies .
the med@@ ley of tax @-@ caring schools , telephone @-@ h@@ ack@@ ening ali@@ ens and the p@@ seudo non @-@ In@@ jun@@ ct , belonged to most of our major newspapers .
actually , Tony Bl@@ air thought about them , but realized that when you sit with a hot Gor@@ illa in a cage , you get better ban@@ anas in order to di@@ stract him , rather than getting to its lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more bl@@ ai@@ ri@@ ans than Bl@@ air himself when he resist@@ ed the speech of his speech , because Bl@@ air had rejected the principle of un@@ adopted Constitution of the EU , which was rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened it a back@@ door .
the press has never forgiven him .
but the lovely Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly sla@@ p on his back home on Monday - I told him that he had no time more for me to re@@ lie@@ ve me - but in danger , Neil Kin@@ no@@ cks Bo@@ boy@@ cott Mur@@ doch fired a mistake back then and today .
it may take , but it must be a co@@ her@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me but surely with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ sofa has left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ ns official position of Europe is - I just put it in the development .
he says that we should remain in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside the U@@ ki@@ p traditional Bl@@ auf@@ en@@ vir@@ a tendency and the wild gra@@ d@@ der of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism can probably say Yes .
it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and TV this week , as the boy sc@@ out had fought in him , not admit that Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s appointment of the provo@@ ke John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell was a bad idea .
it re@@ minded me of the 70 &apos;s years , when his old father fought against on TV , loyal to his labour cabinet , not too far and lose his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys struggle was still more attractive .
but to fight for &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ i expression - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his comra@@ des and de@@ pu@@ ties with all reports on Monday evening .
whatever the sc@@ atter@@ ing Bot@@ tom @-@ Up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to con@@ vey that it has even touched me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all things in the stru@@ del of social media , a breeding ground of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is true to Cameron alien@@ ate no free map for Europe who allows him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the refer@@ end@@ ums for comprehen@@ sibility , as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks for sure .
but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s basic am@@ big@@ u@@ ties for EU membership - in line with its anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among the left dis@@ si@@ dents , for which the Nar@@ c@@ is@@ sm@@ us of Small Le@@ aning is a central base of dog@@ matic issues .
as with its majority vote to Nato - Tom Watson is firmly convinced that J@@ C will not leave any campaign to the exit , foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find in all a sense of its su@@ peri@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they have suspic@@ ious voters - to make conc@@ essions to the British , if this can be poin@@ tless ?
the US is already quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory government in power , what was re@@ minded on Monday at the start of the British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum .
experts critic@@ ise report by Public Health England about E @-@ cigarettes
the claims of a state financed agency , that e @-@ cigarettes are less dam@@ aging than smoking , from a meeting of 12 people , partly with links to tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts who had to write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , entered into a report by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigarettes .
he published the &quot; Basic Report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot;
however , some researchers have in@@ advert@@ ised the resi@@ li@@ ence of the data and pointing to the links between some experts and tobacco industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an editorial in the medical professional journal Lanc@@ et seized the &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ arily attractive foundation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; on which he founded his primary conclusions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; two other researchers have asked to write in BM@@ J and asked whether the claims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; build stone or sand &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , professor for European public health at the London School of Hygiene , and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor for Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on proof of effectiveness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said the public expects the public asser@@ tion that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current estim@@ ation is that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current estim@@ ation is that e @-@ cigarettes are about 95 % less dam@@ aging to a detailed review of references and modelling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , this statement will come from a single session of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to implement a model for multi @-@ criteria decision @-@ analysis ( Multi @-@ Crit@@ eria Dec@@ ision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to lead their opinions on the damage of various nic@@ otine @-@ containing products . the outcome of the meeting were summar@@ ized in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director was previously obtained by British American Tob@@ acco Central ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also signed the BA@@ T references to Public Health in a Sustainable Development Report .
one of the 12 participants in the meeting explained to obtain means of an e @-@ cigarettes product , but not the funding that he should have received from the tobacco company Philip Morris International to add them to it .
the reasons for choosing the members of the body are not supplied , but this includes several known E @-@ cigarettes champ@@ ions , some of which also specify a sector of sectors in the paper .
some other atten@@ de@@ es at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
the tobacco guidance of the P@@ he also took part in the meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; research work stated that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard evidence for most of the products &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however none of these links or limitations in the P@@ he report is discussed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no evidence that there is no evidence that e @-@ cigarettes have been referred to as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smokers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , Director of health and well @-@ being at P@@ he , said that BM@@ J claims had been re@@ acted before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second li@@ fel@@ ong smo@@ ker dies in his ad@@ diction .
all the evidence suggests that health risks of e @-@ cigarettes have been minimal in comparison , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects .
P@@ he has the clear duty to the information public about what is proof , and what not , especially if there is so much public confusion about relative dangers facing tobacco .
nearly 8@@ 0,000 people annually die of a disease with reference to smoking , and smoking the National Health system costs two billion a year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to clear evidence of current evidence that e @-@ cigarettes are not without risk , but show only a fra@@ ction of the harm being caused by smoking , we accomplish our national jurisdiction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
BBC should give up East@@ er@@ ders , he is a former chief of Channel 4 .
the former chair of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , has said that BBC should stop playing programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals should be &quot; their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the radio fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not broadcast by other UK stations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he critic@@ ised the BBC that they are broad@@ ly seen by a smaller audience , probably to place among the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and transmit@@ ters , like BB@@ C4 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the BBC @-@ General Director , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he tried to come in touch with the BBC for six years , with the BBC .
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are on order or send that even un@@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; Johnson said the Ober@@ haus Communication Committee in the context of his investigation on the future of the BBC .
if you want to stick the radio service , which I don &apos;t want medium or long term for a good idea , you should at least put its production on programs that do not make or commissioned .
they send The Voice in a first class window , because they want to achieve a very wide support for their future .
the idea that otherwise no one would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it &apos;s non@@ sense .
Johnson said : &quot; I do not see why a res@@ sive tax program is financed , which could also be financed without subsi@@ dies .
the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , ad@@ mit@@ tedly both self @-@ productions .
to be honest , other channels would give their right arm for that .
I will ende@@ av@@ our to see how this is to be public broad@@ casts .
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC at all .
Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series , the channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 said that the BBC is to blame for reviews &quot; because of the amb@@ itions of the people working there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the most popular broad@@ casts of the BBC will give you back to what the former leader of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC &apos;s shows were to sell as East@@ En@@ ders .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal niche programs can go to BB@@ C4 , but they can &apos;t be able to compete , but they fulfill their tasks , and they can argue on their apparent missions to just@@ ification of $ 4 billion . &quot; Well , obviously , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they lay them in a time@@ frame in which no one wanted to see them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to the radio programme Johnson added to the committee : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I need you to find a recur@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value from this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , you all think that you get a great value for Â£ 150 per year , but for people who is Â£ 150 a lot of money , ask me whether this is true because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC .
former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 leader David El@@ stein , who also said before the board on Tuesday , said that the BBC will test their Rei@@ th@@ ian Mission to educ@@ ate , educ@@ ate , and enter@@ tain . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said just little from BBC production would now officially classified as education - he said that it should be 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and it should change in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inform@@ ing and enter@@ tain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at public @-@ law television channels in Australia and Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to question the partnerships , El@@ stein , the BBC , should do more in areas like those of the pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a hand@@ ful of television is shown and with the commercial editorial allies , to make everything available online .
&apos;@@ Pro@@ o@@ Size@@ &apos; can control bra@@ ins through sound waves
the video shows how the Nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction at the moment in which they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound impul@@ ses .
scientists have bred worms with gene@@ tically modified nervous system that can be controlled by sound waves .
the tiny nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment in which they have sound impul@@ ses to be heard for the human ear to be heard , ir@@ radi@@ ated .
the impul@@ ses work by switching mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells that are gene@@ tically modified to carry the di@@ aph@@ rag@@ m channels , which react to ultrasound @-@ waves .
another topic : researchers can read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said that worms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ genetics , using ultrasound to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
S@@ re@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ ki@@ ani , researchers at Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , said the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the depths of brain stimulation , an invasive technique that gives electrical impul@@ ses to the brain of Park@@ inson &apos;s disease .
mut@@ ine@@ ers usually do not react to ultrasound , but Chal@@ ki@@ ani made sure they did it when they were surrounded by a fluid with micro@@ scop@@ ic bubbles .
the bubbles , found out , rein@@ force ultrasound waves , which penet@@ rate into the worms .
the enhanced ultr@@ asonic waves can be found on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels and found in the membran@@ es of some of the worms .
the sound waves cause the opening of these icons , and activate the cells they are assigned to form a report Nature Communications .
to create ultrasound controlled nem@@ ato@@ des , the Chal@@ ets modified the worms that some of their mot@@ ions have TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels .
when he turns on the changed creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ waves and transferred into the worms , where they turn off the changed mot@@ on@@ ons .
the method has some simil@@ ar@@ ities with Op@@ to@@ genetics , a ground@@ breaking tool enabling the scientists to capture and shift neur@@ ons with impul@@ ses of light .
but Chal@@ ag@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ Size@@ Genetics could have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light , that has to be revealed on an optical fiber to the desired place in the brain , a low @-@ frequency ultr@@ asonic scan can happen un@@ hin@@ dered and can be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily transform the ultrasound signal into a clinical setting for certain neurolog@@ ical treatments , &quot; Hal@@ as@@ ani said .
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

the Am@@ nesty video was viewed on Facebook for more than 100,000 times in 24 hours and was created using the advertising agency V@@ C@@ CP , the non @-@ profit artist with the graphic artist and Vo@@ ice@@ over artist who works for free .
&quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ C@@ CP @-@ Creative Director Matt Le@@ ver was amazed about the silence that was on advertising for the weapons fair - and thought : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we give them the campaign they try to avoid them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they played with the invention of a realistic f@@ ailing pattern , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s stronger with bright colours and animation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they did a fantastic job by helping us to shar@@ per the awareness of the sale of illegal acts of torture at the fair , &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es from Am@@ nesty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what we need now is a collapse of the British government and the guarantee that fol@@ ter@@ ers are not traded illeg@@ ally in front of our door . &quot; &quot; &quot;

eight golden rules for life in student halls
eleven years ago I moved to a student residence in a student residence , but still in the faith in Ber@@ ets and mor@@ ale ra@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the cl@@ amped smile of those who have sc@@ and@@ alized - and to the numerous , long th@@ ong complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be dist@@ illed in eight simple rules .
the entrance to student residence is ranging from slightly wa@@ ver@@ able to absolutely fri@@ ghtening .
it is temp@@ ting to sh@@ wat@@ ering : people tell where you come from where and where you can &apos;t love A@@ by@@ n , where you can &apos;t love Bel@@ m@@ ite nor love , because in ear@@ nest , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract , ha@@ ha@@ ha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like in opposition to those you would not speak , even if your lashes were caught fire and these fire extingu@@ ishers would be . &quot; &quot; &quot;
let people leave .
the rooms of people often turn into beverages , film , venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also the places where people attract people and bra@@ ce their under@@ wear .
regarding : do not remember to start with a relationship at the university
intro@@ ver@@ ted received a rough handling at the university .
her room should be a refuge , but many student halls form a room @-@ to @-@ room ti@@ pping culture that can lead friendly and socially and lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be hell for someone who is trying to recover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nothing in culture is permitted to tell you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I like you and I want our friendship . but you have to go away so that I can get the energy back I have consumed with you for interaction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
try to feel when a fellow student is exhausted from soci@@ alizing - and send it a text instead .
ap@@ rop@@ os cl@@ apping : do it .
a guy in my student halls had the idea that a closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship close by baking .
as you start the university on the high point of back mania , the knock at the doors of people , in order to imagine with a plate full of brow@@ nies , less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s welcome in the neighborhood , I &apos;ve got you something . so , and now please smile when I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
Home @-@ made delic@@ ac@@ ies are a good way to join friends .
your ro@@ omm@@ ates are committed to enter@@ tain himself and will eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
po@@ or@@ ly mixed lot of flour , sugar and fat , make people sleep sleeping when you knock .
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student residence halls .
of course , the cl@@ ut@@ ches of chicken is theft , but is it taking a drop of sp@@ it for your tea too ?
check it with the fat owner .
the chances are good that they say to use themselves , even when they cook inside .
when someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s annoying , and you have compassion - but try to deal with it as my room@@ mate who added a det@@ erg@@ ent of her milk to pun@@ ish th@@ ie@@ ves .
she is now in prison .
you should not make any noise , losing people from sleep or from work .
it is not only about being a decent person , but that you belong in the true sense of the Pro@@ ver@@ bs to people who sit in the glass house .
a girl on my corridor asked her neighbours if there is something to do with them , drum &amp; bass a bit qui@@ eter , because it is three o &apos;clock in the morning and she had an exam in the morning .
they re@@ acted with much more pur@@ er music .
when they finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , they kindly put their neighbours together for two hours before they fa@@ sten their own music , shut their door and went down to their three hour checking .
would it not be romantic if your future sp@@ ouse would come into the same residence halls ?
the other way round , it would not be quite embar@@ r@@ assed when you take a room@@ mate to her future her partner , taking her again and then see her every day and maybe experience how to bring her all the mutual friends to himself ?
of course , the heart goes his own ways - but if a hot fellow man is definitely not your future wife , try at least to enter your under@@ wear a little reason .
in the exciting moment , in which you are not@@ icing that someone has its key in its not closed room is the border between a Ul@@ k and mo@@ b@@ bing fine when it seems .
a good street is funny , but it takes only moments until it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
share by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson on security - but never miss any one &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sh@@ ampoo .
close your door , and put your keys in a glass of water , which you then put in the freezer - but t@@ ack@@ ers do not wear their poss@@ essions to the ceiling at no more than twice .
terra@@ ced houses for refugees , single @-@ extrac@@ ting , scre@@ amer
the real estate company Markus G@@ ild@@ ner builds a lot of money in the middle @-@ Frank@@ ish corner houses for people who do not have much money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need a living room , but also the only &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mother and the Ger@@ ling &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I can see how you can still build cheap and well today , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview .
thousands of refugees accum@@ ulate to the housing markets .
the entrepren@@ eur Markus G@@ ild@@ ner believes , how quickly becoming even cheaper living space : he builds inside a project terra@@ ced houses for refugees .
Mr. G@@ ild@@ ner , many refugees are pushing for the housing market .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus G@@ ild@@ ner : the mass of mass in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
because people remain in a big part here .
given the refugee flow , we need enough living space in the coming decades .
a quite ban@@ al , three @-@ storey detached house is the solution .
G@@ ild@@ ner : a row house needs the least square .
it facil@@ itates the integration .
it is different when people make people living in blocks .
each of the six houses , which are currently being built in the pilot project , consists of three units each for four asylum seek@@ ers .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a dining room .
it can be that many refugees are saying , it &apos;s peace again , I go back .
then the houses can be rebuilt easily after the respective needs .
how high are the costs ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : the price of 160 square meter floor space per house equals 184 000 Euro , without land .
that is super@@ man@@ age@@ able .
the construction lasted six months .
that is reasonable .
do the buildings have complicated their plans ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : legally , I have drawn my project correctly .
however , it always makes the threat@@ ening Dam@@ o@@ cl@@ es@@ sh@@ um@@ er special construction and pitch @-@ ordering .
gr@@ us@@ el@@ ig .
it is still under@@ going who creates three apartments in a terra@@ ced house , needs at least three pitches .
only in cities are missing the place .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did local residents react to their terra@@ ced house project ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : there was what they accused me of creating luxury structures for asylum seek@@ ers .
which definitely is not correct .
but don &apos;t ti@@ gh@@ ten the competition for affordable housing ?
indeed , G@@ ild@@ ner : it &apos;s true : we had a boom in Germany over the last five years , but a luxury apartments that could hardly afford any more .
my project has the message , even normal people need living space .
not only refugees but also the only one @-@ moving mother or the Ger@@ ing@@ ber@@ ser@@ er .
I can see how you can build cheap and well today .
that is why it goes .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update will be released
the new operating system can be requested by clicking on &quot; General &quot; tab , and then select &quot; Software Update . &quot;
if ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install it for Inst@@ alling .
some problems arise after installation , as they get an error message indic@@ ating that the &quot; software update is missing . &quot;
to circum@@ vent the problem , users are recommended to either wait until the ons@@ lau@@ ght goes back or attempt to update via iTunes .
the telephone itself takes you through the rest of the process .
this may mean the del@@ e@@ tion of apps to create space - but Apple has made it more likely to do this if you use a specific tool to delete it , and then re @-@ install it , once the process is complete .

Silvia MÃ¼ller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll and Frank MÃ¼ller ( from left ) take the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel rock parks .
furthermore , mayor of mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , econom@@ ist , U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schw@@ artz and As@@ endor@@ fs , mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also pleased .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in many places on the country physi@@ cians - As@@ endorf said good luck : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Frank MÃ¼ller will take over the practice rock stand there on 1 October . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while Ur@@ sel rock stops reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is standing still on his side in the next few months still with half a spot .
after a reconstruction phase MÃ¼ller again opened the practice on 12 October , until then he invested 3@@ 10000 euros in the premises at the St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us Road 6 .
it was sympathy on the first sight , when the field stops years ago Frank MÃ¼ller and his wife Dr. Silvia MÃ¼ller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , who currently graduate studies in the business and who wants to get into practice this year .
&quot; we always had in mind that the MÃ¼l@@ lers were good to fit into this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ tw@@ ausen and laughs ) .
&quot; when it was so far , I just called it up . &quot;
the idea was pleased the idea to operate the own practice in As@@ endorf in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity and constant contact to the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old MÃ¼ller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we want to get to know and support families over the years . &quot;
as an advantage , he also see his own boss .

&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy came out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia MÃ¼ller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll .
after the conversion , the rooms are modern .
we will offer more ultrasound exam@@ inations as well as long @-@ term and debit S@@ GS and need a speaking room more .

about 2000 patients come to Silvia MÃ¼ller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll every quarter in the practice rock charts , in the North German average level there are about 500 .
there is another home practice in As@@ endorf .
a positive side effect of the practice by Frank MÃ¼ller : the pharmacy remains according to the Ur@@ sel rock stand in As@@ endorf .
if no successor would have found , it would have gone .
if you visit the MÃ¼l@@ lers , you look at all in familiar faces : taking out the seven medical specialists and the cleaning force of the field .
with their part@@ ing in As@@ endorf an era will end , after all , the physician have practiced there for 30 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning , we had only two rooms , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; remember Ur@@ sel rock gro@@ ov@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the pair also has two grand@@ chil@@ ds and travels .
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees through &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now border controls are highly crossed on our border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Interior Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls on the Hungarian border are keeping up parallel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as before , it is clear that everyone who wants to present asylum claims to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the supply and security of the people stand in the background . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is clear , however , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Minister said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people need to know that we do not accept bound@@ less mig@@ rant currents , even beyond the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border .
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia considering &quot; corridor &quot; - Slovenia ref@@ uses
the Croatian government had previously suggested that Slovenia wants to pass on arriving refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany and can also build cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees .
but the Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ Ã¶r@@ kÃ¶@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar did not look like this in Lai@@ bach , however .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of Cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy the monitoring of the border - especially to Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the border with Croatia is already strongly controlled by the threshold of the Schengen area .
as the Minister stressed , Sloven@@ es wants to im@@ plant the limits for refugees but not abri@@ dged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every EU member must complete its commit@@ ments , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed Gy@@ Ã¶r@@ kÃ¶@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
like the Croatian government , the first refugees have already tried in the night hours for Tuesday to withdraw in East Croatia at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id in order to yield the registration .
in the Croatian police , she was able to pick up them in the corn@@ corn fields .
according to local media , they meet new refugees in Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik since then .
it &apos;s mostly about Syrians and Afghanistan , including numerous women and children .
life @-@ service and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days , his country with about 4,000 refugees , Minister of the Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic said .
in addition , buses from Pre@@ se@@ vo aboard the Maced@@ onian @-@ Serb border would have brought to the Hungarian border with which to date , Croatian and Serbian media reported on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the government in Belgrade suffered that it was to strike the people in order to include certain routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neither can we , nor do we do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to media reports , any@@ how in the early morning a first bus with about 50 refugees arrived at the border town of S@@ id , in the course of the day more buses were expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the in@@ mates have been traveling all night away from the 500 km distant Maced@@ onian border .
&quot; we heard that Hungary did so , so the police told us that we should drive here , &quot; said one of the refugees .
they wanted to travel to Germany , Slovenia and Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this could now actually be predicted for ob@@ servers already forec@@ asted in the Balkan Route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary a little further west . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive options for border control &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia &apos;s Internal Affairs Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic pointed out that his country for the case of a strong feed @-@ stream of refugees have prepared nam@@ ing appropriate plans for potential plant@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but details did not call it , but he pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive capabilities on border control &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you lead rig@@ orous controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has belonged to the EU partner since 2007 , and since then a good witness to the country through Germany as far as to the standard of border controls .
on the Serbian side , some 300 refugees were arrested on the Hungarian border line .
according to Belgian media reports , they had spent the past night at the border crossing Hor@@ gos , who leads to R@@ Ã¶s@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two cross @-@ border hormone and Back@@ i Bre@@ g continue to remain closed .
whether the remaining refugees want to go on to the Croatian border , is still un@@ clear .
the Serbian interior minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic tried to calm on Wednesday at a local branch in Hor@@ gos , after the Hungarian border has now been closed , after the Hungarian border is now closed .
it would not currently deal with very high refugee figures .
they could not say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country .
advis@@ er rates of migrants to - dangerous - Alternative rou@@ ghts
however , private Hungarian refugees have started distribut@@ ing the refugees on which alternative routes are drawn through Croatia .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area there are still 20 years after the end of the Croatian war still un@@ cleared min@@ ef@@ ields .
on Wednesday afternoon , Croatian police announced that a team of mine hits were sent to the border region .

the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed Chairman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ell@@ as and her colleagues should set the economic interests of the nation to all other things .
the central bank has a two @-@ time mandate from the congress : to maxim@@ ize US jobs and prices here .
but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have recognized that there is an un@@ written third term : financial stability .
and this third mand@@ at could be the X factor in a decision that is too tight to pre@@ dict them . it is announced on Thursday whether the U.S. economy is ready to be we@@ aned from the current short @-@ term interest rate to zero short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most of the economy shows that it grows soli@@ dly , the most recent turbul@@ ence could make the global financial markets the already c@@ auti@@ ous F@@ ed representatives to increase this vol@@ at@@ ility by the raising of interest for federal bonds - and it is only by one quarter percentage point .
&quot; obviously the labour market and inflation in the first place will be the most important thing that they watch , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pie@@ g@@ za , chief of the bro@@ ker@@ age company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think when they were looking for a pre@@ text to increase the interest rate , increased un@@ certainty around the global market is enough just@@ ification and still wait , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no con@@ sens@@ us about what the F@@ ed is doing is uns@@ ure by itself the financial market .
about half of the econom@@ ists recently survey@@ ed by Bloom@@ berg have predicted a rate for interest this week .
financial markets , however , expect a wait for the F@@ ed , with a key indic@@ ator that shows only a 30 % chance of raising the financial markets .
this indicates a drop in the stock market , if the F@@ ed increases the sentence , unless the o@@ at@@ ches are mil@@ der the stroke by promise that a further increase is far away .
on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial average increased by 22@@ 8,@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed @-@ politics maintained the sentence this week , John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
it would be a surprise when the F@@ ed would lift the phrases at this time , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if she does , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she should go very far in her statement to calm the financial markets , so that she will not panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argue that a rate of interest would calm down the financial markets , because it would act un@@ certainty when the F@@ ed would act .
even before a month , F@@ ed seemed to increase the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percentage points per month , the first little step in a slow deteri@@ oration of the mon@@ et@@ ar conditions which would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ell@@ as had said in spring and early summer , in spite of the complaints of liber@@ als this year , that more economical progress would be needed to expect more economic progress .
although the creation of employment in August slow@@ ed down , improving on the labour market in this year has been solid .
the unemployment rate declined to 5.1 % last month , the lowest since more than seven years , and close to the level which sees the F@@ ed as full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation was steadily under the year goal of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of clearly lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs them due to tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian Shepher@@ d@@ son , the econom@@ i@@ on Macro@@ media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the financial markets all over the world held up close to the end of last month after China had dev@@ alu@@ ed its currency .
the Dow Jones Industrial Average score fell by more than 16 % amongst its maximum , as investors feared that a slow@@ down in the Chinese economy would thr@@ ott@@ le global growth .
the market has recovered somewhat in this month , the Dow dividend is now almost 10 % below the high of May .
for F@@ ed representatives , the market turbul@@ ence influence complex calculation when one should increase interest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news on the weakness of the Chinese economy would not have occurred in this meeting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ lin@@ ers , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former member of the US state tank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now he predic@@ ts that they will wait at least one month to get the effects better in the handle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of un@@ certainty about what the impact on the US economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O@@ lin@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the global economy is neither the main ones of the F@@ ed , so they should not be included in their decision @-@ making .
but in the end , the F@@ ed currency authority is the world .
the influence of the Central Bank was in recent years .
the mere note of the then leader , Ben S. Bern@@ an@@ ke , in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could fit their monetary expansion &quot; &quot; tight &quot; , dis@@ b@@ anded the turbul@@ ences around the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ ro@@ uted , they can not only monitor the developments in another place , but also consult with other central banks and experts to obtain a better understanding for global economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her decision @-@ making is &quot; more art as science , &quot; Zach@@ ary Karab@@ ell , leader of the global strategy for asset management of the company En@@ vest@@ net Inc .
Jeffrey L@@ acker , president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month , that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of inter@@ actions on financial market movements , which seems to be associated with the economic fundament@@ alism . &quot;
L@@ acker , Members of the Federal Open Market Committee , set up for a rate of interest , cited decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example .
a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to lower their leader around 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions , &quot; despite a notable impact on growth in the US , &quot; said L@@ acker .
one year later , F@@ ed @-@ representatives of the cuts were revers@@ ed .
the F@@ ed should put aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis as the market crash of 2008 , Adam S. Poz@@ nan was a former member of the Committee on Bank of England .
the most recent turbul@@ ence do not come close to this level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly doesn &apos;t want to get into the situation in which she was afraid of a interest raise , because the markets excited &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; PoznaÅ , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics , said : &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act always contains the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until that is changed , I do not think it should be the time .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small Living Hel@@ ping for Refu@@ ge@@ es
more refugees arrive in Germany this day .
to prepare a warm welcome , not without the commitment of countless volunteers .
there are also a number of people in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da , who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seek@@ ers in the city .
to them Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is with her body and soul teacher .
she has always taught with her 74 seats .
every Thursday she is doing the asylum seek@@ er home at D@@ ill@@ inger StraÃe .
they will help refugees from Syria , Kurdistan , the Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German language .

Brazil &apos;s p@@ Ã¤@@ di@@ at@@ ric society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian foundation organisation SP@@ RS tries to clari@@ fy how important good nutrition during a lac@@ tation . it does this with the presentation of images of babies who are su@@ cking at breasts that are painted with represent@@ ations of un@@ whol@@ es@@ ome food .
breast milk consists of a variety of protein , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates , the babies provide all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers get caught , increase daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research results indicate that a higher calories consumed is not the only dietary change , which should make mothers .
a recent study conducted under the management of Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy eating pregnant women really affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ors .
unfortunately , a child may neg@@ atively affect the immune system .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ rie@@ der Spor@@ hall
the Bern@@ ese settlement approved the building lease to the 2.3 million expensive gym .
and he made an exception .
the roof can be sh@@ atter for solar installation .
the plans for the long a@@ waited gymn@@ ast construction on the Bern@@ rie@@ der sports grounds are step forward by step : in the recent council session , the revised construction entry was unanim@@ ously blessed without great discussions .
prior to that , the Panel had also made an application for a structural &quot; exceptional &quot; respected &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; from the valid civil plan .
with the exception &quot; this was the permit for a special form regarding the roof construction .
therefore a &quot; artic@@ le@@ bar with non @-@ ey@@ ed First and roof@@ top &quot; structure is to be erected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; background of the planning is the planned use of the roof surface for solar energy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thereby we get together a wonderful large south roof together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the session . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; during &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it again fell to the roof loop that should be prescribed for energy reasons - differently than in the development plan - under ten degrees shall lie . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the volume of the hall is significantly reduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is therefore necessary because the planning plan does not exceed any &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bern@@ rie@@ der overhead general rule in the rule of liberation leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is not a recur@@ ring project in the gym : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gym hall in the sports center is a community project of the municipality and S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
around 2.3 million euros are calculated at the cost .
grants are expected by the school and forth sports .
in the next proce@@ eding the building entry for the 18 x 36 m tall hall is now presented to the landing unit and for testing .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ Ãen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the P@@ ei@@ vis@@ berg hospital is to be closed early as planned - namely in 2016 .
Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) will become a new medical director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
the station and the majority of the employees move from P@@ ei@@ Ãen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
it shows the surprising plans of the county GmbH of the county , the Land@@ kreis Andrea Jo@@ chner @-@ White confirmed .
however , a decision on the Supervisory Board , and the Board of Directors coming Wednesday , 23 September .
if the plans were implemented , all of the nearly 50 employees would continue working at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ Ãen@@ berg .
the vast majority should move by fishermen and the further existing inside of the Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are available .
the employees who cannot go to Sch@@ ong@@ au is to be offered a workplace in We@@ il@@ heim , so Jo@@ chner @-@ white .
the employees are informed of their plans .
the change of termination has been triggered by Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Clinic since the beginning of our office and is now moving to a private practice in the close proximity of the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the question who will take up the successor was according to Jo@@ chner @-@ White , the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fisher@@ man &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; into the game , who was willing to take over leadership and change his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au as of October 1st . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au it means a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; evaluation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a spread of the offer in the area of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Internal Medicine &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; such as Jo@@ chner @-@ White . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fibr@@ ill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) speci@@ alis@@ es in interior trim and gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
passes for the next two years will f@@ ishers go with his team when the Supervisory Board is right , both houses carry , until then in the next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ ella , which has even more than 35 beds , should defin@@ et@@ ely be closed after almost 140 years .
the county has previously planned this for 2018 , when the ongoing renovation of the hospital was completed at the We@@ il@@ heim hospital .
Land@@ r@@ Ã¤t@@ ter Jo@@ chner @-@ White , who is also Chairman of the Supervisory Board , came towards what the house , which is owned by the Federal Council , will in future be used as accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I close it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it goes with the property , Jo@@ chner @-@ white could not say that there are several consider@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the short @-@ term care of Car@@ itas and a conference @-@ sy@@ chiat@@ ry are currently housed there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better could not happen , such an opportunity does not come back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fischer over the ha@@ zi re@@ location to the Le@@ ch , who was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and very understand@@ able &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real perspective on the fisher@@ man &apos;s house , in which fisher@@ man works for more than 30 years , has not given it .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to assume the position of medical director .
the hospital P@@ ei@@ Ãen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) has been in the last decades rec@@ orders from closure , departments were closed , such as the surgery and obst@@ et@@ rics .
the land@@ lords of the Rhein @-@ Neckar @-@ lions are demanded even in the evening ( 20.@@ 15 o &apos;clock ) on the Berg@@ ischer HC .
in Wuppertal , the tables leader in the Bundesliga was close to clear strength , but there is no need for arro@@ gance .
in the last season , the Bad@@ ener in the B@@ HC occupied a painful defeat and have something dozens of guards there .
Jag@@ dun@@ ning with two injured people at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers had seriously injured during their maize harvest on Tuesday afternoon by shooting .
during the super@@ st@@ ance during a corn field in Pr@@ at@@ au near Pr@@ at@@ au ( county Witt@@ enberg ) several h@@ unters have been on how the police told .
the 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year old man suffered severe injury and were brought to hospitals .
just like an accident it could happen , it was un@@ clear .
the det@@ ective police is determined .
missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate victims of violent crimes
a crime fiction has led the police for the body of the 16 @-@ year @-@ olds of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate .
in the inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old was to kill the young people and their bodies were thrown into a channel in Rock@@ en@@ hausen .
a 16 year old man from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate voted for a victim of violence to fall victim to violence .
the tor@@ rent of young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ en@@ hausen at Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , including the public prosec@@ utor and the police on Wednesday .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old was arrested as an equally suspic@@ ious 20 @-@ year @-@ old who was , according to the indication , and carried out the investig@@ ators for the site of the cor@@ p@@ se .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was reported on Sunday morning , after having arrived home on Sunday evening after a visit to a autumn festive in Rock@@ en@@ hausen .
looking for the young woman , investig@@ ators initially ran on personal bel@@ lies of the victim .
with question@@ ations of the friends and the acquain@@ t@@ ances of the Mis@@ sions , a crime fiction came up against the 20 year old .
the suspected perpet@@ rators lead the police to a channel in Rock@@ en@@ hausen where the body was found .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the authorities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the authorities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to authorities &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was killed and the bodies were put in the channel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be presented to the fun@@ nel at Wednesday , investig@@ ators put a bul@@ let for the load .
the immediate circumstances of the workers should indeed get further investigations .
refugees need accommodations : study warns of housing
the situation on the German residential market has been ten@@ se .
more and more refugees seek a affordable ble@@ ach .
the pressure on the housing market grows .
social housing is facing a challenge .
the distribution tests in the German residential market have long since begun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the upcoming refugees and job@@ seek@@ ers from the EU increasingly more people push for a market , which is already over@@ loaded in many large cities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they compete with low income citizens around the last affordable housing .
to meet the demand for affordable housing , we would need to build 400@@ ,000 new units by 2020 .
the result is a study on behalf of the association &quot; Social H@@ ousing . &quot;
for comparison : this year 26@@ 0@@ .000 units are completed in Germany .
around 14@@ 0,000 apartments are missing .
within the first three months of their stay , refugees were no longer required to live as asylum seek@@ ers in an initial accommodation .
many people then to@@ ast to the apartment market and line up in the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
according to the Federal Office of Statist@@ ical Office , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers lived for rent .
the negative development of the residential market is not only payable to the increasing numbers of refugees .
the study also represents considerable fail@@ ures in the construction policy of the past years .
Germany is facing a residential project before coming from year to year .
currently in the urban areas of the metrop@@ olitan areas around 7@@ 0,000 units , Matthias GÃ¼nther is compl@@ ains , author of the study .
they therefore stayed in large cities listed in large cities in the apartment rooms .
young adults continued to stay in the housing market for the absence of absence up voluntarily in &quot; Hotel Mama . &quot;
in large cities , the number of square metres per capita decreased for the first time in recent years .
to solve the problem , the alliance &quot; social housing &quot; suggests a re@@ boot .
new inc@@ enti@@ ves should boost the social housing .
this could be avoided by the under@@ gone tax and the basic tax for subsi@@ dised flats could be suspended .
an attractive tax write application is required according to the alliance .
the funding programme for refugee population of the State Bank Kf@@ W is already well received in cities and con@@ greg@@ ations .
a good week after the start was issued on Monday evening with 184 million euros already more than half of the available approx . 300 million euros .
now the project could even be build@@ t .
refugees have free funds : Croatia and Slovenia
according to Hungary , there is no more per@@ sever@@ ance , since more than Croatia vote on the path via Croatia .
Zagreb is announ@@ cing that the transit trip over Slovenia to the north without hur@@ dle .
however , the route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbour country Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I talked with the Sloven@@ ian minister of the Interior , and if it is necessary we will organize a corridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Croatian Minister of Interior R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia is between Croatia and Austria and is already a Schengen area .
the EU country of Croatia is not a Schengen Land .
after the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees came to Croatia in order to reach Western Europe .
500 people have come across the border at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , report the Croatian television station RTL .
Hungary had closed its border for refugees on the day before .
new laws , which came into effect on the same day , do out@@ maneu@@ ver@@ ting ordinary asylum procedures in Hungary .
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Mil@@ ano@@ vic stated : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can travel through , and we are preparing for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , they are women , children and men who want to live and want to achieve something .
however , people who are not wanted to live in Croatia .
in the morning , the Croatian police arrested the first refugees from Serbia &apos;s border to the EU neighbourhood of Croatia .
according to media reports , most of these media reports from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came both by bus and taxi to the Serbian border town , S@@ id .
immediately after her arrival , they &apos;d have tried to get on foot across the green border to Croatia .
at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , refugees are not crossing the border .
there are other dangers facing the border : there are no sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ v civil war in the 1990s .
mine clean@@ ers now quickly create a secure passage .
after Hungary , however , after the closure of the border , there are hardly any more refugees .
the day was limited to 366 people on Tuesday .
shortly before tor@@ rent on Monday , there were 9@@ 380 been .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new Hungarian laws have the over@@ coming and damage of the border with us as an off@@ ence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
35 criminal proceedings were therefore initiated in the South Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
up to five years and deportation from the country stra@@ igh@@ ten@@ ing from the country .
according to the Immig@@ ration Authority , in the newly built @-@ in &quot; Trans@@ itz@@ ons &quot; border , in total , 94 asylum claims were received , of which almost all - 93 - at the most important transition R@@ Ã¶s@@ ke .
among the applicants , 13 families with small children and two older people .
on Wednesday morning there were still 40 refugees .
practically , no one has granted a view to get asylum in Hungary .
according to Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; secure third country . &quot;
the ired asylum seek@@ ers should be deported .
before the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Trans@@ itz@@ one &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in R@@ Ã¶s@@ z@@ ke only a few hundred refugees assembled . &quot; &quot; &quot;
workers started to fr@@ aming in R@@ Ã¶s@@ z@@ ke .
they collected the garbage burning of thousands of people in the road@@ side in the past few weeks .
Lock layers were dismant@@ led and a re@@ location in the border town was rebuilt .
nobody wanted to express itself .
Austria after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary just few refugees .
moreover , the country has stepped up its border controls .
but around the 20,000 migrants were still in the country .
some 1400 people are waiting for the continuation of Germany in Salzburg .
the train traffic from there to Germany was hal@@ ted by the German authorities in the morning .
both outdoor chips met regularly smaller groups of refugees on foot .
mayor continued &quot; over@@ ran &quot; across the border
&quot; we were busy at the BrÃ¼@@ cken@@ fest on Sunday with the premises when there were suddenly ten people with trav@@ ellers on the entrance of the tent , &quot; said W@@ ern@@ st@@ eins , Alois Stad@@ ler .
tourists , they wanted to go by train to Pass@@ au .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because Germany had dis@@ continued its aid on Sunday because of the refugee flow in Austria , it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at W@@ ern@@ stein &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; so Stad@@ ler who instantly sens@@ ed his help and the stri@@ pped together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars on the border to the Na@@ he Pass@@ au . &quot; &quot; &quot;
before we have only tast@@ ed the un@@ hop@@ ed guests only once , with lunch and drink .
we said the same , we get them by car to Pass@@ au .
&quot; of course , &quot; this was of course , &quot; says Stad@@ ler in O@@ Ã@@ N conversation .
they were very grateful .
a man had not allowed it to give a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire brig@@ ade .
&quot; that pleased us very much , &quot; says Stad@@ ler .
on Sunday evening , the over@@ threw train pass@@ ers were in a regional train towards Pass@@ au on Sunday evening , in order to proc@@ laim it after the short @-@ term promise that rail traffic was dis@@ continued to Germany , yet to try again on the border .
the Regional Express was cancelled due to the border in W@@ ern@@ stein on the Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein , the border crossing is generally high in the course .
the BrÃ¼@@ cken@@ fest connected with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday , day before a branch of a branch was spor@@ tier - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
Viktor Or@@ b@@ Ã¡n can now send a further tens of thousands upon us , is a logical result of a apparent policy :
instead of helping together in R@@ Ã¶s@@ z@@ ke the establishment of structures to help human@@ eness , our chan@@ cell@@ or officially opened the position of a Hungarian government to the Dun@@ lop of National Socialism .
the bodies of these politics are not only those Austri@@ ans who are confron@@ ted in the fron@@ tier areas with cha@@ otic conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the poultry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ground &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should also be determined that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yellow country &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which she has invited and welcomed , nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a big challenge , given the ongoing refugee flow and the coming winter to make decent conditions for protective seeking . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and there will be one more bigger - peace , security and stability in Austria .
finally Conrad in search of 35@@ .000 winter days
Konrad has a lot to do with the refugee camp all hands .
Christian Konrad is used to have his word weight .
the government used the former Rai@@ ff@@ eisen ban@@ ker to provide accommodations for the thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the First Center of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , Konrad had already got the handle .
&quot; we didn &apos;t have any homeless more in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported of his first success .
the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday must be without great action , &quot; Konrad and sang the organis@@ ational &quot; master@@ y . &quot;
however , the Ministry of Interior talked about a &quot; ris@@ ky situation . &quot;
a whole , Konrad with a demand of 8@@ 5.000 quartz were counted in the he@@ ur@@ sty year .
in order to meet the number , more than 35@@ ,000 accommodations will need to be found in the next few weeks - 20.000 are expected to provide 15,000 people .
should it become more refugees , we can do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is not a barrel without ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already had talks with the national cent@@ ur@@ ers .
these could have secured him , even to lo@@ dg@@ ings for the upcoming refugees .
&quot; it is good in Upper Austria , &quot; said Ferry Mai@@ er .
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph SchÃ¶n@@ born , which shall be clari@@ fied , as the church will help .
big expectations give the asylum coordin@@ ator even to the ORF @-@ action &quot; Help as we . &quot;
on the platform private persons can offer un@@ complicated accommodations .
in addition , one hopes to live in hotels that are empty in winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; finally , Konrad and Mai@@ er critic@@ ised the standards for housing to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in case of not@@ e@@ ti@@ des , it can not be that lo@@ dg@@ ers must have a certain height of towel rack or size of lift .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a temporary period , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should apply . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by contrast , in contrast to the Interior Ministry of the Interior , Konrad had to do with his experience .
I am an older gent@@ leman , who one does not tell without further in his face the un@@ truth .
convic@@ tion is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Mai@@ er do not cause the republic to explain how they declared themselves .
their number of employees want to increase them to three to four .
to date , their lo@@ dg@@ ings had not yet been successful .
Konrad wanted a container to present a container at step@@ han@@ splatz as office .
but there are apparently problems with the permit .
Linz calls for better distribution
first , no opening of municipal sports halls and other buildings like Tips @-@ Arena and Design Center for placing refugees is planning the city of Linz .
if this is not necessary , as one can currently account for those measures without these measures , mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) says .
further sites are to be checked for an emergency .
criticism of the city of refugees in the division of refugees in the federal country .
other districts have to be performed here .
See@@ hofer : &quot; borders will not be blocked &quot;
in a longer telephone session with the Bavarian prime minister Horst See@@ hofer ( CS@@ U ) , N@@ igh@@ man Josef P@@ ehr@@ inger ( VP ) has added another procedure in the refugee survey on Monday .
See@@ hofer gave me as@@ sures that the German borders will not be sealed .
re@@ discovery of refugees in the Federal Republic of Germany remain possible .
however , there are now the respective limit controls .
special trains with refugees to Germany will not be giving any more .
however , the protective sho@@ ots would lead to Germany with regular trains .
the stir@@ rer asked once more increased solidarity in the refugee question from the other EU member states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , that Austria will again lead to its borders with its borders , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logical episode &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a logical episode &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a Mat@@ ter of Time
the over@@ hau@@ st of the &quot; New ship@@ yard in Lin@@ zer Industry line is officially completed .
in four of the six floors of office and production building , the publicly traded IT Group S &amp; T , the rest ( 2700 square metres ) is intended to be rented out to young , innovative companies from the Technology business sector .
&quot; in IT , smart heads are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T Chief Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er .
he could imagine to invest in start@@ up companies in the new ship@@ yard and later on which to sack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; starting from the very beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - which has promised quite a few things : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a question of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
â¬ 1.7 million was invested by S &amp; T in the location , 3.3 million euros from Tech@@ Center , which is one third of the city of Linz , the Land of Upper Austria and the Federation ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is le@@ ased out of the Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ Center .
at 30 per cent of the 2700 square metres floor space in the building are already rented , for a further 40 per cent of the qu@@ eries .
L@@ ia @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ t@@ ress opened second business in the arcade
in the new shop , Fur@@ la hand@@ bags are at the centre of the centre .
any@@ how Jutta intends to agree with a dog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this project had to shift 49 @-@ year @-@ old sin@@ cer@@ er from L@@ ia Per@@ oni to the Tau@@ be market arc@@ ades : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , she has now been able to gain momentum in the form of a further business location . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Fur@@ la @-@ Shop across the business , in which it sells bags , bags , shoes and clothing of different manufacturers , all about Dam@@ age@@ hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are now available starting at 75 euros .
bigger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop is in operation since yesterday .
prior to that , several weeks have been rebuilt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have over@@ laid a long time if I want to open a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says broad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision for the decision was that also the Fur@@ la producers , who are home in Bologna , from the idea of a site where only their hand@@ bags are sold . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we are the only child in the big city of Linz , who sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters , who own Italian roots .
their fashion interest has grown widely from her mother to cra@@ dle .
I stum@@ bled upon most , if something is developed and I can show new trends at competitive prices .
why some woman looking for a nice hand@@ bag in tran@@ sc@@ rap@@ ture , the professional lady can &apos;t answer with last security .
perhaps it is because a beautiful bag val@@ or@@ ises every outfit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ etter from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Palat@@ inate ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose inhabitants are called investors .
this property also connects with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US President .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for lively .
if he expresses grave host@@ ile , journalists are concerned or knowledge g@@ aps in the international crisis of crisis - the candidate for the US presidential campaign had power@@ fully en@@ du@@ red the campaign .
and cuts off well .
this is also registered in the Palat@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt , where grand@@ parents were from the real estate billi@@ on@@ aire .
the New York with the F@@ Ã¶h@@ n@@ fr@@ is@@ ur is a concept of many in the Win@@ zer@@ dorf on the Wine Road .
some in the 1200 inhabitants space is more than -@@ ty corners with it related to him .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Palat@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in election mode .
the K@@ all@@ stÃ¤d@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del sp@@ un a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about his goal , the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think they find somehow interesting , but not so deeply impressed by the worse kind , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German @-@ born K@@ all@@ stÃ¤d@@ ter has shot an am@@ using documentary on the place and his famous sho@@ oth@@ s , among those in addition to Tr@@ ump also the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump , who is not known for hum@@ ility , comes to word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2014 ) - so with the statement that he would surely be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has not brought it to the king of hearts .
certainly I give respect for the family &apos;s performance , but also tend to think that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; being a bit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bit of big lazy &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; by chance the nickname &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ etter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - at the point of the point , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ etter - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so Tr@@ ump comes from the village of the geber .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 1885 when the future grandfather immig@@ rated , and in the USA a local bre@@ wery was opened for gold mines .
foundation of the estate company were first sales in New York .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : her wish to return to his homeland for a long time , failed by the Bavarian state to which the Palat@@ inate was then .
he did not shoot Tr@@ ump because he was once sold without permission , the director of the Institute of Physi@@ cian History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , had declared the film start .
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of a &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot;
that is in contrast to the not@@ ing statements of the desc@@ end@@ ings .
who had repeatedly spoken off to Mexican immigrants in the US and urged to build a border wall in order to fri@@ gh@@ ten illegal immigrants .
&quot; as does the pol@@ o , this is not so symp@@ a@@ thetic , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative tr@@ um@@ ps ( &quot; The O@@ ma was a beg@@ otten Tr@@ ump , the Op@@ a was born Heinz &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the win@@ emaker in retirement has rather dist@@ orted to the Americans , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is always so in@@ viol@@ ently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he believe that Tr@@ ump comes out ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine this , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never took care of a city . &quot;
the pension management in Veron@@ ika Sch@@ ramm mentioned , like man@@ chers K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter that a desc@@ endant of the Heinz @-@ family came to a visit for the church organ , which was generally well received .
&quot; I cannot imagine that Donald , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are better if he does not be@@ have the choice , for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views . I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if those , who had the sessions at the time of his grandfather in the USA , would have been like him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics like him , &quot; says Win@@ sm@@ el@@ ter Sarah BÃ¼h@@ ler .
and as its president ?
&quot; my President isn &apos;t , &quot; she says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are also ripe without the President . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Karl Stef@@ ano@@ vic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son rush to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report on the loss of leadership of the liber@@ als , but there has been no major shi@@ fts in the ratings for Today .
the run @-@ run of Nine was broad@@ cast@@ ed by the German capital , as Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ it abolished the overthrow of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .

this dis@@ advantage of the insur@@ rection seemed to play a role for Australian TV spectators , since sunrise showed an average of 39@@ ,000 spectators at the five capit@@ als , in comparison with today &apos;s 33@@ 9@@ ,000 .
today , Today , a slight increase over ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but his number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former serial number of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ter Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama on a recently @-@ wit@@ ched father , which decides to settle down to his two children on the New Zealand coast , has a very impressive number of $ 1.@@ 219 million spectators .
critics have wondered if Thom@@ son could carry a hit @-@ show solo without the ra@@ fting Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong at 1.@@ 136 million viewers and easily hit The Block ( 8@@ 38@@ .000 ) and T@@ BL Family ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) .
Seven had mixed results at evening two of The Chase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17.@@ 30 ) of the new quiz show , hosted by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ e@@ fe , was on average 44@@ 6,000 viewers .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) jumped on 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Eddie Mc@@ Gu@@ ires hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
secret revealed ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki are apparently looking un@@ clear who wins the Bachelor .
the woman , finally , when Sam Wood , finally landed in The bach@@ elor &apos;s house , was sh@@ ro@@ ud@@ ed in biggest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three left @-@ born girl will certainly not give up whether she is the one who has received the last rose .
but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows on the day before they came out from three two , you may acci@@ dentally put a clu@@ e on who will be the winner .
Sam Wood is holding up his lips and sealed up for the final on Thursday
all three women have settled in ly@@ rical ways about why Wood is the perfect man and called his mind for hum@@ our , am@@ bition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they like to be a partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , when the question is asked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If not you , who should receive W@@ oods last Rose &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; their responses to the destro@@ yer , who won the heart of the tor@@ ch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called both quickly - besides himself - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other from the first day .
&quot; from that moment on , when I went into the house and saw Sam@@ s energies , I felt that they were quite compatible , and I thought it was quite compatible all the course of the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows .
&quot; Sarah stands on Earth with both feet , it &apos;s so much fun to be together with her , &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added .
I saw them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she and Sam Wood are well suited as a couple .
from their point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the house@@ man &apos;s visit could make it clear that Wood might be &quot; one . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as I saw it with my friends and the family , it became clear that this is obviously not just a game - I &apos;m firmly bound to it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when asked what Wood should be asked , if not them , they were pu@@ zz@@ ling .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said .
I love the left @-@ loving girl equally - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor &apos;s Bachelor is broadcast on top ten on Wednesday , 19 : 30 PM .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ es had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle have showed great interest after moving to the USA - and there were many other teams that sent an un@@ preced@@ ented training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ek chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and coach Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a wise decision .
some train@@ ers were re@@ leg@@ ated to the bench for the rest of the game when he lost a bo@@ om@@ angel , as he lost a com@@ edy in his first Pun@@ t @-@ league with his first Pun@@ t return on Tuesday at the 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minnesota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ nes the next opportunity to return a Pun@@ t @-@ Return and also in the current game following a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula continues to show his true face in the dressing cabin .
instead of having left his ro@@ ok@@ ies prior to the rest of the team through the mill , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ s@@ ula grew so publicly in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Sport rep@@ orter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ on was also encouraged by special teams coordin@@ ator Thomas Mc@@ G@@ aug@@ he@@ y , who advised him to forget his pat@@ ron@@ g@@ at and to take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ es , in a Pun@@ t , was restored in the first quarter of the Minnesota Code
it was certainly not the start that Hay@@ ek and his massive Australian bran@@ dy was hoping for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ek left the playing field after the F@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy at 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he could not introduce himself to his N@@ FL career .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a thing that &apos;s coming forward now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ ne said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ on compared the car@@ ver with his Origin back in 2007 when a passport at his own in Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Queens@@ land .
overall , it was a great experience for the 27 year old .

part@@ ing and leader of staff Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned for the beginning of the FW @-@ autumn @-@ sur @-@ grand@@ son in front of a serious crisis on Bay@@ erns schools , if it is not a new teacher for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to preserve the schools in front of the collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; otherwise we will get au@@ dits in the Bavarian education system . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Sunday fra@@ ction of the Free voters will lead to the Lower Sax@@ on Commun@@ e until Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other major topics were actually plan@@ ed .
but the record number of refugees now domin@@ ates the free voters .
&quot; of course , the subject of Ne@@ eds to over@@ lay the clo@@ ister , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN protective zones for refugees in Syria , as they gave it during the age of Yugoslavia in the n@@ ine@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not going on , we have to go to the causes &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the Free voters chief . &quot; &quot; &quot;
exp@@ ired asylum seek@@ ers want to push the Free voters as soon as possible .
so , Ai@@ wan@@ ger also demanded more staff for the courts that are responsible for asylum seek@@ ers : &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seek@@ ers , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the FW @-@ Chef critic@@ ized that several federal states are not consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need nationwide common standards of federal states . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria is wrong , others not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we need to be more competent . &quot;

however , Ai@@ wan@@ ger does not go far enough .
&quot; the topic of G9 must be accelerated , &quot; said the FW @-@ boss .
we call for free speech for all gymn@@ asi@@ ums that want this .

4 people killed , after police shoot rubber handles on protest@@ ers in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal , after the police fired rubber cover into a crowd who demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , said an official on Wednesday .
the violence broke off on Tuesday evening in the Rup@@ an@@ de@@ hi district , 175 miles west of Kathmandu capital .
B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ k@@ al , senior district officer , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators gathered outside a police station , and some of them cast stones and fire@@ bomb .
Mr D@@ ha@@ k@@ al said the police had used Tr@@ Ã¤n@@ eng@@ as and shot in the air before she pushed back to rubber .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it wasn &apos;t immediately clear why the rubber scra@@ p used are known to kill them , which are traditionally used as a le@@ thal alternative , obviously having such a high death rate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the debate was the last in weeks of violent protest at Nep@@ als southern levels , where members of the ethnic group of Mad@@ hes@@ i say that new provinces being formed under the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence .
there was also protests in Western Nepal from the ethnic group of Th@@ arus who want their own state .

H@@ ie@@ ve project : details are lying on the table
the planning for the resort &apos;s resort in the small sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the Investor showed the first public plans for the project .
a lot of An@@ li@@ eger is more troubled - they fear the sale of their recre@@ ational refuge .
for months he was negoti@@ ated behind closed doors , fried , deb@@ ated and drawn .
the plans for a new holiday resort are located on the small sea near Em@@ den in the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Inter@@ est@@ ing , the medium @-@ sized company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; System construction &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; made public plans for the first time at the end of the Council of the Em@@ den Council on Monday evening . &quot; &quot; &quot;
originally , this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
under the pressure of the project leaders and the F@@ DP group , presented by investors and management of the Secret service management , Ralf Behr@@ inger entered the offensive again : &quot; we did not have an answer to all questions , &quot; he said before the members of the Council , and more than 50 visitors .
but it is good to be able to meet all rum@@ ors now .
for months around ten to twelve million euros of expensive projects have been in the discussion .

&quot; &quot; &quot; he is also fear@@ ful like many other research leaders that would increase traffic by the intended size of the plant : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all buses have to come , so that it does &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Schulz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what happens exactly on the good one hectare of the real inn is happening , however , is still open .
still there is no operator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , we have to have a conclu@@ sive concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Behr@@ inger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this still lack@@ ed , even the development plans are still variable .

for easily obes@@ e di@@ abe@@ tics , weight loss surgery can be helpful .
the benefits of losing surgery for slightly obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes may take at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say if easily over@@ weigh@@ ted people with diabetes in weight loss surgery may live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the death @-@ data need a long time to show something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert on weight loss surgery , which wrote an editorial to the new J@@ AM@@ A Surgery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
weight loss operations or obesity , use different methods to shr@@ ink the size of stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s own ability to absorb nutrients .
over the years , obesity has proven to be efficient in type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been carried out by humans that are disease @-@ obes@@ e with a Body Mass Index ( BMI ) of 35 or higher .
BMI , a certain degree of weight in terms of size , is regarded as normal between 18@@ ,5 and 24,@@ 9 .
a BMI of 25 or more shows that someone is overweight and obes@@ e with a BMI above 30 are regarded as obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BMI here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , researchers from Tai@@ wan@@ ans min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data , which they have been collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes by people who were easily overweight .
the average BMI below those underwent this operation , sun@@ k from 31 to 24@@ ,5 until the end of the fifth year in this study .
separ@@ ating the BMI , the non @-@ surgical basic treatments were received approximately equal to 29 .
among those who under@@ goes a surgical procedure , in 36 % , the diabetes condition dis@@ b@@ anded and dis@@ b@@ anded at 28 % .
in the medical @-@ treated group , diabetes dissolved completely only in one percent , and in part with only about two percent .
the results of the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ ceri@@ des , and &quot; poor &quot; LD@@ L cholesterol , &quot; in general , were better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group &apos; , the authors found out .
the researchers also monitored the patient blood level of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c is held at best below 7 percent , write the researchers .
after the operation , the average hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c decreased by around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
however , in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at around 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ cem@@ ic control &quot; - as is reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c level - did not dimin@@ ished the mortality rate in five years , so the leading researcher Dr. chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also contrac@@ ted average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight ( 18,@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , reached bigger decre@@ ases in the BMI ( 7.4 % vs. 2.1 % ) and reported rather a complete over@@ coming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show a survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , Black@@ stone says from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study , there was obes@@ e people who underwent a obesity operation , about 29 percent less likely to die during 15 years - compared to a group that conven@@ tionally manipul@@ ate the conventional methods .
although the new trial was not an advantage for survival in surgery patients , Black@@ stone said that it is re@@ ass@@ uring for people with a BMI below 35 , which are interested in the process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study , because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BMI group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney illness , she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors do start weight seriously , as soon as the patient is between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we wait too long till we take people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think once they have accumulated these genetic changes they have firmly bound her body with obesity and diabetes is a revers@@ al . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; it &apos;s impossible for anyone to come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe can not record all the refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution of the refugee crisis in the Middle East said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist leader began to stop violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama spoke the problem of the serious refugee crisis to the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech at the inauguration of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion in Oxford that focuses on eth@@ ics studies .
it asked that under the circumstances , the interests of humanity should be asked before the interests of individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the reaction of the West European countries ad@@ mira@@ bly ad@@ mira@@ ble to the refugee crisis , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech .
although the Dalai Lama Germany and Austria was respon@@ ding to the crisis of the crisis , he emphas@@ ised that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions , like real peace and real development , mainly by education , for these Muslim countries &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he emphas@@ ised . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ultimately , we must pon@@ der about how the killing is reduced in their countries .
we must reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the application of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; he added .
the Dalai Lama spoke to the problem of violence and also commented George Bus@@ h@@ &apos;s act after the terrorist attack on 11 September and issued the violent reaction to the USA a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences to President Bush , and I told him the way to solve this issue lies in non@@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he put violence , and that made ou@@ tra@@ geous consequences &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
4 times increase of intake of disinf@@ ect@@ ant disinf@@ ect@@ ant by children in the past 4 years
poison gas centers in the United States report about an almost 400 @-@ percent increase in the number of children under twelve years of age , containing heavy mixed disinf@@ ect@@ ant , such as the Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , cases of revenues of disinf@@ ect inf@@ ant in children under 12 years of age reported in tox@@ icity studies , of 3.@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are becoming more common in these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them will follow in the emergency room , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CNN . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that some children can deliber@@ ate disinf@@ ect@@ ant , while some do to im@@ press their friends , or for a mut@@ test in the social media .
show videos on YouTube , how young people are drinking disinf@@ ect@@ ants only because of a cheap experience .
you@@ ths have supp@@ os@@ edly mixed lot of disinf@@ ect@@ ant with alcoholic cold water to receive a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think this is bad for it , &quot; said Lop@@ ez .
many of the most attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant ) are those that are perf@@ umed .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange du@@ ets which are very pleasing for children .
disinf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 per cent alcohol .
very few cor@@ ters can lead to alco@@ ve pois@@ oning very particularly at home children .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the Gif@@ t@@ ler Center at the University of Kansas , the Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City .
so , you would not let go si@@ p whis@@ ky , but people leave these hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants in reach of children , and if children come to it then it is a fast way to consume much alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year old girl who recently taken four sp@@ lashes of after straw@@ berry du@@ f@@ ten@@ inf@@ ectious substances in school , was taken into an emergency room .
their blood @-@ alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold , considered to be drunk by an adult , Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey said that she treated the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ all@@ te her words and was unable to leave when she arrived in the emergency room .
doctors shut herself over night in a separate children &apos;s hospital on signs of brain trau@@ ma , as the girl had fallen by the alcohol and had disturbed the head , she said Rit@@ ch@@ ey .
&quot; it was very wor@@ rying , &quot; Or@@ toria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ affir@@ s &apos;s mother , CNN .
it could have been deadly for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use soft @-@ free products or disinf@@ ect@@ ations outside the child &apos;s reach .
three disinf@@ ect@@ ants were linked via alcohol pois@@ oning .
in 2013 , two women died in Ontario women following the swal@@ lowing of disinf@@ ect inf@@ ectious agents which contained a toxic , non @-@ declared entry .
employees of health authorities suspected that the product contained meth@@ anol which contained a fatal solution , rather than eth@@ yl alcohol , which was noted as an active substance .
in January , three students planned to poison the fourth class in the state of New York , their &quot; reported &quot; to pois@@ oning anti@@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; thus report a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to mould disinf@@ ect@@ ants , and ban@@ ished them from their room .
the police over@@ looked the failed plan as &quot; D@@ w@@ Ã¤t@@ z &quot; and rejected inter@@ disciplinary action to the authority .

former Rang@@ ers @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national team of the Netherlands Ronald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic , because there &apos;s no title rival to Rang@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Ajax , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Holland , they show no highlights of the Celtic games more and why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is because the Rang@@ ers are not there .
people here are not just talking about the return of the Rang@@ ers .
they talk about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested in .
there &apos;s a lot of tension in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m games and there are not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn the things around , swe@@ ars De@@ ila .
R@@ onny De@@ ila has accepted that Celtic Cl@@ ay has to fight , but the Norwegian boss s@@ wore to turn things around .
following the defeat of MalmÃ¶ and the subsequent retirement from the Champions League , the defeat was followed by 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , which now holds with five point lead clearly at the top of the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; De@@ ila said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Celtic people had bad times before and we will come back again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
I know , it &apos;s very fru@@ str@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happened .

why I Will Be a Fore@@ ver in Oklahoma
a little later , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is put to death .
if it happened , and I hope it will not happen , I will sit in an audience gallery in the death chamber in Oklahoma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Glos@@ s@@ p is expressed by the po@@ isons .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
the invitation was issued for the first time in January on his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
when the day drew closer , I began to fear .
so , why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the USA , and there are often more applications than places available , finding a mak@@ eup &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lot@@ tery &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to decide who is elected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media slots from 12 to five .
who will be selected , will see it emotional .
I can &apos;t do that .
I am sitting next to Richard Glos@@ sy &apos;s closest friend , with whom I had developed my own relationship over the months with calls and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
often we laugh a lot , when we speak .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prison authorities say that I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to take a notebook and a pin to record what I see . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from Oklahoma acc@@ uses me on Twitter to give up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner , how he wants it and you get access .
I compl@@ ained about her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she recogni@@ zes that it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it could have been better phr@@ ased , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but she still thinks it is wrong , what I do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard Glos@@ s@@ p had problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
he does not tell me what I have to write , and I would not do it even when he would do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he wants an international rep@@ orter to write there .
when he dies , he considers that public relations work will help the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a replica of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit beside me .
if you want to know more about the case , please hear the series of Podcasts that I have made .
I don &apos;t want to enter all details here again .
I can &apos;t say to certainty that Richard Glos@@ s@@ p is innocent .
his acts after the assassination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of a favor .
but I believe that a strong lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood is that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe it is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe his execution is wrong .
and I will see him dying from this perspective .
I can not claim to be real objective .
there will be other rep@@ orters to which you can turn for .
what you can get from me is what it means to see a man a necessary death .
man after mo@@ ist police ch@@ ase did exc@@ el to come from the C@@ anning River
the C@@ anning V@@ ale polic@@ eman remained dry when he talked to the man by the C@@ anning River .
an attempt of a man from Perth , down the police , was successful , when he was standing in sil@@ ky and sw@@ amp@@ y water , just a few meters from a police officer , who tried to persu@@ ade him to persu@@ ade him to return to the shore .
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale was called by C@@ anning V@@ ale on Tuesday to call home @-@ headed incident in Bec@@ ken@@ ham .
when they discovered the susp@@ ect , he tried to escape them in the direction of C@@ anning River .
but he didn &apos;t come too far .
&quot; he stood in the water and said &apos; I &apos;m not coming out , come and get me , &quot; says Senior Cr@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ le@@ dine .
Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too excited to make his uniform wet , so he turned a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; A good polic@@ eman is negoti@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ le@@ dine .
championship football player Ben cou@@ sins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 , cou@@ sins sailed his car into the tren@@ ch to escape a alcohol control and then tried to swim above the Swan River .
his efforts were successful , but enthusiastic native people to the hum@@ orous planning of a Ben Cou@@ sins bi@@ athlon .
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards tried to blow him out and threat@@ ens to end the racing
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria tried to install a spy on his st@@ ables last year and threatened to stop the race immediately .
he aimed at the ste@@ wards and the integration of Racing Victoria and claimed they had a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai for a race @-@ day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media , that he always tried to do what is best suited for racing and for himself , having found himself under difficult conditions , when it was about the positive cob@@ alt @-@ up@@ heav@@ y@@ sample at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he had taken back 18 months due to the es@@ pi@@ on@@ age accus@@ ations and didn &apos;t want it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; look like high @-@ hanging grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it and I have sat on it long , but sometimes you &apos;re so fru@@ str@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you know that it was a far@@ ing .
sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences and I have to live with what I said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to keep raised head around , and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if they start to think , I don &apos;t do that , then I shouldn &apos;t be a coach .
I need to think about what I do with my license .
prior to that Moo@@ dy made the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com , leaving the integration process tried to exhaust his barn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; eigh@@ teen months Ter@@ ry Bail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart did in a room with a man - whom I am asked - and give him a job in my st@@ ables to give information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy to Rac@@ ing.com . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they clearly believe that I am an im@@ it@@ ator .
if that is the case , they will surely deal with their n@@ oses , because they have attempted to gras@@ p me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , eh@@ em . Chairman of Route L , David Moo@@ dy , President of Route L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of Route L , were aware of that time and are still today .
should I bring that opinion , that it is personal ?
did the Route L be@@ have to be@@ have and will perhaps blame people outside the train@@ ers , what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
perhaps the people think outside that I am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps they will take my license and reject me , and I have no doubt about what I say to think about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but I arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad .
it really makes me sad .
I will put pressure on them and pushing them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Fru@@ str@@ ations level of the Train@@ ers was based on the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt investigation in Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching led to the fact that he was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; throwing his licence on the table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Moo@@ dy , best known by his preparation of the immort@@ al master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , described the race @-@ day treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; after a pack was s@@ worn by mud or clay upon the bre@@ eds .
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I must take over full responsibility for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; one of my staff er@@ ci@@ ously applied mud on the leg .
it could have been so yesterday evening .
it could have been so yesterday the whole day , what was so .
but it had also on the racing day .
Moo@@ dy may be confron@@ ted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for treatment with the pack at the race day . an investigation of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules , do not know the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you have gone too far , &quot; Moo@@ dy said .

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy strikes against rival due to alle@@ g@@ ations to Ring@@ ers
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy has seen criticism of the Tac@@ kling of his player as &quot; Agenda Set@@ ting &quot; by two Premier League favour@@ ites of the N@@ R@@ L .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sydney Roo@@ ster trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson told the refer@@ ee of the Storm @-@ players &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ring fight &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with his team during the qualifying finals in Sydney on Friday night . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Brisbane Bron@@ cos Trainer Wayne Bennett has made a close note on the Storm @-@ Team after his crew had reached the final victory against North Queens@@ land cow@@ boys on Saturday evening . he called the game a &quot; Mu@@ ster@@ o@@ unding &quot; by Rug@@ by League and said that the two of Queens@@ land were not &quot; good &quot; to go well in ingen .
Bell@@ amy defended the T@@ ack@@ li@@ mg of his team and said they are just concentr@@ ating on their &quot; contact with the Tac@@ kling . &quot;
Bell@@ amy added that the cr@@ iti@@ que of two leading train@@ ers on his crew meet him , as it means that they were worried to be beaten by the Storm @-@ Team .
&quot; it dives all over and over again - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke of Ring@@ tone , when she told us 24 : 2 , &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday .
I can guarantee that we have changed the whole year nothing at our def@@ ensive system or techniques . but in the past six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ kl@@ es a real focus , and that made us the turn@@ around for us .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now and he obviously has a great team to practice . he is probably not used to lose , so it was a bit of shock for him .
it is funny as it always emerges again in this season .
Bell@@ amy inspired the idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and inspired his ment@@ or that Benn@@ i St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; te@@ di@@ gem . &quot;
Wayne is speaking of exciting football .
he had compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday night and how exciting her play was , &quot; said Bell@@ amy .
I remember that in 2010 , St George was critic@@ ized as a boring team , and Wayne said that he will take care of a divor@@ ce .
but now he has a team that can play and play as exciting , especially its young players with their speed .
that &apos;s the ball game you want to play if you have this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of soccer - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play like this .
I like stronger trust because they say these things , because they are a bit worried about to play against us .
six weeks ago , they were probably not thought of us when it went around the Big Games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against Roo@@ sters achieved a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos vs. cow@@ boys .
the game of Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two further attempts in our game , but is this an exciting game ?
or are breaks and no points a bit clamping ?
for me it is the game boards .
if they mention us , it means that we will meet in one phase still .
the Storm team has released this weekend at this weekend , as it won the right to receive either North Queens@@ land cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks the next Saturday evening in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales start next Tuesday morning .
Ser@@ bier with 200.000 $ deposit to drug addic@@ ts
a man , which might be a life @-@ long punishment because of his attempt to come into possession of 40 kilos of co@@ ca@@ ine who were s@@ mu@@ g@@ gled to Queens@@ land , was released against a b@@ ail of $ 200,000 .
Marko Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men arrested after the last month after the Federal Police found 100 kg of the drug on the Yacht Sol@@ ay and handed over from South America via V@@ anu@@ at@@ u and in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed , as he met his co @-@ def@@ endants in the early noon and later in the CafÃ© Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota echo .
despite a potentially life penalty for the attempt to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was argu@@ ing that he tried to inherit the entire amount and that in the CafÃ© could have been quite harmless .
the judge on the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan , was worried about the danger of death at Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he declared the court on Wednesday .
for the Trial Chamber , he lied to the police on his residence .
Mak@@ si@@ mov@@ ics &apos; mother and step@@ father had offered a deposit of 200,000 dollars as security to achieve his release .
&quot; after reading the aff@@ id@@ av@@ ory statements of the two people it is clear that the edition of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; Judge Flan@@ agan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but that alone will not suff@@ ice to stop him from it , he warned . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was released from b@@ ail , under the conditions that he canc@@ els his Australian and Serbian passport , rep@@ ut@@ ters on the police daily and is at an cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .

a truck with three trucks on the motorway 5 at Karlsruhe was severely injured in the night evening a truck driver .
two of the three cars involved in front of a permanent building in the direction of Basel .
the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to turn left at the last moment , as the police told .
the executive house of the accident caused completely apart .

Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used phone of girls to l@@ ure ped@@ oph@@ ile to sending images
a ped@@ op@@ hil@@ ari@@ er used the phone of a 11 year old girl to demand images of child abuse .
Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the phone of the girl than this slept , log@@ ist@@ ed into an online mess@@ aging service , which he received a set of un@@ decent pictures of children who were sent from another user .
the girl later woke up and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping dog@@ .
she saw it , she found conf@@ using messages and al@@ armed immediately her mother .
the police took care of the five images , analyzed the computer who were found under the address and discovered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; web research which used the search for in@@ ongoing pictures of children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ og@@ g then said to the officers he had done it as it would lead to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ped@@ op@@ hil@@ es &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; There was a polic@@ eman to fri@@ gh@@ ten them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the At@@ tor@@ ney General E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on said the Dun@@ de@@ e Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be a seek@@ er to fri@@ gh@@ ten people .
he answered that searching for the computer were done by him , but he said it was done because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to fri@@ gh@@ ten ped@@ op@@ hil@@ es .
he asked for his convers@@ ations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and he asked him to send more pictures .
he said he did so to l@@ ure her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said that he was sick when he drinks , and he said he wants to see pictures of rape and murder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother and was at the trem@@ bling and crying .
she then looked at the un@@ decent pictures on the telephone and confron@@ ted the accused .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and told that the accused of computers and play@@ station used to talk with girls who saw a lot younger than he .
H@@ og@@ g , 23 , Ward Road , Dun@@ de@@ e , pleaded not guilty to having received un@@ decent pictures of children on the 14th of June last year , on 25 January this year to have appeared against the uprising and not to be appearing before the court hearing on 24 March that year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; defence lawyer Gregor S@@ im asked that H@@ og@@ g doesn &apos;t appear in the register of sexual off@@ ences , since you could argue that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no considerable sexual &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can be found in his hiding place . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff A@@ list@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael swallowed up the judgment of October to get background reports about social work .
H@@ og@@ g was granted in this case , but was held on hear@@ ings of other cases in provisional custody .
it was still taken before the date of the Jud@@ gment in the directory of sexual off@@ ences .
floo@@ ding so@@ vers up to small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more refugees are attacked away from the major con@@ tro@@ ll@@ ing points at the German @-@ Austrian border .
many hau@@ sters made out of fear discovery and capture people aug@@ mented at smaller border cross@@ ings
on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police said .
along the river river Inn , more than 1,000 refugees have been picked up in the county of Pass@@ au and R@@ ott@@ al @-@ Inn since Tuesday .
they were on foot via bridges and shr@@ ubs to the German side .
there they are taken from police officers and re@@ direct to registration .
in the Munich central railway station , more refugees met again after the weekend of Wednesday at the beginning of the weekend .
at 8.00 pm only 700 people arrived at the country &apos;s capital , said a spokes@@ man in the morning .
after the re@@ introduction of inspec@@ tions on the German @-@ Austrian border on Tuesday , 17@@ 59 refugees had reached the town .
Stuttgart : out@@ po@@ uring of tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; in the southwest
meteor@@ ologists war@@ n from winds in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon .
due to a deep @-@ pressure over Western Europe , hot sea air currently streams into the country by the German weather Service ( D@@ WD ) in Stuttgart .
the strong point of the drop was Henry &apos;s , who was in the past few days from the Bermuda Islands over the Atlantic .
storms and thunder@@ storms are mainly waiting in Baden .
according to D@@ WD is still in the Black Forest to close to Thursday , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the soil area with bows ranging from 60 to 90 kilometres .
the sun will therefore again be visible on Friday .
for the last two years the car will show their new developments at the IAA .
2015 is mainly concerned with the compact vehicles that are currently selling particularly well .
cars coming from the compact class are currently particularly popular : around 2@@ 8.1 percent of new regist@@ rations carried out according to the federal Bundes@@ amt ( KBA ) alone in August on this segment .
this is reflected at the IAA ( public stage , 17 to 27 September ) .
this year , all of these futur@@ istic concep@@ tual vehicles and luxury cars will be presented above all many new compact models .
one of the biggest fo@@ oth@@ s for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will be held by dealers in the autumn .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair .
it belongs to the core of the brand .
the volume model is also being sold well , but the new Astra is expected to become much more expensive .
Opel will launch a start @-@ up beneath the largest competition in VW Golf with 17 650 euros .
the current Astra costs 16 990 Euro .
the Astra boasts a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with a 74 kW / 100 hp engine .
furthermore , the H@@ esse will offer more diesel and gasoline engines ranging from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , for the first time three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines are included .
unlike the most important opponents from VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is available only as five @-@ fifth .
the second variant will follow in the spring of com@@ bi , which is already visible at the IAA .
and what will happen next to the Astra at the IAA ?
Renault MÃ©@@ gan@@ e : Renault is sending the fourth generation of its Astra competition in the race .
at the fair the MÃ©@@ gan@@ e is only available as five @-@ five in a conventional and a sporty GT @-@ version .
in trade , it comes to the beginning of next year , also as a com@@ bi .
Infin@@ iti : brand new in the segment is Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan towing truck wants to find its position in the growing segment with the new model .
the compact Infin@@ iti adap@@ ts itself fully into the brand &apos;s design line with its curved lines .
the basic model will get a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
but there is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Suzuki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Suzuki Bal@@ eno who is its world premiere .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and a power of 82 kW / 111 hp .
the maximum torque is 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) according to manufacturer data .
the Bal@@ eno sales launch in Europe is in spring 2016 .
DS 4 : not completely new , but completely new is the compact class R@@ DS 4 compact to be seen at the IAA .
outside on the outside , the designer of the luxurious Citro@@ Ã«@@ n det@@ erg@@ ers placed themselves at the front end . here , the radiator grill was re@@ produced and the revised head@@ lights were equipped with LED technology .
in the interior space the inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system was moderni@@ zed , reducing the number of buttons by touch@@ screen and first integrated Ap@@ ples Car@@ play .
in the compact class , a series of over@@ working and new variants such as the new Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 308 GT@@ I was added in the compact class .
J@@ VA Berlin Te@@ gel : five square metres of cells are decent
the Federal Constitutional Court has been entitled to an ex @-@ det@@ ain@@ ees of the Te@@ gel law firm which was to be found on a small cell during the months .
due to the violation of their human dignity , det@@ ain@@ ees generally claim financial compensation if they are accommod@@ ated in too small cell .
this decision adopted by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday .
according to those people , they can even hope to make money if they were locked in tight spaces for a few days ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
as a result , an ex @-@ in@@ mate was successfully accommod@@ ated with his const@@ itu@@ tive agency in Karlsruhe . he was accommod@@ ated in a single cell with around five square meter floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was spacious not separate .
after that , the man , who according to his lawyer , was once again placed on the free foot in a bigger cell .
his civil gen@@ esis due to the un@@ worthy detention conditions against the land Berlin failed .
however the judges took up the judgment of the Chamber of the Court in Berlin and re@@ directed the case to the renewed investigation .
they see the man &apos;s human dignity hurt .
Chamber of chamber now decides about the amount of compensation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although for legal reasons only a few days of arrest for the compensation were author@@ itative , it was given an ob@@ jection to it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise it would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worry of the law of the person to fear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chamber should clari@@ fy the amount of the money &apos;s compensation .
the judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past .
thus , in April , they said to compens@@ ate for damages because he was naked in a cell .
a decision from 2011 , according to a decision , the multi@@ al@@ location of a cell without a separate toilet .
in addition , on Wednesday , the Berlin Constitutional Court also confirmed a decent housing to a det@@ ain@@ ee in a parall@@ el@@ ism in November 2009 .
the then @-@ time K@@ lÃ¤@@ ger was over three months daily between 15 and 21 hours in an appropriate cell , like in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
the Berlin j@@ ails had come to the head@@ lines in recent weeks due to lack of personnel .
therefore , det@@ ain@@ ees will always be en@@ cir@@ cled again 23 hours , while the aggres@@ si@@ veness arises , even to pun@@ ish@@ eries it must have already been per@@ ished .
according to the Justice of Justice , 21 positions in Te@@ gel are not occupied because of recru@@ it@@ ment lack , 19 should fall away in 2016 .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we &apos;re creating this &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the chan@@ cell@@ or is determined to assume it .
what comes to Germany ?
according to forecasts from the Federal Ministry of Higher Education in Germany this year , about 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany , according to Vice President Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany even managed to record a million refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) demonstrated in view of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can do this , and we can do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what comes to Germany is convey@@ ing the following overview .
it will be needed according to different progn@@ oses between 3@@ 500@@ 00 ( estim@@ ation of the Federal Ministry of Ministry ) and 400@@ 000 ( estimate of the pest@@ le institute ) apartments annually - and for the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it has to be built ( 25@@ 0000 apartments ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lack of housing is dramatic , but above all for affordable rental objects : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; annually 600@@ 00 to 800@@ 00 social work out of the rental budget and for these particularly cheap apartments will apply for refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) , therefore , wants to double in funding from 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
much too little is that from the point of view of the pest@@ le institute : 80 000 soci@@ al@@ ments per year would arise and therefore , the Federation would have to invest some 6.4 billion per year .
in addition , scientists and federal govern@@ ance agree that there must also be more tax rul@@ ings on investment in residential construction .
according to estim@@ ations of the Institute for Employment Research , about 55 percent of the poultry in Germany can be employed .
however , in Germany , the refugees in Germany would not system@@ atically be asked about their qualification to help them publicly , with Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
for the integration of refugees , however , it is crucial if they find work in Germany .
work is the key to social contacts , for este@@ em in the recording company , but also for the este@@ em of immigrants , says Mig@@ r@@ ation@@ for@@ scher Dietrich Thr@@ ut@@ hardt .
in Germany , according to Thr@@ illers , it has been a political turning point : from the prohibition of work for refugees to recognition of labour .
while previously a work ban on asylum seek@@ ers has been reduced by up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , just as resi@@ den@@ ers , the asylum seek@@ ers is limited to a residence .
in society , too - because of the specialist knowledge , the vision rel@@ ates that refugees should be made faster of access to the labour market .
a big hur@@ dle to access the labour market is lack of German skills .
so far there is no sufficient offer on general and occup@@ ational language courses .
research also shows that work@@ places are most often communicated by personal contact .
the Com@@ position of Networks is therefore , according to Thr@@ ut@@ hardt &apos;s views of the royal road to work information .
the Berlin school management has found that only a few fle@@ eing parents gave their children to kit@@ esur@@ f , an estimated 10 to 15 percent : &quot; for the ent@@ om@@ e@@ rooted parents , it is only very important to meet the family , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ chem@@ bar , speaker for youth and family in the Berlin Senate department .
in order to convince the family of the members of the K@@ ita , managing Hand@@ spe@@ ots in various languages .
if the demand is strongly rising by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate try to increase the capacity of training - by providing more universities .
in the countries , students without German language skills are being prepared in the classes .
however , they are not always taught by fully trained teachers and teachers , but , as in Berlin , including teachers , who have only one qualification in German as a second language .
there is no lack of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ range from Berlin &apos;s school management .
the German student union estimates that some 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany .
in principle , no Federal State asylum seek@@ ers or toler@@ ated the study - the only exception to date has been Berlin , Interior Frank Stein@@ b@@ ( CDU ) has now abandoned his post@@ ure .
a student of studies could be facil@@ itated the access to the university .
for refugees with a permit or di@@ ligen@@ ce do not receive any services following the asylum seek@@ er of asylum when they start studying .
the latter probably contains no BA@@ fÃ¶@@ G since they are not falling under the circle of suitable persons .
Ged@@ ul@@ ted Refu@@ ge@@ es had to be used in Germany for four years so far to be eligible for BA@@ fÃ¶@@ G to be warran@@ ted on January 1 , 2016 , this span is reduced to 15 months .
this funding gap must also be closed , and Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin@@ o State Secretary for Science , and the German student union .
the students should immediately get BA@@ fÃ¶@@ G .
Islam will play a more important role in future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of its identity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the state should gradually inter@@ fere in the same rights as they have the churches and the existing state @-@ churches right to a new state @-@ religions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would also be important to establish an Islamic welfare association that is professionally taking care of new arri@@ vals .
rights and obligations also belong to the rights .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact with the state and willing to work with the state in many areas and make certain control options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this also includes read@@ iness to move controls against religious fundament@@ alism .
the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , on Thursday the concern , religious conflicts could also be entered into Germany .
those who wanted to re@@ strict such conflicts in Germany would immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk .
he suggested to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
integration will in future be much more than today a theme of the whole society .
in order to change the majority of the majority , the breakdown of discrimination and rac@@ ism will also be urgent .
Germany has - as a result of European choices - from a decade of anti @-@ discrimination and a General Equality Act .
but it is very slow to learn how the NSU @-@ murder series showed , in the police and authorities ignored the rac@@ ist motive system@@ atically .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the same opportunities for all : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and those st@@ ak@@ eholders &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hunt for German already for long and why international agreements to become reality in the next few years has to become peaceful and benefit from their new citizens - for the well @-@ being of all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in general , Germany is capable of supplying the previously expected refugees medi@@ cally , the president of President Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; as far as man@@ - power and capacities , we do this , &quot; he said the Tages@@ spiegel .
however , additional money is flowing into the system .
to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery calls on all of the drives equal to the registration health card .
these services could later be charged with the federal states .
and long @-@ term it is highly question@@ able , so many people are distribut@@ ing to the restricted performance of the asylum seek@@ er .
otherwise , doctors do the physi@@ cians to create language barriers .
until now , the Berlin Department of Health , The@@ a Bor@@ de , has proven to be worse about their diseases than other patients .
not only in clinics , also in doctor &apos;s surg@@ eries had to be taken on interpre@@ ting costs , she demands .
many refugees also helped with more general medical support in the emergency ambul@@ ances as well .
and with a different diagnostic look .
under refugee camps , there are about much more untreated Dis@@ abilities , and with the young people it go to HIV @-@ recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance .
with the partial most other clinical pictures , German doctors came from their education but clearly , says Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite diar@@ rhe@@ a or tuber@@ culosis is not so difficult to identify &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; and as for the h@@ ass@@ iness , perhaps even reli@@ eving refugees in sight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syrians would have had an advanced educational system , some refugees have even doctors .
however , to be practiced , they would have to prove their quali@@ fications and try again for a while .
at least half of the refugees in Germany are mentally ill according to the bund@@ le psych@@ otherap@@ eutic drug ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most suffer from a post trau@@ matic stress disorders or depression .
Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K , are especially viol@@ able .
a recently published study by TU MÃ¼nchen shows that every fifth Syrian refugee camp is trau@@ mat@@ ised in Germany .
those who have fallen in a post trau@@ matic stress disorders , among other things , suffer from Flash@@ backs with respir@@ atory , di@@ zz@@ iness , and di@@ zz@@ iness , and death .
other symptoms are sleeping and concentration problems , pot@@ ency and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
to prevent the symptoms of chronic , early diagnosis would be chronic , Mun@@ z declared .
yet only four percent of psych@@ ically dise@@ ased refugees have received such psych@@ otherapy .
while psych@@ ic sick asylum seek@@ ers can provide a request for Psych@@ otherapy , however , editing usually takes several months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , experts or doctors , who are not trained for the mental ill@@ nesses , would decide whether a therapy is necessary or not . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this often lead to mis@@ ass@@ ess@@ ments , says Mun@@ z .

de@@ ities in the attitude of cir@@ cus animals are not too often the subject of different animal protection organisations .
Stephanie Pro@@ bst takes care of this : &quot; if we are not doing well our animals , it &apos;s also not good . &quot;
approximately 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each string unit .
the &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged arti@@ stes &quot; as they are aff@@ ection@@ ately named , is read by the eye every wish .
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal feels un@@ comfortable , it does not want to go into the ring .
so the top commandment is : good for the animals .
especially on its Zeb@@ ro@@ id jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land Pon@@ y@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a zeb@@ ra @-@ mare , the family Pro@@ bst proud .
the two animals lived together for eight years in a enclosure and nothing happened .
&quot; but then , suddenly our little Jum@@ bo is here , &quot; Brigitte Pro@@ bst explains .
while the zeb@@ ra is not ready for the ring , but this is the unique mas@@ cot of Circus Pro@@ bst .
so there might be something for every visitor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing is for sure , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stephanie Pro@@ bst , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she doesn &apos;t matter if five or 1 200 spectators , we always give our best and are with all my heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Zimbabwe Robert Mu@@ gabe today holds false speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , African leaders , fell down the stairs at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case spread rapidly throughout the social media .
the Parliament &apos;s opening was also clou@@ ded by the alle@@ g@@ ations of de@@ pu@@ ties that they had given anonymous death threats and warned them before , following Mr Mu@@ gabe by Mr Mu@@ gabe .
last month they interrupted him and interrupted him during his speech to the State of parliament in parliament - and this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man for the Movement for Democratic Change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) Inno@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven Opp@@ os@@ itions @-@ politicians have received SMS messages on their phone , which they previously warned Mr. Mu@@ cking speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not shown , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said journalists to Mu@@ es@@ man &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she warns the parliamentary members that the imm@@ unity will end in the parliament and as soon as they leave the Parliament , its parliamentary imm@@ unity was no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head spokes@@ man said by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i was &quot; worried &quot; about the dangers for the politicians .
Hewlett @-@ Packard is up to 30,000 jobs .
Hewlett @-@ Packard is expected to consoli@@ date 25,000 to 30.000 jobs within the scope of restructuring and saving efforts in the company &apos;s services .
today , HP will split up in two listed companies and split the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing company hardware and its operating activities .
the expected job loss results in a burden of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , HP said in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this restructuring measures will enable a competitive cost structure for the new Hewlett @-@ Packard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chair@@ woman and Chief Executive Officer , said : &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than it is HP today , and we have a wide and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that support companies while passing a new style of business , &quot; Whit@@ man said .
as a stand@@ alone company , we are better placed than ever to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than 50 billion annual revenue and will focus on providing un@@ att@@ ain@@ able , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; such a statement by the company .
it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 19@@ 30s by graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard , whose Palo Alto garage has been named &quot; the birth@@ place of Silicon Valley . &quot;
HP has a massive restructuring , in order to master the turn of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer , and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this area based on belief that closely focused businesses can deliver better performance .
FC Arsenal @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta say that te@@ amm@@ ates must stand before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger stressed against Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it is only September and if his rehabilitation after plan proceeds , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play before Christmas .
this optimistic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere is sure to miss at least the next four games for England and in view of its history , his participation in the next summer is certainly uncertain .
the big shame on this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate Kn@@ uck@@ le injury and then returned to his old swing during the pre@@ season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this type of injury is not threatened by the career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone , which is not good .
this is no greater matter .
this was only an accident .
it was not in connection with his an@@ kl@@ es or with the injuries which he had before .
this may be true in a medical view , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the corresponding risk of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
this also develops an un@@ comfortable pattern .
Prime Minister O@@ j@@ uries Ltd has recorded 23 different disorders of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in just 65 from Arsen@@ &apos;s &apos;s 157 b@@ anners in the last five hours .
the wider image for Arsenal is , that in six of eight play@@ times since 2007 / 08 they were one of the two Premier League clubs that reported most vulner@@ abilities .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of an inflation rate , but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the vulner@@ ability level will last during the last season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , if you come back from an injury , you have a decent period of time in which you must strengthen your body and win fighting power , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I &apos;m confident that he will do it and he will walk in a career out of the way he deserves .
arsen@@ al begins his Champions League season on Wednesday night against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur next Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger introduces himself one rotation within the team .
H@@ Ã©@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ Ã­n and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not travelling to Croatia , which means to launch Math@@ ieu Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to maintain the balance and the players who need it to gain a little off @-@ off pause , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although arsen@@ al is clear to go through group F , Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the slots with the largest in@@ ti@@ mid@@ able effect in Europe .
dynam@@ o is also un@@ defeated after 41 games , after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign started in the last season .
the stadium was rock@@ ed by an earthquake on Tuesday night , whereby it was recorded on the Richter scale 3.2 .
this year it was the 10th of Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger is the opinion that Arsenal had pulled the teaching of last season with the Champions League play @-@ capit@@ ulation against Monaco and ab@@ orted so far , driven by his management the association to his first European @-@ European triumph .
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
everything has never been out with arsen@@ al .
we were in 2006 very close to it , but on the other hand I am long enough in the shop to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ amer .
friendship Fest : the com@@ edy show , which grants us serious lessons on men &apos;s friends
the lack of similar depic@@ tions in shows is evident , particularly in regard to how the need for men to open , now even more desper@@ ate than ever has been proved to prove suicide in young men on a 15 @-@ year high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK , and three times more frequently in males than women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , the Campa@@ ign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ mining ( CA@@ LM - campaign against a mis@@ erable life ) 2015 as the year of man , with the aim of seeking culture in question , to seek assistance if they need them .
friendship is the cent@@ er@@ piece in the struggle to master this challenge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a recent study of more than 2,000 high @-@ school students with depres@@ sive symptoms revealed that if the contract had a sufficient percentage of friends with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; healthy mood &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; his chances of recovery spread . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy individuals will reduce the risks from mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends only , so that a friendship can work .
in the age of more social media , communication , with focus on substance on substance is often more important than an important contact .
our digital life have the need to be strong , powerful , and successful , even though the isolation is dominated .
this superf@@ icial achievement is dominated by what psych@@ ologists define ex@@ tr@@ ins@@ ical values ; money , image , social status , all at the cost of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner aspir@@ ation according to personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much more deep .
and how a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared , money can really not buy .
the nice thing in friends was that this focus was on its head .
each character was not defined by his work , but by his personality , which sh@@ ined by the interaction as a friend .
the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler frequent hu@@ gs , moments at the football pitch in cozy arm@@ chairs and the desire by Ross to Rachel . all this came out of the knowledge that men can refer to each case , even though they often come back to explore their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a co @-@ worker of the telephone call it told me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My list@@ ener for people who are de@@ pressed and imp@@ lied to them , really showed me how even the smallest inter@@ actions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us feel often not able to speak with friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; old Rede@@ mp@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come along with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has a tremendous impact , as the feeling that it is perceived as weakness &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that come to mind when I try to provide long @-@ term femin@@ isation mechanisms .
it clearly presents the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
so much my objective status status via phone the people in moments of despair , who likes to help people in moments of despair , long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you visit this weekend Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with the opportunity to celebrate the day completely re@@ designed scenery , why don &apos;t take your friends to drink a drink at Central Per@@ k .
or , even better if you see someone at Star@@ bu@@ cks just sitting alone , give him a smile and say hello .
you never know which difference could make your friendship .
friends is sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - the entire 236 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria hits to help PS@@ G to mal@@ ign@@ ite MalmÃ¶ .
angel Di Maria celebrates Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani according to his match against MalmÃ¶ .
di Maria met his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to pass by MalmÃ¶ .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani kept the course when Paris Saint @-@ Germain put his Champions League season with a very comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against MalmÃ¶ in the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ st@@ adion .
di Maria met with less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League de@@ but@@ ts as PS@@ G players , who climbed the French master on the way , but afterwards pushed them a number of occasions before they finally climbed up to their promin@@ ence as Cav@@ ani who scored a head ball in the 6@@ 1. minute .
with Real Madrid and S@@ acht@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k also in group A Paris requires a strong start to the Swedish Master , since they are not only asp@@ ire for the kno@@ ck@@ ups , but an improvement on the way to the four tel@@ e@@ fin@@ alists in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it was not a classic game of Laurent Blan@@ cs Team with Zlat@@ an Ibra@@ him@@ ov@@ ics adapted chances ahead of Gate . later , he was later in play against his home town team , and against the club , with whom he started his illustr@@ ating career back in 1999 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not easy to win at home or out in the Champions League . therefore , it is a good start to cause our opponents to create and rela@@ xes our opponents &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; even if there are certain things we need to perf@@ ected through the season , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Blanc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is a good sign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we have won , although I am sorry we won &apos;t have scored one or two goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ibra@@ him@@ ovic returned to his injury in one of three changes in the Paris team , which could hold a 2 : 2 un@@ decided on their own place against Bordeaux in the first league , but he was e@@ jected by Di Maria in the fourth minute .
the Argent@@ in@@ ean wing @-@ wing was called the man , who can take PS@@ G to the next step in Europe when he was taken over to the last month of Manchester United States , and he interpreted as Marco Ver@@ r@@ att@@ is pass behind the MalmÃ¶ defense before he graduated from Johan Wil@@ and in the long corner of the multilingual network .
but if someone believed that PS@@ G would win a big victory , he was disappointed .
MalmÃ¶ , the Celtic in a play @-@ off proposed to reach this stage , stood by a nine national playing field on the field and was upgraded with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field .
but except a shot by Nikola D@@ jur@@ dj@@ ic , who passed away from Kevin Tra@@ pps P@@ fo@@ sten at the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little ons@@ lau@@ ght .
instead , PS@@ G himself existed sometimes , with some mis@@ ses and bad inten@@ tions , not least by Ibra@@ him@@ ovic , which had been put up in no less than five attempts at the first half , after Cav@@ ani had put it after rest@@ art@@ ing .
nevertheless he showed a lot more skill when he put his player into play , and it was a passport of Ibra@@ him@@ -- , the Di @-@ Maria was transformed into a shooting at the 5@@ 2nd minute ...
the second gate finally fell shortly after the hours @-@ mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Uruguay Round , with it &apos;s sixth part of the season , after Ibra@@ him@@ -- had set up a left flan@@ k by Max@@ well .
this finished all the thought that MalmÃ¶ can come back into the game and only an excellent intervention of Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to David Lu@@ iz , the final score could be low , before replacement player E@@ ze@@ qu@@ iel Lav@@ e@@ zzi wrote a gate at the end .
the coach of MalmÃ¶ , Age Har@@ ei@@ de later presented that PS@@ G played a class on his team , and the Norwegian said , &quot; Our last Champions League game was in December last year .
since then , we have played only in the Swedish League , which has not the same level .
the skill games are not enough . &quot;
hat@@ s off to Paris !
it was a great game of them !

X@@ avi : P@@ EP Gu@@ ardi@@ ola prevented the change of FC Bayern in 2008
world and European champion X@@ avi have been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sports Club in Qatar for summer 2015
the FC Bayern was obviously just ahead of the commitment of Spain &apos;s Super@@ star X@@ avi , who played at the time for FC Barcelona .
eight times Spanish Master , three times final winner , four times Champions League winner , two times European champion , two times European champion , one time world champion , the title list of X@@ avi is breathtaking .
in summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona in 24 years and moved to al @-@ S@@ add Sports Club to Qatar .
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ avi reveals that he was already standing before leaving Barcelona early in 2008 .
&quot; I told me that Bar@@ Ã§a doesn &apos;t like to sell me . &quot;
&quot; Madrid then won everything we didn &apos;t know , &quot; he told .
and that also registered in FC Bayern .
X@@ avi : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted to have me . &quot;
in memory : in the summer of 2008 , JÃ¼rgen Klin@@ smann took over the FC Bayern .
Gu@@ ardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ avi was not changed
but the change did not turn off .
and the resulting man therefore works for the German record master : P@@ EP Gu@@ ardi@@ ola .
X@@ avi explains why : &quot; Bar@@ Ã§a has taken a contract for Gu@@ ardi@@ ola and I have played a great deal . &quot;
&quot; P@@ EP has told me that I would not change that he could not imagine the crew without me . &quot;
&quot; he got me around . &quot;
who knows how Bavaria joined the 2008 / 2009 season with X@@ avi .
X@@ avi stood for bar@@ ca in the quarter @-@ final of the Champions League on the lawn , the Red Sea ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the King &apos;s triumph at the end of the 18th finals .
Matt Dam@@ on playing variety in film
Matt Dam@@ on confron@@ ted the af@@ ro@@ American filmmaker Eff@@ ie Brown while a discussion on the diversity , she said she was not needed behind the scenes .
while a episode of Sunday Night of H@@ BO@@ s Project Green@@ light interrupted the experienced actor Brown , as this is the need of alternative perspectives , namely in relation to a black prot@@ agon@@ ists in the chosen scenario of the project .
&quot; if we talk about diversity , then do it in the occupation of the film and not with the occupation of the show , &quot; Dam@@ on assured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Brown re@@ acted shocked to ins@@ ist un@@ belief and called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ o ! Wow . okay &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the comments of the actors were fixed by The Mar@@ tian . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the production center Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss about the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to consider people to think about it - who will be the director ever - as they treat the figure of Harmony , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brown said first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the only black person , and she is a Nut@@ shell , who is beaten by her white acc@@ ord .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the producer of Dear White People turned out for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ acci@@ o for the direc@@ ting rights to the film ; Dam@@ on answered that their direction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end couldn &apos;t give us something we want . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the discussion was broadcast , the social media explo@@ ded over Dam@@ ons &apos;s comments .
t@@ witter users Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger over the clip by writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talking about the only black person in space , so he can explain its diversity - is SO WE@@ ISS that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
the twe@@ et earned more than 5,000 Ret@@ we@@ ets and 4.000 likes since its publication .
Dam@@ ons &apos;s comments come at a time , at the exact ra@@ cial representation in the media at the point of social discussion .
after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed by a white polic@@ eman in 2014 , the movement Black Li@@ ves became a largely absorbed and urged leg@@ is@@ lat@@ ors to enjo@@ in against any kind of law@@ ns .
in February , the singer Prince made a recording of the movement during the launch of the nominated albums of the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; album Fro@@ matter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) , he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as books and black life , albums still have their meaning .
more recently , leaders of the movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter have been published an explanation as a response to the question of Fox News personality , Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hatred group .
&quot; the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; the FÃ¼hrer said .
recently , it was announced that Dam@@ on was invited on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le , which are invited to visit the Pope to discuss the portra@@ yal of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he has accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope , is un@@ clear .

professional sport climbing and operator in Cal@@ di@@ ero was the first athl@@ ete that won the American Ninja Warrior on Monday night and took home the Grand Prize of $ 1 million .
the competition show , which completed their 7th season , had never experienced a competition atten@@ de@@ es , which could close all stages of its obst@@ acle course .
during the season , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and c@@ amer@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , until the finals .
the last job was climbing on a 75 walk long climb@@ s in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten finished the task of time with which he was the first athl@@ ete that was completed the stren@@ uous Phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero ended this challenge full three seconds faster than winner of the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! news after the hard @-@ strug@@ gling victory , still under the shock over the victory of the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean it is amazing to think about it , I have never des@@ erved more than $ 10,000 or for life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his he@@ ap . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so suddenly . as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter fo@@ ster to discuss the final and why Brit@@ ten ended when he finished the par@@ cours , not just any prize money .
according to the rules the money is the quick@@ est person .
&quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alists , the one with the fastest time , &quot; We@@ ed said .
how much money is a wonderful price and life is changing , it receives great encour@@ agement .
I don &apos;t think he &apos;s getting any res@@ ent@@ ment about it .
he is just so happy to have done what he did .
he received many awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , then I am glad there Isaac is . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Isaac would have felt the same way if they had thrown the rolls .
America Ninja Warrior has been pro@@ longed for a period of season , the shooting will begin in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers pass by Minnesota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ A@@ POL@@ IS@@ - The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
once upon a time , they were one of the top teams in bas@@ eball . today , the tiger on last place are in the American League Central .
the Tig@@ ers are reduced to her role as spo@@ iler , but played perfect on Tuesday against the Minnesota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in target Field .
the T@@ wins showed a chance for asc@@ ension within a game of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card @-@ Platz .
for Detroit , if only for one evening , there was a return of the three letters F @-@ word that had been difficult to gras@@ p over a big part of the second half of the season .
&quot; all victories make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tiger Manager Brad S@@ m .
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Alfredo Simon holding his early offensive support , as Detroit scored three times in the first two inn@@ ings , once in the sixth and then once again in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) proposed 6 times in 1 / 3 internal and made three steps possible .
it was only his third successful launch in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to finish this year strongly , &quot; said Simon .
it is hard to throw in every game in the Bull@@ pen and therefore I want to go into the game .
the designated Tiger @-@ Hit@@ ter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three @-@ day hit game by Mart@@ ine@@ z , ever since he had four hits against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on 6th July .
&quot; he said the striking f@@ tw@@ ood , &quot; said Ev@@ ism .
he looked good at the ( punch training ) , looked very much better from the bull@@ pen , and he got it right into the game .
with three R@@ uns in the back@@ side at the end of the seventh month the T@@ wins had their best chance to come into play .
Center F@@ iel@@ der Byron Bu@@ x@@ ton completed the inning with a double on the left field .
bright F@@ iel@@ ding Aaron H@@ icks reached a colorful , and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zer to kn@@ itting before he was replaced by the Left Bla@@ ine Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy over@@ ran the wall , the only man with whom he was confron@@ ted , before the designated ro@@ ok@@ ie ch@@ uck@@ mann Miguel S@@ ano , who has won a Two @-@ Run , the right @-@ handed , Dre@@ w Ver@@ dad .
with a pair of runners and the finishing run in the second , Bran@@ ch brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor pl@@ ou@@ sel to a double play .
it was the major league leader in major 27 times in this season , that pl@@ ou@@ ling hit a double play .
after Detroit added a Insurance Run event at the end of the ninth @-@ run , wall put a R@@ BI @-@ double against the loos@@ er of the tiger Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the status of 5 @-@ 4 .
the right @-@ h@@ anders however S@@ ano has three pit@@ ches for its fifth save .
Detroit benefited from the kick @-@ off of the game by an yet non @-@ moving Phil Hughes .
the tiger att@@ ained three R@@ uns in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an who had been cancelled before the game of the vulner@@ ability list after having missed more than a month because of a back @-@ suffering .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wanted me , &quot; said Hughes , &quot; but I felt better than I started and felt that I would make some pretty good pitch in the third inning . &quot;
after receiving the first ley of Le@@ ad@@ off @-@ Bat@@ ter , H@@ aber saw Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler for a single recording of Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought him into play at Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z , who made a single &quot; up the middle &quot; middle run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z made his 0 @-@ 21 success story with the runner in the sc@@ oring position .
the third bass driver Nick Castell@@ an@@ os followed by a single on the right hand side , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third exactly what the threat ended .
the tiger was on the second to take a one @-@ out Double of Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single of Center @-@ F@@ iel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose for 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; it was a big blow , &quot; T@@ wins @-@ manager Paul Mol@@ itor said .
he did not manage particularly well , but he caught the right place .
Hughes was in a Pit@@ ch @-@ Count , no points in the third inning before he was replaced by the ra@@ iling of the A.@@ J.@@ E@@ ight .
there was three hits with four hits and one walk with four stro@@ kes at Hughes .
remarks : tiger R@@ HP A@@ ni@@ bal San@@ chez was retired due to a bre@@ ach of the saus@@ age .
it is assessed by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who obtained the San@@ chez shoulder in 2007 .
San@@ chez , for mid @-@ August on the account list , because of a shoulder @-@ cut , should be activated for the start on wed@@ n@@ esday .
with San@@ chez from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Morris is stri@@ cken by the threat of injuries to start the T@@ wins .

Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military action with German involvement in Syria for an opportunity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe that the conc@@ ession on military action options cannot be held without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he threw the European states &quot; collective their position . &quot;
four years ago , it was glad that the cup has passed by military involvement in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict lies ahead of our door@@ step , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deutsch@@ land@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive rising international aid on site for refugees .
Austria controls on southern and Eastern borders
after Germany , Austria has also introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders .
the Austrian Minister of Interior Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner was on Tuesday evening on the Austrian TV channel ORF and now no one was sent back to Hungary .
in Germany , no refugees were sent to Austria .
&quot; no , this is so agreed , &quot; explained them .
on the question of an agreement that could take up a definite number of refugees from Austria every day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner , said , has already been in talks between the General Director of Public Safety and Repres@@ ent@@ atives .
concrete numbers were not calling it and promised on talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
in the past few days tens of thousands of refugees came across the United Kingdom route from Hungary to Austria .
their goal is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) and her Austrian colleague Werner Fay@@ mann at present together with several other EU leaders and government on a special summit for next week .
Germany had started on Sunday with temporary border controls on Sunday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have not so far spent on a joint venture in the crisis so far . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ministers of the EU want to take a new attempt on a binding distribution of more than 120 000 refugees on Tuesday ( 22 September ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the face of the strong refugee camp in Germany , the Federal Government wants to assist the countries with the first intake and distribution of people .
the Federal Government will manage this together with the countries announced at the end of Tuesday , at the end of Tuesday after almost four @-@ hour consultations with the minist@@ erial agencies in Berlin .
Merkel under@@ lined those people who need protection , would come to them .
but those who have no lead perspective could not stay in Germany either .
this conception was eventually divided in the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed , the state as a whole must now overcome a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; huge effort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of desper@@ ate refugees are stuck on the Balkan route .
Hungary had closed its 175 kilometers long border at Serbia in the night .
a few hours later the government in Budapest announced the border to Romania with a fence .
this neighbouring country is different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungary wanted to prevent the tu@@ g@@ boat retreat from Romania , Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the proposed new border fence .
the Romanian government convicted the plan immediately .
there was first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
in Turkey , thousands of immigrants have reported on their way to the Greek border .

at least on the South Pole , there must be an underground sea , the astronom@@ ers included then .
however , the expansion of the hidden ocean was not resolved .

&quot; that &apos;s hard to say , Rama is a her@@ etic loss . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , we have to think now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sport director Nec@@ at Ay@@ gÃ¼@@ n the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; picture &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper on the possible commitment of a united professionals . &quot; &quot; &quot;

no diet fruit - man@@ gos contain a lot of sugar
Man@@ gos are exotic and juicy .
but who wants to look out on his slim line is often not recommended by them .
because man@@ goes contain relatively much sugar - especially Sac@@ char@@ ose .
healthy are the exotic fruit however : in them B vitamins and vitamins E and C. Pri@@ p , Man@@ gos contain a lot of vitamin A and the pre @-@ stage beta car@@ otene .
those who eat the fruits , thus support ey@@ es@@ ight , immune system and met@@ abolic processes in the body .
on the purchase Man@@ gos should not be too soft or too firm and pleasant smell .
the form@@ work color alone says nothing about how ripe fruit is - so also green man@@ gos are very tasty .
store at room temperature and consume within a few days .
then they taste naturally pure or in sweet food .
a man@@ go also gives warmth and a special note .

Rome now has a Martin Luther King
almost 500 years after the Reformation there is now one Martin Luther King in Rome .
in the presence of the Mayor of San Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino , a previously famous place in the park on the Opp@@ io Hill have been christ@@ ened on the name of the German Reform@@ ator .
at the Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , he is now honoured as the &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot;
the park is located right in the old of Rome , next to the Col@@ os@@ seum .
the nam@@ ing convention was requested for the Protestant churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Rome , remember that the Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es had many centuries as a minority .
with the square become visible in a symbolic way that their tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) , a young August@@ inian mon@@ k , held up several months in Rome for the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 .
he received the city then as a commented source of sin .
his negative impressions acc@@ ru@@ ed him to view of hist@@ ori@@ ans in his later struggle against Rome .

hammer Artists invested three years into personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( g@@ ild@@ ed ) crown of Thor@@ ns is one of the main works painted by Ot@@ mar Alt for his Bible .
Klaus Al@@ te@@ post has written the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible that now appeared with splendid images .
at the beginning was the painting for Ot@@ mar Alt who form@@ ulated his personal inter@@ pret@@ ations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 mot@@ if@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colourful colours and fan@@ ciful forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - which is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary : the respective subjects may well be able to work .
for three years , Ot@@ mar Alt has worked at his bi@@ ble project for which he has made a subjective selection from the many them@@ atic areas of the &quot; book of all books . &quot;
cycles of tra@@ jec@@ tions , such as Cross , Pl@@ ages , bi@@ ds or f@@ ather@@ land are developed .
he was fascinated to several partners spont@@ ane@@ ously : this is true for the publishing house with its the@@ ological alignment , as well as the Kettler @-@ publisher with its focus on art books .
and above all , the author Klaus Al@@ te@@ post , referring to painting with the respective passages , is dealt with by Klaus Al@@ te@@ post .
it has interpreted the scriptures from Ot@@ mar Alt to the scriptures , and thus into today , into current connections . &quot;
these texts are as alli@@ ed mirror of Al@@ ts painting .
nest@@ led in between the original Bible verses of Martin Luther and one set of the artist , who form@@ ulated his very personal thought on the situation .
the jewel @-@ band has golden letters .
so the 75 @-@ year @-@ old is allowing twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
it is a high level of in@@ tim@@ acy .
emotions were ultimately a trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in W@@ ern@@ ig@@ er@@ ode in 1940 and raised in Berlin , comes from a family who belong to the strict Protestant leaders .
&quot; so the education took place with the cane , &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I tried to re@@ tire that , perhaps to bear me up with the Lord &apos;s father again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; his second concern is to aid the art in fast time again : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perception of imag@@ ery today is influenced by advertising today and that is loud . &quot; &quot; &quot;
symbol@@ ism is being pushed out there .
artists have a different lust and del@@ ights , things to show things .
images always have some secret and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect , I &apos;m a dinosau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants the viewer to look into the pictures &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; let them work , discover and feel what power they have : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture looks for his counter@@ part . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Klaus Al@@ te@@ post is now on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I like to have been a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ert &apos;s art : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I like how he gras@@ ped with his pictures &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
old , I did not consider to fully capture the Bible , but most important topics for him .
&quot; this was no collaboration at eye level , &quot; says Al@@ te@@ post : &quot; here it is about images that explained the text . &quot; this was a picture @-@ Bible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Hans M@@ Ã¶h@@ ler of Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to deep@@ en life and to find freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ert &apos;s paintings treat both the ( biblical ) language of love as well as responsibility .
part of the original - paper and canvas prints - will be presented for the first time at an exhibition that will be opened at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung on November 15th .
beginning of construction for BM@@ X
plans were set , space found , companies commissioned to mod@@ ulate earth gel for a round course : one year later , almost everything was completed - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X series was finished at the end .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fail@@ ures in politics and management provided for dr@@ ink@@ ers , especially with the residents who did not suffer the train . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so hills called up a new place - now with formal planning and application on building permission .
the approval will be written in October , the first Bishop Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck was able to tell us in children and youth affairs .
&quot; I hope this year is still visible , &quot; she said .
it should then be started without &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further commem@@ oration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the works at the former indoor pool . &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B strongly intensi@@ fied commitment to refugees
the DF@@ B increases its commitment to refugees from 2019 to 2019 , and the Bundesliga was a clear indication on the weekend .
football respon@@ ds to the ten@@ ant position in Germany and sec@@ ures the politics its help in addressing the upcoming problems .
&quot; I consider it for the biggest challenge of our country since the re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; nobody can tell in the principle that isn &apos;t doing anything , I have nothing to do with that . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must be interested in making this subject in the handle , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B boss Wolfgang Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
during the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am the next Wednesday in the chan@@ cell@@ ery and meet the State Minister Mrs. Ã@@ zo@@ Ä@@ uz and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the theme will certainly play a key role , &quot; announced it .
the football could help and wants to help .
the key turn@@ out however has to place the policy .
therefore the German Football League has therefore expanded his refugee @-@ initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; to four years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Stiftung have assured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Nier@@ s@@ bach , on the outskirts of the UEFA Meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even some LÃ¤nder support this program .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already this weekend , the 36 pro@@ fi@@ del@@ ights show a clear sign when they are carried out on the left , the usual sponsor of the sponsors ( Her@@ mes ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we want to make it clear that everyone can help , where and how they can do , &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen Sport Manager Rud@@ i Ful@@ ler of the &quot; Picture &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and illustrated the project as &quot; self @-@ understanding . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee tragedy goes every day , no one can see it away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can use soccer di@@ vin@@ ists , no , we must use our radi@@ ance , our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees who have already been incredibly lucky to help , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ offen@@ hei@@ ms Managing Director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent symbol of the League . &quot;
for the Euro 2016 quali@@ fier against Hungary on Friday the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Nier@@ s@@ bach called the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a large common work of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 license agreements have had their own projects in their own locations is great .
equally great is that small and smallest clubs are active there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we have spent is living in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; he said .
this year , the association will jointly provide 300 000 Euro for the integration of refugees together with the DF@@ B selection and the federal government .
&quot; the clubs have already called for 2015 , &quot; says Nier@@ s@@ bach .
reports : SAP @-@ Managing Director loses an eye when accident
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European CEO of Europe &apos;s largest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has rep@@ or@@ tedly lost his left eye through a fall in early July . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of an accident on the stair@@ case in his brother &apos;s house , he had fallen to a water glass after midnight , which he carried in the left hand , reports the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he &apos;s almost ble@@ ed , he was f@@ ain@@ ted out . then he took out himself out of tow@@ ed road - that &apos;s what he told us so last week , &quot; the &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; SAP @-@ co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner .
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could follow his job .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October , we meet at the Supervisory Board at Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager was on the meeting with the meeting and &quot; fully jo@@ bless . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SÃ¼d@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Thursday &apos;s Edition ) , he will return to Germany in October and continue to carry out the software group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m full for SAP , fully in my job . &quot;
&quot; of course I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and his chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t said . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t normally comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go to the public with such a personal history , the manager of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everybody can do anything like that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is important to get up again when you &apos;ve fallen . &quot;

football : Bv@@ B without R@@ EU@@ s against Kras@@ no@@ dar : female gate in the gate
at Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund , all hopes for a com@@ eback issued by Marco R@@ EU@@ s will finally break down in the Europe league in the first group of the Europa League .
the national player will also be missing to the championship leader of the soccer league in du@@ el with the FB Tanz@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19.00 / Sky ) .
&quot; unfortunately we can &apos;t call him , &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel , Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether R@@ EU@@ s will be back in the Bundesliga in the Bundesliga match against Le@@ verk@@ usen : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the Bv@@ E @-@ Coach : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the high loading of its professionals , Tu@@ chel does not only change his tri@@ bal in the R@@ EU@@ s position .
so he announced a change on the door@@ step .
that is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller accepts the place of master crafts@@ man Roman Br@@ ki .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he trained on an absolute top level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; engaged the soccer teacher to the World Champion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , if Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the future is used in all Europa League games , Tu@@ fen@@ nel left open .
with the high probability , he is also competing with the second game .
the for@@ ce@@ ful statement of def@@ ender R@@ EU@@ s that the final report for the Bv@@ E in the Europa League will be final , keeping mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian Wei@@ gl for a while : &quot; this means that Marco is not so wrong . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to access the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rob@@ ber@@ cars : government wants to lead a role model for Germany
according to the will of the federal government , Germany should be the driving of the car technical pioneer .
the Bundes@@ kab@@ in@@ ett decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which can be seen in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Frankfurt on Wednesday , Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke at the br@@ ink of the IAA Automobile Show a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new mobile age &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the automated and connected driving will increase traffic safety and take care of less st@@ aves , Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t said .
he also plans to discuss the issue with his counter@@ parts from the G7 states , who also come together with representatives from the International Motor Show .
the strategy of strategy of the traffic ministry is st@@ resses the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and excellent migration into digital radio .
the test track for testing new technology is currently on motorway 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the driver &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks become br@@ ushed &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Federal Government will review the legal framework &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and , if necessary , adapt to new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Germany is trying to use it internationally that the permitted maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars is increased from 10 to 130 kilometers per hour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the federal government plans to establish a change in the Vienna Convention which only sees people as a driver so far . &quot; &quot; &quot;
during automated driving the car takes over the lead , driver will become more and more passenger .
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study conducted by the Economic Ministry of Economic Affairs , highly automated driving on high@@ ways by 2020 is technically possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but still dri@@ ver@@ less vehicles on public roads are expected to expect &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far to 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the authors of the study on site in Germany will estimate the value of value of driver assistance systems and the highly @-@ automated driving functions in Germany to around 8.4 billion euros by 2025 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of the car can lead to more safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said SPD transport critic S@@ Ã¶ren Bart@@ ol . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the issue of liability in accidents and the safety of the personal data of the drivers clearly must be clari@@ fied .
but the Germans are still scep@@ tical about the Germans - much more than French or Americans .
a survey conducted on Wednesday at the AA institute on behalf of the Committee DE@@ K@@ RA arrives at the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars in the next ten years have to prevail , 32 percent count in 20 years thus , 31 percent believe not at all .
in France , 21 percent of those survey@@ ed were reck@@ oned by 2025 with autonomous driving cars , 33 per cent by 2025 .
anyway , the drivers in Germany are not ready to leave himself completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
following a survey of the Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to be able to shut up control throughout the entire drive on all roads .
on the free@@ way , the traffic could still imagine 15 percent in the flowing traffic , in turn 45 per cent .
good every fourth would leave the car under no circumstances .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough to bring the title , even without Timo , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bundest@@ ra@@ iner JÃ¶rg Ro@@ Ã@@ head during the course in DÃ¼sseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Gaul@@ tier feels too old for a enf@@ ant .
it is a mixture of quite big fashion show and a wax @-@ figures hor@@ us@@ el@@ kab@@ in@@ ett : the designer Jean Paul Gaul@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on his work on Wednesday in Munich .
highlights : display man@@ ne@@ qu@@ ins , which appear very human thanks to video projec@@ tions .
they carry the spectacular creations of the French designer , including Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits , to the great star of the fashion scene - and that he put men in skirts .
&quot; I can no longer say that I &apos;m the enf@@ ant of Haute Cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier it was ble@@ ached , now it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gaul@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) that is to be seen from 18 September in the Kunsth@@ alle the Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , his initially deduc@@ ting post@@ ure at a show about his person has changed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; actually he was about it , because : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , an exhibition sounded a little bit of death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you die , you come into the museum .
the impressive collection had previously been set in the Canadian Montreal and Paris station .
&quot; it &apos;s so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger D@@ ieder@@ en .
it &apos;s about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the hardly over@@ looking work of man , whose fashion is written without ever having completed a training .
the show is chron@@ ologically , the show is not built , but it is a great chore@@ ograph@@ ed work piece that was used for a lot of effort : to keep the dolls , for instance , a styl@@ ist has been specially engaged .
14 tons of material have sc@@ ared the cre@@ ators after the cour@@ ageous by Thierry Meyssan , Thierry is L@@ ori@@ ot .
shortly before the Okto@@ ber@@ fest there was another special Sch@@ man@@ ker@@ l : a leather h@@ osen outfit with a cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is always interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a little different , said Gaul@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also Gaul@@ ti@@ ers old Teddy is seen in the exhibition .
it stands for the first , ag@@ ony @-@ fashi@@ onable testing of the designer .
as a kid ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he put on his te@@ ddy B@@ HS and clothes , said Gaul@@ tier .
playing with a doll would not have allowed his parents to either .
the design of fashion he taught himself later .
he st@@ ole the fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designer , as Gaul@@ tier was told in Munich .
of course I bought these things later .
for his first fashion show he cannot pay the models .
they didn &apos;t get anything , they could keep the clothes .
jewelry instead of Gar@@ dine - Pl@@ au@@ ener Sp@@ itz as fashion niche
in the past , it went to long stit@@ ching machines in and around Pl@@ auen .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and tips were created in great quantity for customers who , for example , processed ceilings and she@@ ers .
today , it does not work anymore , Andreas Rein@@ hardt explains , managing director of the Mo@@ e@@ quest@@ s Pl@@ auen .
instead the fashion is important again .
in the early hours of pl@@ au@@ stri@@ a fashion , fashion has played a greater role , was then driven by the home textiles industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt sum@@ s some examples : top in jewelry , accessories such as bags and regional costumes .
at even the so @-@ called Vintage fashion , bor@@ rowed from past sty@@ list@@ ic periods , an increasing delivery capacity .
those who are not used in the textile industry in Germany is no longer available on the market .
with us , they already make half of all orders .
Mo@@ e@@ quest@@ s Pl@@ auen is a member of the industry association of pl@@ ums and mar@@ cker@@ ies together with nine other companies .
only they may carry the protected label .
in the last 15 years , about 80 percent of the turnover is broken .
private shops and wholesale there are almost no more .
our products are hardly able to reach the customer on this path .
nowadays , mass ware are produced much cheaper in Asian region and almost exclusively sold over chains .
also , we@@ aken the export , currently to Russia and the United States .
so there are sufficient reasons for new ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the industry association is also trying to score points , such as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer from the embroi@@ der@@ y market in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year we have a quality seal , which shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially toler@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; that also refers to the materials used . &quot;
U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schnee@@ berger outdoor law of the West @-@ Sax@@ onian University of Z@@ wick@@ au - in the fac@@ ulty for applied art - and speci@@ alis@@ es on st@@ ickers and tips .
in order to oppos@@ e the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
this takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is a voltage field between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and enterprises that need to think most of all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is why an existing design is often only slightly varied to keep a customer base .
a few years ago , the textile designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter newly restored the historic sn@@ ails .
this turns the machine to some spots small cu@@ ffs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the pl@@ otter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bulgarian Gold Medal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had inspired me : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before I couldn &apos;t do anything with a traditional pl@@ unge rain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she uses the sn@@ ail tip for her jewelry .
in an elabor@@ ate process , it shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; many people of the region identify with the theme of pl@@ um - young and old , &quot; says Re@@ uter .
it also supplies the USA , Australia and Finland - especially to customers who have lived in Pl@@ auen and the environment and would like to have a memory of memory .
this means I see my jewelry as a modern ambassador for pl@@ otter .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; film
so don &apos;t touch le@@ gends , but Disney still dar@@ es to play a new movie of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but , according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Entertainment Weekly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , it &apos;s not about a curiosity , but a kind of continuation , which takes 20 years after the first movie with the magic child girl . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are about the experiences of N@@ anny with the family B@@ anks in times of world economic crisis in England .
whoever plays p@@ opp@@ ins for more than 50 years after Julie Andre@@ ws is still un@@ clear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the director is already clear : Rob Marshall , recently with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the cinema . &quot; &quot; &quot;
XI p@@ ushes to open the economy wider to the world
the economy has to be wider directly to the outside to promote growth , said President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping said on Tuesday a group to assist with the donation of the reform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should make sure to attract foreign investment and know @-@ how and improve the strategies for business start , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an approach at the 16th session of the central leadership Group for deep@@ ening a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to promote new foundations and promote reforms , new momentum and vitality can bring vitality and new place for economic growth , said X@@ i .
the management group has adopted a number of guidelines , including a negative , to regul@@ ate market access , Rel@@ ax@@ ing to the border controls , promoting the state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ h@@ aul of the population @-@ Mel@@ des@@ System .
after the statement , a neg@@ ativity list is created , the sectors and companies that are not question@@ ed for investment .
the system is tested and tested according to test programmes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initiative is of importance since it claims to the market a greater role in the ingredient of resources , warran@@ ted and open the market open , said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will also lo@@ osen the powers on the powers deleg@@ ated to the company and ensure companies will decide how to manage their business . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the statement also said that China &apos;s border areas allow new models of border @-@ border operations and new mechanisms to promote regional growth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as part of an offer , state @-@ controlled sectors , additional areas will be opened to private investment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legitim@@ ate interests of foreign finance and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , it is easier to apply for foreigners , a permanent residence or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Green Card &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by optimi@@ zing the requirements and facil@@ itates the application process . &quot; &quot; &quot;

EU wants to double the level of mercury in prey
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large volume @-@ fish and the consumers make a significantly higher dose of ner@@ ves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ ood@@ watch Group &apos;s consumer organization , which is a corresponding partner in the EU , critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; risks and side effects failed by industry and environmental policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt from F@@ ood@@ watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , telling the limits of nerve tox@@ icity for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ k or s@@ word@@ fish from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; economic reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish is increased . &quot; &quot; &quot;
large pre@@ dat@@ ors are already so strongly poll@@ uted with mercury so that at the still applicable limit values , around 50 per cent of the length can not be sold .
after dou@@ bling of the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be irre@@ vo@@ cable .
in turn , the EU , according to F@@ ood@@ watch , aims to raise the limit values for other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams per kil@@ ogram .
however , F@@ ood@@ watch shows this as &quot; trick &quot; because smaller gra@@ d@@ fish , such as car@@ p , are mostly used as low as they already have the maximum limit values already today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the sender of Kl@@ einf@@ isch should be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a statement of stra@@ pping man@@ oeu@@ v@@ res in the economy alone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a toxic heavy metal which en@@ han@@ ces the food chain particularly in the food chain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the federal government therefore warns that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already small amounts of damage to the nervous system can &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Ministry of Environment proclaimed on its homepage with regard to the current maximum values , however , that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health threat to the general population &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is mainly driven by coal combustion into the environment .
according to a written report by the Federal Ministry of Environment , Ann@@ al@@ ena Ba@@ er@@ be@@ et ordered more than six tonnes of mercury in the German Bundestag for more than six tons of mercury in total , two thirds of the total @-@ generated total .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mercury in fish such as El@@ be , Rhine and Danube is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; long @-@ lasting and nationwide &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had been cited in March from the paper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , Europe @-@ wide war@@ nings reported for mercury in fish resulted in the most common health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
