the measures provided in this agreement will be carried out so that they are not a disability for the economic and technological development in the community or for international cooperation in the area of peaceful nuclear activities , including the international exchange of core material ;
B ) no imp@@ ass@@ able procedure in the peaceful nuclear activities in the community , in particular in the operation of the plants ;
C ) with the che@@ et@@ ches of a careful operation in line as they are required for economic and reliable execution of nuclear activities .
( a ) The organization meets all arrangements , to protect business and industrial intelligence , as well as other confi@@ dential information , from which they have gained knowledge in carrying this agreement .
II ) Identi@@ fied information on nuclear material , the safety measures according to this Convention , may be published on the Council of the Council and with the consent of the directly affected countries or the community as far as each of the two parties concerned is published .
( a ) On the implementation of securing measures in accordance with this Convention , the technological development will be fully charged , and all efforts are made to ensure the optimum cost effective and the application of a real @-@ effective safety monitoring system , which is due to the use of instruments and other technical proceedings at certain strategic points , as far as the current or future technology possible .
B ) To ensure optimum cost effectiveness , for example , the following procedure is applied : I ) spatial fingers as a means to defin@@ ing the material image zones for the booking purposes ;
III ) Con@@ centr@@ ation of testing procedures on the phases of the fuel cycle , which could be produced without further nuclear weapons and other nuclear weapons , provided that this does not hin@@ der the implementation of this agreement .
( a ) For the effective implementation of the securing measures in accordance with this Convention , the Community provides information on nuclear material , the safety measures , and on the characteristics of the facilities which are in relation to this material from Bel@@ ang .
( B ) i ) The organization requires only the minimum level of information and data that is compatible with the implementation of their tasks .

each state applies to the organisation , including assets , funds and assets , as well as their inspec@@ tors and other officials , the corresponding provisions of the agreement on the privileg@@ es and deliver@@ ances of the International Atom@@ ic Energy Organisation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the safety measures according to this agreement will end in relation to core material , when the community and organisation determine that the material has been consum@@ able or diluted in a way that is less usable or virtually non @-@ re@@ usable under the view@@ point of the safety measures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Community , according to the organization of this agreement , is subject to the disclos@@ ure of nuclear material from the States , which is subject to the securing measures according to the Convention .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the safety measures according to this agreement will be termin@@ ated in relation to core material , as soon as the recipient is provided , as in this Convention , the responsibility was taken over . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the organization leads documents , from which any disclos@@ ure and , if necessary , the re@@ application of the backup will indicate the further core material .
should core material , the securing measures according to this Convention , are used in non @-@ nuclear activities , such as the production of allo@@ ys or ceramics , so agreed with the organization of such a material , under which circumstances the securing measures will be termin@@ ated in terms of this agreement in relation to this material .

in regulation , as long as possible , how long and under which circumstances , these safety measures will not be applied .
in any case , the appropriate safety measures will be applied in this agreement as soon as the core material is added to a peaceful nuclear activity .
the organisation will be informed of the material and composition of this material in the relevant state or the concerned of such material from this state or of these states .
this explains how quickly their consent as quickly as possible ; but it covers only on matters such as temporary and inter@@ pret@@ ations for coverage , but does not include a endor@@ sement or a secret knowledge of military activity and does not refer to the following use of the kernel material .
the organization , the community and the States bear the costs that each of them grow out of their respective obligations in accordance with their respective obligations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the community , the states or persons who are subject to its test@@ ament , are subject to an extraordinary cost as a result of a special investig@@ ator of the organisation , so the organisation will reimbur@@ se these costs , if it pre@@ destined to be prepared in advance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in any case the organization carries the costs of any additional measurements and samples , which are required by inspec@@ tors of the organisation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Community and the States ensure that the liability for nuclear damages , including insurance or other financial security , may be claimed to be eligible for the organisation and its officials for the purpose of carrying this agreement in the same way application as on the nationals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
any claim to which the community or the organization oppos@@ e the association or the organisation of the association or the organization for damages - with the exception of damages from a nuclear dispute - which is due to the implementation of the securing measures in accordance with this Convention , is defined in line with international law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council for Ex@@ am@@ ination &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; provides information provided by the general manager , that the organization has not been constra@@ ined by pro@@ spect , for nuclear weapons or other nuclear spr@@ inkl@@ es , so he can report the reports issued in Article X@@ II clau@@ se C of the Stat@@ utes and , if necessary , also take action on other measures there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with these steps the Council takes into account in which mass was achieved by the applied safety measures , and the community or the state - as far as each of the two parties concerned is concerned - any representative opportunity to ensure the council &apos;s necessary safety . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on request of the organization , the community or state will take place consultations on issues relating to the interpretation or application of this agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Community and the States are entitled to seek that issues relating to the interpretation or application of this agreement will be assessed by the Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the Community and the States design@@ ate two arbit@@ rators , the organisation names also two arbit@@ rators , and the four refer@@ ee refer@@ ee choose a fifth , ch@@ aired by the ch@@ aired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have the Community and the United States or the organization within three days following the request for an arbit@@ ration , nor two arbit@@ rators , so the community or organization can nom@@ inate the president of the International Court of Justice to ap@@ point these arbit@@ rators . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same procedure is to apply if within three days after the name or appointment of the fourth refer@@ ee of the fifth arbit@@ rator is not yet chosen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a majority of the members of the arbit@@ ral tribunal shall be compl@@ ain@@ able , and all decisions require the consent of at least three arbit@@ rators . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decisions of the arbit@@ ral tribunal shall be binding for the organisation , the Community and the concerned States .

the purpose of this part of the agreement is to specify the procedure of the provisions relating to the provisions of the Te@@ ils I through securing measures .
the aim of the safegu@@ arding method specified in this Convention is the timely discovery of a significant quantities of nuclear nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear weapons and deter@@ rent by such a branch due to the risk of premature discovery .
for en@@ rich@@ ment of the target , the material accounting is used as a backup of basic importance , alli@@ ed with spatial input and observation as important supple@@ mentary measures .
the technical exp@@ ul@@ sion of tests by the organization takes place by a declaration in which for each material balance zone , which is specified for a particular period not to be specified for specif@@ ying accuracy limits for the given levels .
during the implementation of their checks , the organization takes care of the community after article 3 full use of the community .
the accounting and control system of the community for core material according to this agreement is based on a breakdown in material image zones .
when using their safety measures , the community of de procedures and measures will make use of the following kind of use , and if necessary , see how it is determined in supple@@ mentary agreements .
a ) a measurement system for the removal of quantities of preserved , restored , lost , lost , lost or in other manner derived from the stock of the core material and the stocks ;
B ) evalu@@ ating the reprodu@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and estim@@ ation of measurement un@@ certainty ;
C ) method of determination , testing and valu@@ ation of differences in the measurements of sender and recipient ;
e ) method to assess any rate of stocks not measured and un@@ measured losses ;
F ) a protocol and reporting system , which points to each material image zone , the core material continu@@ ance and changes of the material including the one - and outputs of the material image zone ;
g ) Re@@ vers@@ al , ensure that the accounting procedures and agreements must be performed correctly ;
h ) Proce@@ dures to refund from reports to the organization in accordance with articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the safety measures in accordance with this agreement does not extend to material in mining or in the arch@@ processing preparation .
B ) Is an Ur@@ an - or th@@ ori@@ um@@ ous material that has not yet reached the phase of the nuclear cycle circul@@ ates , in the states , the fellowship of the organization shares the amount and composition of the material , unless it is not used for specific non @-@ nuclear purposes ;
C ) relies on nuclear material , which is manufactured according to composition and purity for the fuel production , or the process phase , in which it is produced , or will implement this material or other , in a later stage of the nuclear cycle circul@@ ating , it is subject to other securing measures in this agreement .
a ) The safety measures provided in this agreement will not be termin@@ ated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 11 . however , the community is subject to the re@@ generation of nuclear material , the securing measures for this agreement is not possible or desired , thus consult the organization and fellowship above the application of suitable securing measures .
B ) The safety measures provided in this agreement will be termin@@ ated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 13 , unless the organization and community determine that this material is virtually non @-@ profit .
on request of the community , the organization has freed the following core material from the securing measures following this agreement :
a ) special sp@@ inal material when it is used in grams - or smaller amounts as sensor in instruments ;
B ) the core material if it is used in non @-@ nuclear activities according to Article 13 , if such a material is rec@@ la@@ able , and
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ onium with an is@@ ot@@ open@@ er of Pl@@ ut@@ onium @-@ 238 , which lies over 80 % .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on request of the community fre@@ es the organization &apos;s core material , the otherwise securing measures would be subject to this agreement , if the whole , due to this article in the States delivered free core material to no time more than
a ) Total p@@ alt@@ able material that can consist of one or more of the following materials :
II ) Ur@@ an with an accumulation of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calcul@@ ates by multip@@ lication of its weight with the en@@ rich@@ ment ,
III ) Ur@@ an with an en@@ rich@@ ment that is less than 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above natural ur@@ anium calcul@@ ates by multip@@ lication of its weight with the fifth square of the accumulation ;
B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ anium and enriched ur@@ anium with an accumulation of more than 0.0@@ 05 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) twenty metric tons of total storage with an en@@ rich@@ ment of 0.0@@ 05 ( 0.5 % ) or less ;
in particular , liberated core material along with core material , which is subject to the securing measures according to this Convention , are processed or stored , so will proceed for the re@@ application of securing measures on that material .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Community meets supple@@ mentary agreements with the organization dedicated to the successful and effective proceeds of the tasks of the organisation according to this Convention , as defined in the procedures set specified in the Convention . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the supple@@ mentary agreements may be extended or modified without changing the agreement between the organization and community .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the supple@@ mentary agreements occur at the same time with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention into force . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the organization , the Community and the United States are able to enter into force within nin@@ ety days following the entry into force of this agreement between the organization , the community and the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the organization is based on the basis of the initial inventory of the entire , the securing measures of this Convention on Nuclear Energy in the States , regardless of its origin , based on the following reports and results of their review . &quot; &quot; &quot;
between the European Economic Community ( EEC ) and its Member States , Belgium , Denmark , the Federal Republic of Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , the Netherlands , the United Kingdom ( Member States ) and the International Development Organisation ( Organisation )
in ER@@ WA@@ Y AP@@ ART@@ MENT - a ) The EEC decided to contribute to the Special Economic Cooperation Conference on the Conference for International Economic Cooperation with low income , which is ob@@ struc@@ ted by general resource cent@@ ri@@ fer@@ ing problems .
C ) It is the goal of the EEC and the Member States that the whole of the Member States is bound within six months after entry into force of the agreement and as far as possible , within two years after entry into force , the organization will do its potential to achieve this goal .
( D ) The EEC and the organization have cons@@ ulted each other about the proposed execution and management of this agreement and the central bind@@ ings to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the scope of this agreement .
to this end , the organization of the EEC has presented a table , in which way it is purpos@@ ed to apply the criteria specified in this Agreement -
&quot; &quot; &quot; the organization is aimed at a special account under the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Special editorial account &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which is managed by the Organization in accordance with this agreement , which is referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Administrator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in this property , the organisation will be defined as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Administrator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in accordance with the provisions set specified in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the shareholders account will be separated and separated from any other accounts and activ@@ ites of the organization .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the contributions are as follows : a ) The payment is made in the form of cash or irre@@ voc@@ ably deb@@ tors of the member state , to pay in order to pay in the currency of the organisation as an administrator of the association as an administrator of the organisation and in the legal place of the organisation in the country concerned . &quot; &quot; &quot;
B ) Payment is made in two install@@ ments , ( i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the post within 30 days of entry into force of this agreement or to another between the EEC and the ste@@ ward date ;
II ) the second in the amount of the contributions to 1 January 1979 or at another time , between the EEC and the Administrator , taking into account the dead@@ lines required for parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans .
( C ) Every member state can afford payments before the above @-@ mentioned dates .
the ste@@ ward takes place in accordance with the usual procedure of the organization about proportional drawing to cash or school credits , in order to cover the expenses for the special expenses and to compens@@ ate the special editorial account in a reasonable manner .
under the warranty of these loans , the car@@ et@@ akers can lead to the conditions of the EEC by following factors :
III ) the scope in which international economic factors have contributed to the current and predic@@ table economic problems of the country ;
VI ) the composition and the trend of debt service in the country and its additional credit to loan agreement without compensation ; and
VII ) the scope in which the problems of the respective countries must be regulated by contributions from other sources .
each special note loan serves to finance a clear and rapidly @-@ pay@@ ed development program ( including a sec@@ toral commission ) , which is ir@@ respective of the procedure and practices , which is considered to be considered as a loan of the organisation , which is considered to be considered as the objective of the organisation under the letter b ) of the pre@@ am@@ ble to this agreement .
the funds provided by the International Bank for reconstruction and development ( bank ) or the organisation may not be tied to a program or project , which has already been approved by the Bank or Organization on the day of entry into force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apart from section 4 , special charges are subject to the same withdrawal terms which are generally considered by the organization ; they are therefore payable in ten free years , in 50 years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
special loans are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are refundable in these currencies .
amounts to pay for these are directly to the organization that re@@ tains it .
each special loan agreement is provided by a separate loan agreement between the recipient and the administrator , in particular the source of funds .
the revenue from each special offer loan can be used in the currency of the recipient or for goods or services ( i ) in developing countries , which are established in a member state ; ii ) in developing countries , which have been established in accordance with the management as the administrator at the time of loan loss .
capital spending of special loans , and the amount paid in this way in the currency of a Member State will return to the member state as soon as possible by the administrator to the respective member state .
the car@@ et@@ akers teaches the EEC as full of all Special Offer Con@@ trac@@ tions to the EEC and the directors approved by the directors approved by directors approved by directors and programmes .
during the period of withdrawal of special loans , the ste@@ wards advis@@ es the EEC four times a year on the development of the special loans and the expenses .
the ste@@ ward transfers the EEC as soon as possible after the exp@@ ending of the financial year , an extensive accounting accounts with an opinion of the external audit@@ or &apos;s external audit@@ or .
after full payment of the shareholders , the Administrator is transmitted as soon as possible a detailed report on the projects financed by the Special shareholders account .
the car@@ et@@ aker creates and exec@@ utes adequate records and billing , from which contributions to the Special shareholders &apos; account , which are linked to the account number and funds paid in the account and the withdraw@@ als to the member states are evident .
the EEC and the car@@ et@@ akers work closely together to achieve the aims of this agreement .
to this end , the EEC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the cust@@ odi@@ an up to the full issue of the Special editorial accounts , the progress of the Special Action accounts , the progress of the Special Action accounts , financed by special actions , financed by special actions , related to the provisions of this agreement .
if this agreement is on 31 December 1978 , or at a later date , the EEC and the organization , if necessary , have not entered into force , the agreement and all obligations ar@@ ising from it with immediate effect .
is the total capital amount paid by the recipi@@ ents in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this Agreement and transferred to the Member States , this agreement and all the obligations of the parties shall be termin@@ ated with immediate effect .
this agreement requires author@@ ization by the individual Member States and the EEC as a basis for the legal provisions of each party .
governments of the Member States verify the exp@@ ending of the proceedings concerned by the Council of the European Communities .
the Secret@@ ariat general direc@@ ts these not@@ if@@ ications with the not@@ if@@ ications of this agreement by the EEC to the organization .
this agreement is effective and enters into force on the first day of the month , which follows the day of the given note in the organization .
this agreement is made in two documents in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch , whereby each word is binding to the same .
considering that the agreement in the form of a letter changed to the amend@@ ment of the Annex A of the Protocol ( 1 ) to the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) :
between the European nuclear association and the Swiss Con@@ federation in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma glucose
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EURO@@ PE@@ AN Atom@@ ic Foundation , herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Eur@@ atom &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; represented by the Commission of the European Communities , listed below , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Commission &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and THE Swiss Con@@ federation , herein@@ after called &quot; Switzerland , &quot; represented by the Swiss Federal Council , herein@@ after called &quot; Bundes@@ rat , &quot;
this program includes the creation of a large research facility , the J@@ ET project ( Joint European Tor@@ us ) , whose construction and operation are named after chapter V of the Eur@@ atom Treaty - herein@@ after called &quot; Common Fir@@ m J@@ ET &quot; - listed below .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Switzerland has been concentr@@ ating on research in the field of controlled core fusion and Plas@@ map@@ hy@@ si@@ k for several years and is perfectly familiar with the area concerned . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as far as to practical use of controlled nuclear devices , it is in interest to avoid unnecessary efforts to avoid unnecessary inter@@ actions and to gain their respective research , which have gained a higher priority level due to the energy crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this agreement is to prevent any contrac@@ ting party in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and the Plas@@ map@@ hy@@ si@@ k research efforts to avoid unnecessary inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ aries and accordingly the common objective of this research work , i.e. the cost @-@ conduc@@ tive electrical power generation by using the controlled core fusion reaction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; to submit the objective of the present agreement the parties involved in App@@ endi@@ x I and II of this agreement defined research programmes , listed below &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Eur@@ atom program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Swiss program &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to ensure effective cooperation , the Swiss program takes over long @-@ term goals and the forms of collaboration of the Eur@@ atom program ; it is extended or modified by Article 5 to 10 and Article 16 of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Agreement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Article 5 to 10 and Article 16 of the corresponding agreement which includes new activities that are relevant for the Eur@@ atom program . &quot; &quot; &quot;
every time , if the contract parties accept a new program , this is where the programs listed in App@@ endi@@ x I and II are listed on this agreement .
the Association approved in paragraph 1 is realized by : - appropriate participation in each of the contract parties throughout the preparation and execution of the other party programs ;
- Exchange of staff under the respective laboratories in the Eur@@ atom Member States , in Switzerland and the third countries , with whom Eur@@ atom has signed a similar agreement as the present @-@ party agreement , listed below &quot; Associate Member States , &quot; as well as the Labor@@ atories based on the Eur@@ atom program ;
- reci@@ pro@@ cal right of access to the scientific and technical results of the respective programs .
in the context of the present agreement , Switzerland particip@@ ates at the J@@ ET project .
in terms of carrying out in Article 2 digit 1 of this agreement intended to conclude an association agreement , herein@@ after called &quot; Association Agreement , &quot; which is as far as possible to that between the Commission and the States and companies or people , listed below &quot; Associ@@ ated organs , &quot; under the realisation of the Eur@@ atom program .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the same objective , Eur@@ atom is worried that Switzerland is involved with the timing of the present agreement on the agreement between the Commission and the associated organs , which is called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; agreements on personnel exchange &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with regard to the participation in the J@@ ET project , Switzerland is part of the Executive Board of the Joint Company J@@ ET , whose Stat@@ utes are accepted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , Eur@@ atom is worried that Switzerland may be contrac@@ ted to contract any contract with its aim in the context of the present agreement , except associations or other similar contracts concluded by Eur@@ atom during the date of the present agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the organs , intended to carry out the association provided in Article 2 of 1 of the present agreement , are described in Article 5 to 10 of this agreement and the association agreement .
the association agreement , in particular , must belong to the implementation of a steering committee , the responsible representative of the Commission and the Federal Council .
- to monitor the research of research and to direct the results achieved in line with the goals of this agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Switzerland will be represented by a maximum of two deleg@@ ates in the connection group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ G &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the Eur@@ atom program - represented by the maximum of two deleg@@ ates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the V@@ G , which intends to ensure information exchange and cooperation in all questions concerning the current or scheduled programmes and activities in the field of the Eur@@ atom program , this task is true regarding all research and development activities that rel@@ ates to this agreement .
it promotes cooperation and coordination between the associated organs and organis@@ ing their T * activity in the interest of the two contract parties in the Eur@@ atom program and in the Swiss program as well as in Article 1 of the present agreement , whereby the scientific and technological developments in the world are taken into account .
according to their Rules of Proc@@ edure , V@@ G names one or more of the Swiss representatives being trained by the Eur@@ atom program , whenever the relevant Swiss authorities are searching for .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the consulting groups , which grants the funding for the Eur@@ atom Programme approved the best possible scientific results for the Eur@@ atom program , take this task regarding all research and development work true to which deal with regard to this agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the context of the Eur@@ atom program , the directors are represented by the director of a participating laboratories .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the directors of directors to monitor the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program , and that is responsible for the work carried out in the framework of the program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Working Group &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which are involved in the scope of the program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; work &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is responsible for all research and development projects that fall under the present agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he provides particular for the best use of staff and for exchange of the same between the laboratories which are involved in the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program and the Swiss program .
a Swiss representative is entitled to participate in the sessions of all coordin@@ ating commit@@ tees involved in the Eur@@ atom programme .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the coordin@@ ating commit@@ tees that have suitable proposals for themselves on the respective area are subject to the possible use of the means of staff , personnel , knowledge and skills , which are working on the respective area concerning all research and development work that fall under the present agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the BA@@ F belongs to the core and energy research responsible for every member state of Eur@@ atom , Switzerland , and every associated third parties .
on request of the Commission advis@@ es the Commission with regard to the implementation of the program and the et@@ w@@ ai@@ ds changes in the exec@@ utions and the preparation of their total amount , coordination , and integration of national activities in the field of merger .

already now , however , some conditions are called , for their application the BI@@ Z would be ready .
at each stand@@ by @-@ credit , the BI@@ Z would initially assume a commitment for two years , with the possibility of extensions accepted , but without a total of five years .
in the opening of the loans as well as with their respective extension , the B@@ IS would calculate a credit @-@ opening commission .

anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) Serum ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells that contain ag@@ glut@@ in@@ u@@ genic A and / or B , i.e. those of group A including the sub@@ groups of A@@ 1@@ B and A@@ 2B , which contain no human red blood cells , which contain no ag@@ glut@@ in@@ u@@ genic A or B , i.e. those of group 0 .
it ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells that contain A@@ x ( A@@ y or A@@ o ) an@@ tigen ( which are not ag@@ glut@@ inated by blood cells of the group B ) .
an anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) Serum is parallel to the re@@ dissolved , but un@@ diluted International standard definition of anti @-@ A blood group or corresponding equivalent of up to A1 and A2 blood cells .
furthermore , it is parallel to the re@@ dissolved , but un@@ diluted International standard prepar@@ atory of anti @-@ B blood group or a corresponding equivalent of B @-@ blood cells .
the effectiveness of the ser@@ um may not amount to less than 64 international units per ml .
un@@ diluted anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) blood ser@@ um must also cause a easily identi@@ fi@@ able ag@@ glut@@ ination of the blood cells of the group A@@ x ( A@@ y or A@@ o ) .
if an anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) ser@@ um is shu@@ ff@@ led with same volume of 5@@ - to 10@@ percent in@@ flows of A1 and A2 blood cells , this must be re@@ dissolved when the same attempts are re@@ dissolved , but un@@ diluted International standard definition of anti @-@ A blood group or with a standard definition of equal activity .
anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) ser@@ um acts with a same amount of 5@@ - to 10@@ percent up@@ lifting of B @-@ blood cells , which is required if the same attempt to re@@ dissolved , but un@@ diluted International standard preparations of the anti @-@ B blood group or a standard supplement of equal applications .
if an anti @-@ A + an anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) ser@@ um is mixed on an object carrier with the same amount of a 5@@ - to 10@@ percent of blood cells , the ag@@ glut@@ ination has to occur within 5 minutes at a temperature of 18 to 25 ° C .
anti @-@ R@@ h blood group sera every specif@@ icity can be part of one of two species which distinguish themselves through the conditions of which an ag@@ glut@@ ination is hom@@ olog@@ ous blood cells .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with others who are called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in@@ complet@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; an ag@@ glut@@ ination can only be reached when presence of certain col@@ lo@@ ids such as Rin@@ der@@ alb@@ um@@ in or with other special methods . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following requirements for the effectiveness of Ser@@ a to determine the R@@ h group may possibly change if International Standard prepar@@ ates are available . i ) Anti @-@ D ( anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) blood group ser@@ um ( human )
anti @-@ D ser@@ um is derived from the blood of one or more people , immun@@ ized by the an@@ tigen D of the R@@ h system .
it re@@ acts with human red blood cells containing an@@ tigen D , but not containing human red blood cells that do not contain the an@@ tigen D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; complete &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ D Ser@@ a must have a tit@@ er of at least 1 : 32 compared to C@@ c@@ De@@ e &apos;s blood cells in a 0,@@ 9@@ percent cooking solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a &quot; complete &quot; anti @-@ D ser@@ um is parallel to the re@@ dissolved , but un@@ diluted International standard preparations of the in@@ complete anti @-@ D ( anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) ser@@ um or corresponding equivalent of the C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells .
in addition to a reaction with all red blood cells containing the an@@ tigen D , the ser@@ um is intended to respond with blood cells , the Do @-@ An@@ tigen .
anti @-@ D Ser@@ a , which are used to use slides according to the test after Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , have to have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds , and the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be complete within 120 seconds .
anti @-@ C ser@@ um is derived from the blood of one or more people , immun@@ ized by the ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ogen C of the R@@ h system .
it re@@ acts with floods of human blood cells containing an@@ tigen C , but not containing human red blood cells that do not contain the C an@@ tigen .
therefore , these ser@@ a are only specific for the C an@@ tigen , when the tested blood cells are weak@@ ened in a 0,@@ 9@@ percent sal@@ ine solution .
the tit@@ er of the Anti @-@ C Ser@@ a ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; complete &quot; ) must be at least 1 : 8 compared to C@@ cd@@ de@@ e blood cells .

anti @-@ E Serum is extracted from the blood of one or more people , immun@@ ized by the an@@ tigen E of the R@@ h system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ E Ser@@ a ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; complete &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) should have a title of at least 1 : 8 compared to C@@ c@@ dd@@ E@@ e blood cells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
anti @-@ E Ser@@ a , which may be used for use on slides according to the test after Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son ( and in no form of anti @-@ D ) , have to have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds and the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be completed within 120 seconds .
sera the specif@@ icity of anti @-@ D + -@@ C and specif@@ icity of anti @-@ D + -@@ E can be extracted directly from the blood immun@@ ised persons or can be produced by mixing of anti @-@ D with anti @-@ C or anti @-@ E ser@@ um .
in a given ser@@ um , both bodies must effectively be effective among the specified reaction conditions .

considering the existing scientific and technical data on emissions , air movements and impacts of nitrogen oxi@@ des , and their follow @-@ up products on the environment , as well as data on technologies to fight emissions ,
determined to take effective measures to fight and reduce the annual national emissions of nitrogen oxi@@ des or their inf@@ ect need@@ les , especially due to application of adequate national emissions limits for new moving larger different sources , as well as retro@@ fitting of existing larger large sources ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in knowledge that the scientific and technical knowledge on these issues develop , and that this development should be considered in the review of the application of this protocol and in the decision on further measures , &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the realization that the el@@ aboration of an effective approach based on the objective has to create an effective scientific basis for the aim of the application of the application of this protocol and in case the decision on further international agreed measures should be considered , &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the realization that the zu@@ eg@@ oti@@ ated testing of methods to create more favorable conditions for a technology exchange of nitrogen oxi@@ des in the Commission of the Commission is to contribute , &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with satisfaction to consider that several states have committed themselves to emphas@@ ize their annual national emissions from nitrogen oxi@@ des , and to substantial levels . &quot; &quot; &quot;
