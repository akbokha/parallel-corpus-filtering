it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , than 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of hot tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , as a solution to intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as a injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. wir@@ res thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , di@@ str@@ ust and del@@ u@@ sions ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , a mental disorder in which patients have man@@ ic episodes ( periods of abnormal high spirits ) alternat@@ ely with periods of normal tuning .
Abi@@ li@@ fy is used for the treatment of severe and severe therapeutic episodes and prevention of man@@ ic episodes in patients who have been addressed to the medicine in the past .
the injection solution is used for fast control of stressed un@@ rest or behavi@@ oral problems if the oral in@@ gest@@ ion of drug is not possible .
in both diseases , the solution can be used to insert or use melting tablets in patients , which prepar@@ es the swal@@ lowing of tablets .
in patients who simultaneously use other medicines , the same as Abi@@ li@@ fy should be removed , the dose of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be adjusted .
this affects the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ter , &quot; i.e. chemical substances which enable communication of nerve cells to another .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol is believed to appear especially as &quot; partial Ag@@ ist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ter Dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( called ser@@ otonin ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol as 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin , and d@@ op@@ amine , but in lower dimensions as the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ter seems to activate the recept@@ ors .
since d@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin play a role in sch@@ izophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , helps norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , preventing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms , and their restart is prevented .
the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy to prevent re@@ birth of symptoms , was investigated in three studies via up to one year .
the effectiveness of the injection solution was evaluated in two studies in 80@@ 5 patients with sch@@ izophren@@ ia or similar diseases , compared to a placebo over a period of two hours .
in another study , Abi@@ li@@ fy was opposed to 3@@ 47 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy and placebo which had been stabili@@ zed on 160 patients , in which the man@@ ic symptoms were stabili@@ zed with Abi@@ li@@ fy .
the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution was evaluated in a study of 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , which had an un@@ ceas@@ ing distur@@ b@@ ance , compared to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic medicine ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies , the alter@@ ation of the symptoms of patients based on a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients suffering on treatment were examined .
the company also conducted trials to investig@@ ate how the body absor@@ bs melting tablets and the solution to absorb ( decre@@ asing ) .
in both studies with the injection solution patients who received Abi@@ li@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg received a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms resulting in a placebo .
in use for the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder Abi@@ li@@ fy , Abi@@ li@@ fy in four of the five short @-@ term studies lack as placebo .
in addition to 74 weeks , Abi@@ li@@ fy prevented the re@@ occurrence of Man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients and if additional treatment was administered to an existing treatment .
Abi@@ li@@ fy injec@@ tions in 10@@ - or 15 mg doses also decreased more effective than placebo perceived their symptoms and were similar to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side effects of Abi@@ li@@ fy to insert ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) , vom@@ iting , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , vom@@ iting , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , vom@@ iting , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , vom@@ iting , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , redness and exhau@@ st@@ ion , rest@@ less@@ ness , in@@ som@@ nie ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety .
the conclusion that the benefits of Ab@@ sch@@ izophren@@ ia ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of sch@@ izophren@@ ia and from moderate to serious inci@@ dents in patients who were mainly man@@ ic episodes on treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to the risks involved .
in addition , the Committee came to the result that the benefits of injection solution during quick control of stressed un@@ rest and behavi@@ oral problems in patients with mit@@ sch@@ izophren@@ ia or patients with man@@ ic episodes are not suitable , compared to the risks .
in June 2004 the European Commission adopted the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd . a permit for the transport of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the whole European Union .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of the bi@@ polar disorder and for prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients showing the mainly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day with a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
increased effectiveness in doses above a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the effectiveness of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y in the treatment of sch@@ izophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
with regard to the larger sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initial dose should be considered , if clinical factors have to justify this ( see section 4.4 ) .
when the CY@@ P3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is removed from combination therapy , the arith@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ ary behaviour belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after changing an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy ( see section 4.8 ) .
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that patients with bi@@ polar disorder mean no increased risk of risk with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol should be treated with caution in patients with well @-@ known cardi@@ ov@@ ascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ suffici@@ ency , over@@ power@@ ing disorders ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease , conditions that can be applied for hyp@@ ot@@ ony and hypertension ( including acute and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) .
3 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ es@@ ias : in clinical trials that observed one year or less , there were occas@@ ional reports on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol occurring Dy@@ nasty .
when patients treated with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y patients and symptoms of late dy@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia should be taken , should reduce the dose or break the treatment .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms resulting in a m@@ ns , or un@@ clear high fever without any additional clinical manifest@@ ation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , must be set .
therefore Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol should be used in patients with sei@@ zu@@ res in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese or at the conditions related to sei@@ zu@@ res , with caution .
56 - 99 years old with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol in patients with psych@@ osis related to Alzheimer &apos;s disease had patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , an increased risk of death compared to placebo .
however , there was one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the response to unwanted cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol treated patients .
Hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with K@@ eto@@ azi@@ z or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma or death , was reported in patients who were treated with atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic compounds including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
there is no precise risk assessment regarding hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia @-@ related events associated with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y and other atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic compounds to patients who allow direct compar@@ isons .
Poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , polym@@ ers , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , or risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should regularly be monitored in terms of deteri@@ oration of glucose levels .
a weight gain is generally observed in sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar mania due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ d@@ ities , which is known for weight gain than side effects , and could lead to serious complications .
due to the primary effects of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol on the central nervous system , caution is advis@@ able if Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol is used in combination with alcohol or other centr@@ alized medicines such as se@@ dation ( see section 4.8 ) .
the H2 @-@ ant@@ agonist Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ in , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is not considered clin@@ ically ir@@ relevant .
in a clinical study with healthy volunteers a highly effective CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Chin@@ id@@ in ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol by 107 % while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
it is expected to have other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , similar effects and therefore should have similar dos@@ ing reductions .
the joint application of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; Po@@ or &quot; ) can result in joint application with high @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P3@@ A4 from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol compared to CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ si@@ veness Met@@ abol@@ ism .
if one considers the joint gift of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other high @-@ effective CY@@ P3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , the potential benefits should exceed the potential risks for the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ ein@@ ase inhibit@@ ors , may have similar effects and therefore should have similar dos@@ ing reductions .
after placing the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dose of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be increased to the dos@@ ing height before the beginning of the accompanying therapy .
di@@ le@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ( or CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ) together with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y can be administered together with a moderate increase in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
in clinical studies , doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol had no significant impact on the metabolism of the sub@@ str@@ ates of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ method@@ xy@@ cyc@@ ine @-@ R@@ atio ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( O@@ me@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ) and 3@@ A4 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) .
patients should be advised to inform their doctor if they are pregnant or planning a pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol .
due to the in@@ sufficient data situation for the human being and due to the concerns regarding the human rights , this drug may not be applied in the pregnancy , unless the potential benefits just@@ i@@ fies the potential risk for the fet@@ us .
however , in other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned of using dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , including motor vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole does not have any negative influence .
the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medical @-@ related side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
sch@@ izophren@@ ia - in a controlled long @-@ term study over 52 weeks joined patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , a total of lower incidence ( 25,@@ 8 % ) , including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ is@@ ie , D@@ yst@@ ony and Dy@@ cor@@ in@@ esia , compared with patients who were treated with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol ( 5@@ 7,3 % ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , incidence of EPS 19 % was included in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol treatment and 13,@@ 1 % in patients under Plac@@ ebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % was treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , 15.@@ 1 % in patients under O@@ lan@@ zap@@ per therapy .
therapeutic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder - In a controlled study above 12 weeks the incidence of EPS amounted to 23@@ ,5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3,3 % in patients under Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol treatment .
in another study above 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26,@@ 6 % showed in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium @-@ treatment .
during the long @-@ time period , over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled trial was the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for placebo treated patients .
a comparison between patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol and placebo in which potentially clin@@ ically controlled laboratory parameters were found , yiel@@ ded no medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases the C@@ p@@ k ( cre@@ atine @-@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and as@@ y@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
to the side effects , which may occur in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , the mal@@ ig@@ ne neuro@@ le@@ pt@@ osis , sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esis and increased mortality in elderly dementia cases , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ inten@@ tionally or deliber@@ ate over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol has been observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death sequence .
although no information about the efficacy of a hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis in treating an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , it is unlikely that hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose of use is , da Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has a high plasma binding .
it is assumed that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol in sch@@ izophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder on the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on d@@ op@@ amine and ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ - recept@@ ors and an ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors will be convey@@ ed .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed a high aff@@ inity for d@@ op@@ amine and D3 @-@ recept@@ or and ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- and 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ or as well as a moderate aff@@ inity for d@@ op@@ amine D@@ 4- , for ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , for alpha @-@ 1 @-@ rep@@ in@@ ep@@ y and to the hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ recept@@ or .
in the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol in dos@@ ages of 0.5 to 30 mg once a day over 2 weeks of healthy subjects showed the positive @-@ dependent reduction of the combination of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 recept@@ or lig@@ ands , at the Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and on the coup .
in three placebo @-@ controlled trial studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) in 1.@@ 228 sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients showed a statist@@ ically significant improvement of psych@@ otic symptoms in comparison to placebo .
in a week 52 of the study conducted in a Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol study enrolled in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values of measuring scales , which were defined as secondary studies , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery - depression rate , showed significantly stronger improvement than at Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study , more than 26 weeks in stabili@@ zed patients with chronic sch@@ izophren@@ ia was significantly higher reduction in recur@@ rence , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ol group and 57 % below placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ in @-@ controlled , multin@@ ational double @-@ blind study included in sch@@ izophren@@ ia ( N = 18 or 13 % of the analysis value ) in significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the output value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg ) with an average weight of approx . 5 kg .
in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with a flexible or mixed Episode of Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ Dis@@ order , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed a placebo @-@ superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dose of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed Episode of Bi@@ polar @-@ I Dis@@ order , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed no superior effectiveness .
in two plac@@ ebo@@ arding and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar element , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed a comparison to placebo superior effectiveness in week 3 and a response effect that was comparable to that of lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol in week 12 .
in week 12 Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol also demonstrated a comparable share of patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic re@@ mission of the mania to like lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled trial over 6 weeks with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar disorder study , with or without psych@@ otic diseases , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol revealed a superior effectiveness in reduction Man@@ ic symptoms compared to the Mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate .
10 In a placebo @-@ controlled study , over 26 weeks , followed by a long @-@ term expansion phase about 74 weeks before a stabili@@ zation phase , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was superior to placebo in regard to prevention of a bi@@ polar return case , predominantly in prevention of a decline in the Man@@ ia .
based on in vitro studies , the enzymes of CY@@ P@@ 6 and CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for the Deh@@ ydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ ation of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , the N @-@ De@@ al@@ k@@ yl@@ ation is cataly@@ sed by CY@@ P3@@ A4 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the mean elim@@ ination period of approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole through CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and for nearly 146 hours at &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; Po@@ or &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ is@@ ers via CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy subjects , as well as a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study of sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients showed no gender @-@ dependent effects .
a pop@@ uli@@ ar @-@ specific analysis for pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics was found no indication of clin@@ ically significant differences in the eth@@ ics or the effect of smoking at the Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol were similar in patients with severe kidney failure in comparison to young healthy volunteers .
a single dose study involving human liver cir@@ rh@@ osis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the impact of the liver function to the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , but the study included only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis of the class C , which is not enough to draw conclusions to their met@@ abolic capacity .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity in repeated gift , reproduction , res@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and for can@@ o@@ gene@@ ous potential , the pre @-@ clinical data showed no special dangers for human beings .
Tox@@ ic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only during dos@@ ages or exposure , which clearly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans , so they have limited liability for clinical application only limited or no meaning .

there is no precise risk assessment regarding hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia @-@ related events associated with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y and other atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic compounds to patients who allow direct compar@@ isons .
92 In a clinical study with healthy volunteers , a highly effective CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Chin@@ id@@ in ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol by 107 % while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
di@@ le@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ( or CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ) together with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y can be administered together with a moderate increase in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
current episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder - In a controlled study above 12 weeks the incidence of EPS amounted to 23@@ ,5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ -
it is assumed that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol in sch@@ izophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder on the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on d@@ op@@ amine and ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ - recept@@ ors and an ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors will be convey@@ ed .
in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ in @-@ controlled , multin@@ ational double @-@ blind study included in sch@@ izophren@@ ia ( N = 18 or 13 % of the analysis value ) in significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the output value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg ) with an average weight of approx . 5 kg .
97 In a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dose of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed Episode of Bi@@ polar @-@ I Dis@@ order , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed no superior effectiveness .
in a relative bi@@ over@@ coming study , in which the Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol was compared with healthy volunteers , the ratio was compared to the geomet@@ ric C@@ max level of the solution and the value of tablets at 122 % ( N = 30 ) .
99 Fur@@ thermore , there was found a cholesterol drug in the bile duct of Hydro@@ xy@@ - Met@@ abol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol in the G@@ alle of monkeys according to repeated oral @-@ state @-@ exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ times of the recommended maximum dose when people based on mg / m2 ) .
in rab@@ bits these effects were observed by dos@@ ages , which led to Ex@@ positions of 3- and 11 times the medium Ste@@ ady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y injection solution is used to quickly control ag@@ iti@@ vity and behavi@@ ors in patients with sch@@ izophren@@ ia or patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder when oral therapy is not appropriate .
once it is clin@@ ically appropriate , treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol injection solution should be termin@@ ated and started with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol .
to minim@@ ize res@@ or@@ ption and minim@@ ize the vari@@ ability , an injection is recommended in the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle underneath the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle underneath the circum@@ stance of obes@@ e regions .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.7 ml ) may be given on an individual clinical status taking into account the medicine used already for conservation or acute therapy ( see section 4.5 ) .
if a detailed oral treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol is inde@@ xed , see the summary of the characteristics of the drug to AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y tablets , AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y pills , or AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y solution .
there are no exam@@ inations on the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol injec@@ tions in patients with ag@@ iti@@ vity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , which were different from sch@@ izophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder .
if a par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ine is used in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol injection solution as necessary , patients should be observed in extreme se@@ dation or blood pressure ( see section 4.5 ) .
investigations on safety and effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug pois@@ oning ( by pet@@ ri@@ dden or illegal drugs ) .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol should be treated with caution in patients with well @-@ known cardi@@ ov@@ ascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ suffici@@ ency , over@@ power@@ ing disorders ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease , conditions that can be applied for hyp@@ ot@@ ony and hypertension ( including acute and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) .
late dy@@ dy@@ sk@@ ies : in clinical trials that observed one year or less , there were occas@@ ional reports on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol occurring Dy@@ nasty .
clinical manifest@@ ations of a m@@ ns are high fever , muscle sti@@ ff@@ ness , changing consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , speed@@ ometer , swe@@ ating and heart rhythm disorders ) .
Poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , polym@@ ers , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , or risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should regularly be monitored in terms of deteri@@ oration of glucose levels .
a weight gain is generally observed in sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar mania due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ d@@ ities , which is known for weight gain than side effects , and could lead to serious complications .
nevertheless , the intensity of the Sed@@ ation greater compared to the sole gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , in a study found in the healthy volunteers Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ( 15 mg dose ) , and the same time Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) received in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ arly .
105 The H2 @-@ ant@@ agonist Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ in , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , decre@@ ases the Res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , but this effect is not considered clin@@ ically ir@@ relevant .
in contrast to CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; Po@@ or &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ is@@ ers can result in a joint application with high @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and H@@ IV@@ - Prot@@ ected inhibit@@ ors , may have similar effects and therefore should have similar dos@@ ing reductions .
after placing the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dose of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be increased to the dos@@ ing height before the beginning of the accompanying therapy .
106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ arly received was the intensity of Sed@@ ation greater compared to the sole gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol .
the following adverse events were more common in clinical trials with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol injec@@ tions ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medical @-@ relevant side effects ( * ) ( see section 5.1 ) :
the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
107 The following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than in placebo or were classified as possible medical effects ( * ) as possible medical effects ( * ) ( see section 5.1 ) :
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , incidence of EPS 19 % was included in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13,@@ 1 % in patients under Plac@@ ebo .
in another study above 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26,@@ 6 % showed in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium @-@ treatment .
during the long @-@ time period , over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled trial was the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for placebo treated patients .
a comparison between patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol and placebo in which potentially clin@@ ically controlled laboratory parameters were found , yiel@@ ded no medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases the C@@ p@@ k ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and as@@ y@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
to the side effects , which may occur in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , the mal@@ ig@@ ne neuro@@ le@@ pt@@ osis , sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esis and increased mortality in elderly dementia cases , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders was associated with statist@@ ically significant improvements of ag@@ it@@ ability / behavi@@ ors associated with placebo and was similar to Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled trial ( 24 h ) with 291 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as ag@@ iti@@ vity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , was associated with a statist@@ ically significant improvement in comparison to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm .
the mean improvement from the bas@@ eline value on the P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score at the primary 2 hours end was 5.8 for placebo , 9,6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol .
in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe ag@@ iti@@ ability , a similar efficacy in relation to total population was observed , but a statistical significance could be determined because of a reduced patient number .
in three placebo @-@ controlled trial studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) in 1.@@ 228 sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients showed a statist@@ ically significant improvement of psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a week 52 of the study conducted in a Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol study enrolled in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol 77 % ( oral ) and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % in both groups .
current values of measuring scales , which were defined as secondary studies , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg @-@ depres@@ sions scale , showed significantly stronger improvement than at Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks in stabili@@ zed patients with chronic sch@@ izophren@@ ia was a significantly higher reduction in the recur@@ rence , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % below placebo .
in an O@@ end@@ omet@@ ra @-@ controlled , multin@@ ational double @-@ blind study included in sch@@ izophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , a weight gain of at least 7 % showed a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the output value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg ) with an average weight of approx . 5 kg .
111 In a placebo @-@ controlled trial over 6 weeks with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar disorder study , with or without psych@@ otic diseases , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol resulted in a superior effectiveness in reduction Man@@ ic symptoms compared to the Mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study in man@@ ic patients who had achieved a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to placebo for a bi @-@ polar return case , predominantly in prevention of a revers@@ al in the Man@@ ia .
in the first 2 hours of in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection 90 % the AU@@ C is according to the gift of the same dose as tablet ; system@@ ic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations .
in 2 studies with healthy volunteers , the mean time until reaching the maximum plasma level lasted from 1 to 3 hours .
the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol injection solution was toler@@ ated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct tox@@ icity of an objective response after repeated treatment with system@@ ic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , 15@@ - and 5 times above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg of in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular .
in studies for the reproduction of intraven@@ ous applications , no safety @-@ relevant concerns relating to maternal exposure , which was 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bits ) above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg .
based on conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ( oral ) for safety har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity with repeated gift , reproduction , res@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and for can@@ o@@ gene@@ ous potential , the pre @-@ clinical data showed no special dangers for humans .
Tox@@ ic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only during dos@@ ages or exposure , which clearly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans ; so they have limited liability for clinical application only limited or no meaning .
the effects of dos@@ ing @-@ dependent side effects ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ cin loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( corresponds to 10 times the medium Ste@@ ady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) in female rats at 60 mg / kg / day ( the 10 times the medium Ste@@ ady state @-@ state @-@ exposure ( AU@@ C ) during the recommended maximum dose of humans ) .
in addition , in addition to the recommended dose of sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ g@@ ums of Hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( AU@@ C ) was found at the recommended clinical dose or 16@@ - to 81 times of the recommended maximum dose when people are tested based on mg / m2 ) .
in rab@@ bits these effects were observed by dos@@ ages , which led to Ex@@ positions of 3- and 11 times the medium Ste@@ ady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a main study , at the 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which approximately three quarters were given an anth@@ ra@@ cyc@@ line .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole gift or as Mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the conventional Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
in total , 72 ( 31 % ) of the patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane treated patients to the treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 patients receiving conventional Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
only one considers the patients who were treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer , in regard to the efficacy of the disease as well as to deteri@@ oration of the disease and survival , there was no difference between medicines .
in contrast , patients who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer in relation to these indicators that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
it may also not be used in patients who still su@@ ck the breast@@ feeding or before the treatment of low Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ phil@@ en@@ figures in the blood .
the committee for human dental agents ( CH@@ MP ) stated that Abra@@ x@@ ane has not been more effective than conventional Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , and that in contrast to other Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el drugs have not been given to other medicines to reduce side effects .
January 2008 the European Commission granted Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited a permit for the transport of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the whole European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ Mon@@ otherapy is inde@@ xed for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients with which the first @-@ line therapy for metastatic disease is missing and not shown for a standard anth@@ ra@@ cyc@@ line @-@ contained therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe Ne@@ ut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie ( Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ ph@@ en@@ n &lt; 0,@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sens@@ ory re@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 .
in case of sen@@ sor@@ ial neu@@ rop@@ athy degree 3 , treatment is reduced to a degree 1 or 2 , and with all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced .
there are no adequate data for the recommendation of dos@@ is@@ iz@@ ations in patients with mild to moderate imp@@ air@@ ment of the liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no trials with patients with imp@@ aired ren@@ al function and there are no adequate data for the recommendation of dos@@ is@@ iz@@ ations in patients with imp@@ air@@ ment of kidney function ( see section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to adequate data for un@@ question@@ able and efficacy .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an Alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nano @-@ particle form@@ ulation of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el which could have much other pharmac@@ ological features as other form@@ ulations of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be removed immediately and a symp@@ tom@@ atic treatment should be introduced , and the patient must not be treated once again with Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in patients no renewed Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be introduced , until the Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ wer &apos;s number rose again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the thro@@ cy@@ te number rose again to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver function ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
while an explic@@ it with Abra@@ x@@ ane has not been proven , kar@@ di@@ ale inci@@ dents were not unusual in the inde@@ xed patient collective , especially in patients with earlier anth@@ ra@@ cyc@@ line treatment or underlying heart disease or lung disease .
in case of patients with the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting and diar@@ rho@@ ea may occur , they can be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ e@@ tics and a constant means .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be applied in pregnant or in women working age , who do not practice effective contrac@@ eption , except the treatment of mother with Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is essential .
women working at age and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane a reliable processing method should apply .
male patients who are treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane is excited , during and up to six months after the treatment no child will be witnesses .
male patients should advise the treatment of a sperm serv@@ itude , because the therapy with Abra@@ x@@ ane has the possibility of ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects like fatigue ( very frequently ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( often ) that can affect per@@ sever@@ ity and ability to serve machines .
following are the most common and important inci@@ dents of side effects , which appeared in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer , which were treated in the piv@@ ot@@ al phase III study once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane have been treated .
Ne@@ ut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie was the most striking important hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ( 79 % of patients reported ) and was rapidly reversible and dos@@ is@@ dependent ; leu@@ k@@ open@@ ia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane patients and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
in Table 1 the side effects are listed , which occurred in conjunction with the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane as a mon@@ otherapy in any dose and indication in studies have occurred ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) .
occasionally : elevated blood pressure , weight gain , increased liqu@@ or hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosph@@ orus in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood :
dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ia , pal@@ sy , tongue , dry mouth , p@@ ains of gum , loose chair , o@@ est@@ oph@@ ag@@ itis , pain in the lower , oral pain , re@@ frac@@ tal bleeding diseases of the kidneys and ur@@ inary tract :

rest@@ less@@ ness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definite event in a population of 7@@ 89 patients
as these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of actual frequency are possible and no caus@@ al connection with these events was established .
Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an anti@@ mi@@ kr@@ ot@@ ub@@ uli @-@ active substance that supports the lag@@ ging of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tube indi@@ ces and stabili@@ zed the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules through inhibit@@ ing their de@@ oly@@ mer@@ isation .
this stabili@@ zation brings to a in@@ hibition of normal dynamic re@@ organisation of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network that is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell@@ functions .
it is known that Alb@@ um@@ in is medi@@ ated by the Trans@@ cy@@ t@@ osis of Plas@@ ma@@ om@@ pon@@ ent in end@@ ot@@ hel@@ ial cells and in the context of in @-@ vitro studies , that the presence of Alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el by end@@ ot@@ hel@@ ial cells .
it is believed that this enhanced trans@@ end@@ ot@@ hel@@ ial transport is convey@@ ed by the g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ Alb@@ umin@@ ous recept@@ or and due to the alb@@ um@@ bin@@ dering protein SP@@ ARC ( secre@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) a pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation in the field of tum@@ ors .
the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data of 106 patients in two un@@ prec@@ ari@@ ably blind@@ ed studies and of 4@@ 54 patients who were treated in a random@@ ised Phase III comparison study .
in a study , 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion for 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an in@@ fusion for 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this multic@@ entr@@ e study was carried out in patients with metastatic breast cancer , which received a 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion to the prevention of an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without pre@@ medi@@ ation ( N = 229 ) .
in the study , 64 % of patients had an imp@@ aired universal status ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases .
14 % of patients had not received chemotherapy before , 27 % had only ad@@ ju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of metast@@ ases and 19 % due to metast@@ ases and ad@@ ju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 Results for the general response rate and time to progression free survival and progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients suffering from first @-@ line therapy are shown below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity versus Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by the improvement to a degree of patients that were evaluated at a time during the therapy a peri@@ ph@@ ere neu@@ rop@@ athy degree 3 was evaluated .
due to the natural course of peripher@@ al neu@@ rop@@ athy on bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative tox@@ icity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses were not evaluated and is still unknown .
the Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the total @-@ pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fu@@ sions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 has been determined in clinical trials .
the active ingredient ( AU@@ C ) increased linear from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml . analog@@ ous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 According to the intraven@@ ous gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma concentration took off in a multi @-@ phase .
the medium distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume indicates an extensive ex@@ trav@@ ascular distribution and / or soft@@ ly part of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study with advanced solid tum@@ ors , pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were compared with IV mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane with the values of a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 m@@ g. / m2 of solvent containing a 3 @-@ hour injection .
the Clear@@ ance of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher after the Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ Gift higher ( 43 % ) than after a solvent containing Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and also the distribution volume was Abra@@ x@@ ane higher ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature on human liver micro@@ some and tissue coating is reported that Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is primarily associated with 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and two smaller Met@@ abol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed .
after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer was 4 % of the given total dose with less than 1 % of the Met@@ abol@@ ites 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 3 &quot; -@@ p hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which indicates an extensive non @-@ ren@@ al clearing .
over 75 years of age , however , only few data are available because only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis .
the chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and light light over 8 hours .

&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological drug , which is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same active substance ( also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reference drug &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is used in patients with normal blood vessels in which , in connection with a blood trans@@ fusion complications may occur , if before the surgery is not possible , and with which a blood loss is expected from 900 to 1 800 ml .
treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be introduced under the supervision of a doctor , who owns the experience in the treatment of patients with ill@@ nesses , for which the medicine is indicated .
in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make up their own blood , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a v@@ ene .
the injection can also be made by the patient or his wife , if they have received a proper instruction .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al failure or in patients receiving chemotherapy , the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ings should always be in the recommended area ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ imal ( between 10 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron values of all patients are to be used prior to treatment , to ensure that no iron deficiency exists , and ice @-@ energy supplements should be given throughout the treatment .
in patients who receive chemotherapy or patients with kidney problems , a disease can be caused by an Er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ i@@ et@@ ine deficiency , or caused the body to su@@ stain the body &apos;s own er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ i@@ etin .
Er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ i@@ etin is also used to increase the number of red blood cells to reduce the consequences of blood loss .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced to em@@ power@@ ment it to the formation of ep@@ oxy .
Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared with an injection as an injection of 4@@ 79 patients suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems , as compared to the reference drug .
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected to E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o for at least eight weeks before they were either returned to Ab@@ se@@ amed or to continue to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
main indi@@ ces for the effectiveness was the change of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ings between the beginning of the study and the evaluation period in weeks 25 to 29 .
moreover , the company laid down the results of a study in which the effects of under the skin spec@@ kled se@@ se@@ amed with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o were examined with 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy .
in the study of patients suffering from kidney problems , the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ings suffered from patients who were re@@ amed down to ab@@ out@@ amed , such as those who continue to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
in comparison , the patients who continue to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o received an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which can occasionally lead to symptoms of an en@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy ( brain @-@ problems ) like sudden , continuous mig@@ rate head@@ aches and ag@@ itation .
Ab@@ se@@ amed may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against ep@@ o@@ etin or one of other components .
Ab@@ se@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems , as further studies are required to ensure that this is caused by no allergic reactions .
the conclusion to conclude that the medicine was provided for Ab@@ se@@ amed under the regulations of the European Union , that the medicines has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company dedicated to Ab@@ se@@ amed is to provide information on the medical staff in all Member States , including information about the safety of the medicine .
in August 2007 , the European Commission granted medi@@ ce drugs P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG approved a approval for the transport of Ab@@ se@@ amed throughout the European Union .

treatment should be performed only in patients with moderate an@@ emia ( hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin &#91; b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#93; , no iron deficiency , if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or in@@ adequate , with a large blood volume rate ( 4 or more units blood in women ; 5 or more units blood in men ) .
for a reduction of external bl@@ ut , Ab@@ se@@ amed can be applied to an adult surgery under adult without iron deficiency in which a high risk of transfer@@ able applications is expected .
HB 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml will be applied , which cannot participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous bleeding program .
hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin target concentration lies between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6,2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , except for p@@ ä@@ di@@ at@@ ric patients , where hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ations should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5,@@ 9 - 6,8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
anon@@ ym@@ ity symptoms and symptoms can be different depending on age , sex and total disease load ; therefore the evaluation of individual clinical diagnosis and health insur@@ rection is required by the doctor .
a rise in hem@@ og@@ glob@@ ins around more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ings may occasionally be observed on or under the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ - target concentration .
in view of these hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ aries , the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to reach 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) is needed .
if the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ wert is increasing by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the permanent hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the ep@@ oxy @-@ al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that ep@@ o@@ etin is in the lowest @-@ approved dose , which is required for control of an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ tigen symptoms .
these clinical results indicate that patients with initial very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients with which initial an@@ emia is less heavy ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the present clinical results indicate that patients with initial very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients with which initial an@@ emia is less heavy ( H@@ b &gt; 6,8 g / dl or &gt; 4,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
starting dose 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times per week by an intraven@@ ous application , if necessary with a dos@@ ing increase of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times per week ) , until the desired finish is reached ( this should be done in steps of at least 4 weeks ) .
anon@@ ym@@ ity symptoms and - fol@@ lic@@ ations may vary depending on age , sex and total disease load ; hence , the assessment of individual clinical diagnosis and health insur@@ rection is required by the doctor .
in view of these hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ aries , the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to reach 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) is needed .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that ep@@ o@@ etin is required in the lowest @-@ approved dose , which is required for control of the applic@@ atory symptoms .
if after 4 treatment weeks of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ es increased by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the reag@@ ent number of ≥ 40.000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the output value , the dose should be maintained by 150 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg once a week .
if the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ grew &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the reag@@ ent number has increased than 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the output value , the dose should be increased to 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week .
if after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.@@ U. / kg ( ≥ 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the reag@@ ent number of ≥ 40.000 cells / µ@@ l has increased , the dose should be maintained by 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week .
however , the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ value increased by &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the reag@@ ent number of &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the reag@@ ents of the ep@@ ic @-@ al@@ fa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be canc@@ eled .
patients with mild an@@ emia ( hem@@ ato@@ cr@@ ats 33 - 39 % ) , in which the pre@@ dispos@@ ing of ≥ 4 blood c@@ ots is required , Ab@@ se@@ amed should receive a dose of 600 I.@@ U. of body weight twice a week for 3 weeks before the surgery .
with the iron subst@@ itution should be as early as possible - for example , a few weeks before the start of the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood flow program - started to make major iron reserves before the start of ab@@ se@@ amed therapy .
6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. of ep@@ oxy , which should be given weekly for three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before the surgery and the day of the intervention ( day 0 ) .

patients with sudden impact , defined as a reduction of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ings ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) , with increased need of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ resc@@ ence ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) , should be investigated and the usual causes of non @-@ provo@@ cation ( ice @-@ tox@@ ication , infections or inflammation , blood loss and ha@@ em@@ oly@@ sis ) .
if the reag@@ ent value is used , considering the an@@ a@@ emia ( i.e. the reag@@ ents &quot; Index &quot; ) , the plat@@ el@@ cy@@ te and leu@@ ko@@ cy@@ te numbers are normal , and if no other reason is found , the anti @-@ er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ etin antibody should be determined and an investigation of the bone marks to diagnose an PR@@ CA .

8 For patients with chronic ren@@ al suffici@@ ency should not exceed the recommended upper limit of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin target concentration under Section 4.2 .
in clinical studies , an increased mortality risk and risk for severe cardi@@ ov@@ ascular events were observed when er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ ese stimul@@ ating agents ( ESA ) were given with a hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ - target concentration of over 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefits , which is attri@@ but@@ able to the gift of ep@@ oxy symptoms , if the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ations will be increased by the concentration of angi@@ ography and avoiding blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ations should be approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minim@@ ize the risk of an increase in hypertension .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency and clinical evidence cor@@ on@@ ar@@ er heart disease or heart failure , under Section 4.2 the recommended upper limit of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin target concentration should not be exceeded .
according to the current detection , it is not accelerated due to the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with ep@@ o@@ in@@ suffici@@ ency in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which is not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency does not accelerated .
for the assessment of therapy efficiency of ep@@ oxy @-@ fa a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between ep@@ oxy @-@ al@@ fa gift and the er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ etin response should be considered ( patients who may need to be trans@@ f@@ ished ) .
if the H@@ b increase is exceeded as 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must minim@@ ize the risk for possible thro@@ mb@@ otic events ( see section 4.2 treatment of patients with chem@@ otherap@@ eutic attack between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
the decision for application re@@ combin@@ ant er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit risk reduction in particular patients who should consider the specific clinical context .
in patients who are en@@ vis@@ aged for a larger electric @-@ orthop@@ ae@@ dic procedure , if possible , the cause of an@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly .
patients who undergo an increased orthop@@ ae@@ dic procedure should have a proper Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ osis proph@@ yla@@ xis , as they have an increased risk of thro@@ mb@@ otic and v@@ ascular diseases , especially in a underlying cardi@@ ov@@ ascular disease .
furthermore , it cannot be excluded that treatment with ep@@ oxy @-@ fa for patients with an initial risk factor of &gt; 13 g / dl can consist of an increased risk of postoperative thro@@ mb@@ otic / v@@ ascular events .
in several controlled trials , ep@@ oxy was not proven to improve the overall survival in tumor patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic an@@ emia .
4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer , chemotherapy was given back when a hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8,7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was targeted
if ep@@ oxy is used together with Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be controlled and the Cic@@ los@@ por@@ ous osis will be adapted to the rising hem@@ at@@ ok@@ rit .
in @-@ vitro studies on tumor woven , there are no evidence of an interaction between ep@@ oxy and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F regarding cro@@ mat@@ ological differentiation or prolifer@@ ation .
over thro@@ mb@@ otic , v@@ ascular events such as m@@ yo@@ car@@ di@@ ale in@@ surg@@ ents , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ osis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ osis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ osis , and 11 blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys was reported in patients under Er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ etin , so also patients under ep@@ o@@ etin , reported .
the most common side effect during the treatment with ep@@ oxy is a dos@@ cope @-@ dependent rise of blood pressure or deteri@@ oration of an existing hyper@@ ton@@ ia .
an increased incidence of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ v@@ ascular events ( see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General ) was observed in patients under treatment with Er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ ines .

survival and tumor secon@@ om@@ ies were examined in five large controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled studies and
in the open study , there was no difference between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ etin treated patients and the control patients .
in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ etin treated patients with a an@@ emia due to several common mal@@ ign@@ es , statist@@ ically significantly higher mortality than in controls .
overall survival in studies could not be explained by differences in incidence of thro@@ mb@@ osis and associated complications in with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ etin treated patients and inspec@@ tions .
there is an increased risk for thro@@ m@@ bo@@ em@@ bol@@ ian events in tum@@ our patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ etin , and a negative impact on overall survival can &apos;t be excluded .
it is not clari@@ fied , how far these results are treated to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ etin in tum@@ our patients with the aim of transfer@@ ing a hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ wert under 13 g / dl , as a few patients were included with these characteristics in the previous data .
ep@@ oxy @-@ al@@ fa provisions according to repeated intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life of approximately 4 hours for healthy volunteers and a somewhat extended half @-@ life of approximately 5 hours in patients with kidney failure .

during the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed alone , it may come back to a slight dos@@ ing @-@ dependent increase in blood cl@@ adding number , which re@@ forms to further treatment .
if necessary , your doctor will perform regular blood tests in order to regularly control the number of blood plat@@ el@@ ets during the first 8 weeks of treatment .
iron deficiency , dis@@ solution of red blood cells ( ha@@ em@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12@@ - or fo@@ res@@ o@@ deficiency , should be taken into account and before the start of treatment with se@@ ab@@ amed .
very seldom has been reported on the appearance of an antique er@@ y@@ thro@@ bl@@ ast@@ open@@ ia after mon@@ ate@@ - until years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin spec@@ kled ) er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ etin .
if you suffer from er@@ y@@ thro@@ bl@@ ast@@ open@@ ia , he will break down your therapy with ab@@ outs , as your an@@ a@@ emia is best treated .
therefore Ab@@ se@@ amed must be given through injec@@ tions in a v@@ ene ( intraven@@ ous ) if you are treated because of an@@ a@@ emia due to kidney illness .
a high hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ wert reduces the risk of problems with heart or blood vessels and the death can be increased .
for elevated or increasing the potassium , your doctor may consider an inter@@ ruption of treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed , until the potassium values are in the normal range .
if you suffer from chronic kidney disease and clin@@ ically apparent cor@@ on@@ ar@@ er heart disease or dam by in@@ sufficient heart rate , your doctor will ensure that your hem@@ og@@ lo@@ resc@@ ence does not exceed a particular value .
according to the present knowledge , due to the treatment of blood poverty with ab@@ se@@ amed for adults with chronic ren@@ al failure ( kidney failure ) , which are still not di@@ aly@@ sis , the progression of kidney failure is not accelerated .
a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between ep@@ o@@ etin al@@ fa gift and the desired effect should be considered to assess the effectiveness of Ab@@ se@@ amed .
200 Your doctor regularly determine your values of the red blood color ( hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin ) and adapt your query amed dose accordingly to keep the risk of blood sugar ( thro@@ mb@@ otic event ) as possible .
this risk should be thoroughly balanced compared to the treatment with ep@@ o@@ etin al@@ fa , especially if you are obes@@ e ( adi@@ p@@ y ) or if you are obes@@ e ( adi@@ p@@ y ) or when in the past already thro@@ mb@@ otic v@@ ascular events occurred ( e.g. a deep ven@@ er@@ ro@@ mb@@ osis or pneum@@ em@@ bo@@ lie ) .
in case you are cancer patients , consider that Ab@@ se@@ amed may affect how a growth factor for blood cells and under certain circumstances affect the tumor .
if a larger orthop@@ e@@ dic operation is im@@ min@@ ent , before treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly .
if your values of the red blood color ( hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin ) are too high , you should not receive Ab@@ se@@ amed because there is an increased risk of blood drops after surgery .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use other drugs / apply or applied recently , even if it is not prescri@@ ption medicine .
if you are using Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means to supp@@ ress the immune system ) during your treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor may be assigned certain blood tests to measure the blood levels of Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
laboratory studies have shown no interaction between ep@@ o@@ etin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F are means of building immune system , for example , for cancer chemotherapy or HIV ) .
depending on how your blood arm@@ ist ( an@@ emia ) speaks to the treatment , the dose may be adjusted for every four weeks until your condition is under control .
your doctor may also assign regular blood tests to check the treatment success and make sure that the medicine works properly and does not exceed your hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ wert as a given value .
once you are well tuned , you will receive regular doses of Ab@@ se@@ amed between 25 and 50 i.@@ E. / kg twice a week , distributed to two equal injec@@ tions .
if necessary , your doctor will arrange regular blood tests to check the treatment success and make sure your hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ value does not exceed a particular value .
depending on how the an@@ a@@ emia is attached to the treatment , the dose may be adjusted for every four weeks until the condition is under control .
to ensure this and ensure that the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ value does not exceed a particular value , the treat@@ able physician will perform regular blood tests .
if it is necessary to reduce the treatment time before the surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg can be given on 10 consecutive days before the surgery , on the day of the intervention and another 4 days after the surgery .
however , if your doctor keeps this appropriate , you can also learn how to sp@@ it yourself under the skin .
heart , heart attacks , brain bleeding , cereb@@ ral thro@@ mb@@ osis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ osis , v@@ ascular extensions ( an@@ neur@@ ys@@ ms ) , thro@@ mb@@ osis of ret@@ ina and blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys were reported in patients under Er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ etin treatment .

A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is used to treat the following diseases : • oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes bones br@@ ittle ) both in women after men@@ opause and in men .
it is used in patients with a high risk of fra@@ cture ( bone break@@ through@@ s ) , including patients who have suffered a low @-@ trau@@ matic th@@ rift valley , as they suffered ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with hat@@ s should get a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) or@@ ally or injec@@ tions in a muscle .
the administration of Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means against inflammation ) shortly after the application of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a may reduce symptoms , such as fever , muscle pain , gri@@ pp@@ e@@ similar symptoms , joint pain and head@@ aches .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a must only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of this disease .
as the active ingredient in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is the same as in Zom@@ eta , a part of the data material for zom@@ eta was attracted to the assessment of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a .
in the first study , almost 8 000 elderly women with oste@@ opor@@ osis were involved , and the number of sp@@ inal and hip frac@@ tures were examined over a period of three years .
the second study included 2 127 male and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis , over 50 years , who had suffered a hip fra@@ cture , the number of frac@@ tures has been investigated for a period of up to five years .
in two studies , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was tested in two studies involving 3@@ 57 patients and compared with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) for six months .
the main indi@@ k@@ ator for the effectiveness was whether the content of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in ser@@ um ( an enzyme that builds bone tissue ) in the blood again or at least 75 % compared to the initial basis .
in the study with older women the risk of sp@@ ine frac@@ tures under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( without any other oste@@ opor@@ os@@ em@@ edi@@ cal industry ) was reduced over a period of three years compared to placebo in placebo by 70 % .
in comparison of all patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( with or without any other oste@@ opor@@ os@@ em@@ edi@@ cal , the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % .
in the study involving men and women with hat@@ ine fra@@ cture 9 % of patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a had a Fra@@ ktur ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) in comparison to 13 % of patients under placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most side effects of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less frequent with repeated in@@ fusion .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a must not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron , or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any of the other components .
as with all Bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients are subject to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to the in@@ fusion hub and oste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose ( extin@@ ction of bone tissue ) in the jaw .
the manufacturer of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a provides recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance material for physi@@ cians , which contains A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , as well as the drug may apply to patients in which the side effects of the drug are explained and pointed out when they should turn to the doctor .
in April 2005 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ artis Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited to submit a licence for the transport of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a throughout the European Union .

the patient information package should be provided and the following core messages include : • The packaging process • contra@@ indication of calcium and vitamin D , adequate physical activity , non @-@ smoking and healthy diet • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms for severe side effects • When looking for medical or n@@ ursing help
treating oste@@ opor@@ osis • in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip fra@@ cture .
for treating post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men , an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended once a year .
in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic error correction , an in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended for two or more weeks following the operational supply of the hip fra@@ cture ( see section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
after treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a a long @-@ emission period was observed in patients who have been addressed to therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
additionally , it is very advis@@ able to provide patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get an adequate intake of calcium , accordingly twice daily at least 500 mg of elem@@ ental calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic error correction , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5.000 I.@@ U. , or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before the first A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in@@ fusion .
the frequency of symptoms occurring in the first three days following the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a may be reduced by means of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen , after the application of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a .
patients with kidney function ( see section 4.4 ) In patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended to provide a limited clinical experience for this patient group .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adjustment is not necessary because the bio@@ availability , distribution and elim@@ ination in elderly patients is similar to younger .
children and adolescents A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age , since data is absent for un@@ question@@ able and efficacy .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) , there are only limited clinical experiences .
pre @-@ existing Hy@@ po@@ kal@@ z@@ emia is used prior to treatment with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a to treat sufficient supply of calcium and vitamin D ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to the rapid implementation of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ c acid on bone structure , a temporary , mit@@ tedly symp@@ tom@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia may develop , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days following the in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.8 ) .
additionally , it is very advis@@ able to provide patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get an adequate intake of calcium , corresponding to at least 500 mg of elem@@ ental calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
cancer disease , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ ost@@ ero@@ ids , bad oral hygiene ) should be considered a dental examination with a reasonable pre@@ ventive dental treatment .
for patients who require dental gri@@ ps , there are no data available , whether the inter@@ ruption of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ ate is reduced the risk for oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ ses in the jaw area .
the clinical assessment by the treated doctor should be based on the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms occurring in the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a may be reduced by means of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen , according to the application of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see Section 4.2 ) .
the frequency of reported adverse event exposed cases of atri@@ al fibr@@ ill@@ ation was increased in patients who received A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) in comparison to patients who received placebo ( 0.6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
in the oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ IZ@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Quest@@ cture Trial &#91; RF@@ T &#93; ) the total frequency of atri@@ al fibr@@ ill@@ ation was comparable between A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) .
very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , random ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) unwanted drug effects are listed in table 1 .
kidney function z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid was associated with kidney function , which occurs as decrease in kidney function ( i.e. increasing the ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute kidney failure .
the alter@@ ation of the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance ( annually before the administration ) and the appearance of kidney failure and a reduced ren@@ al function were similar in a clinical study of oste@@ opor@@ osis for three years comparable between the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a- and the placebo group .
a temporary increase in ser@@ um Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days after the gift received at 1.8 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treated patients treated with placebo treated patients .
based on the assessment of the laboratory dogs , the temporary as@@ y@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium values ( less than 2,@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) were found , with 2.3 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in a large clinical study treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get @-@ Studien treated patients .
all patients received adequate amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study for post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis , in the study on avoiding clinical symptoms after a hip fra@@ cture and in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) .
the study of vitamin D levels were not rout@@ in@@ ely measured in the study on avoiding clinical frac@@ tures , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
local reactions after administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ c acid in a large clinical study was reported on local reactions on the in@@ fusion site , such as redness , swelling and / or pain , reported ( 0.7 % ) .
oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ ses in the jaw area was particularly reported , especially for cancer patients , via oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ ses ( primary in the jaw area ) , which were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate , including z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron of fo@@ lic acid .
many of these patients had signs for local infections including oste@@ opor@@ itis , and the majority of the reports refer to cancer patient for tooth extraction or other dental attacks .
7 study with 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients found oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose in the jaw area with an A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and a placebo @-@ treated patients treated with placebo .
in case of an over@@ dose , which leads to a clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , can compens@@ ate compensation by oral calcium and / or intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate .
clinical efficacy in treating post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was indicated in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women ( 7,@@ 7@@ 36 women between 65 and 89 years ) with either a bone density , or a BM@@ D @-@ T Score for the scra@@ p as ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of existing ver@@ te@@ be@@ ous fra@@ cture .
effects on morph@@ ometric pressure frac@@ tures A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a sens@@ ed significantly over a period of three years and already after one year the frequency of one or several new ver@@ te@@ ous frac@@ tures ( see table 2 ) .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treated patients of 75 years and older had a 60 % reduced risk of sp@@ inal frac@@ tures compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.0@@ 001 ) .
effects on hip frac@@ tures A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a showed an equally lasting effect on three years ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) reduced risk for hip frac@@ tures .
effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a increased the bone density on the lum@@ bar lum@@ ps , hips and dist@@ al radius compared to placebo treatment significantly to all time points ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 Incre@@ asing the bone density of the lum@@ bar of lum@@ bar by 6.7 % , the entire hip at 6,0 % , the scra@@ p percentage by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % .
bone hist@@ ology In case of 152 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) , a year after the third adult dose of bone bi@@ op@@ sies were taken from the Beck@@ enk@@ amm .
a micro@@ computer system ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treated in comparison to placebo an increase of the tra@@ ins@@ ular bone @-@ volume and ob@@ taining the tra@@ ins@@ ular bone @-@ architecture .
bone mar@@ ker mar@@ ker The bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ terminal prop@@ ep@@ ti@@ d of Type @-@ I@@ - Coll@@ agen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in ser@@ um and the beta @-@ C @-@ T@@ elop@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in ser@@ um were determined in sub @-@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 246 patients in peri@@ odic intervals during the study period .
treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a reduced by 30 % compared to the initial basis and was held 28 % below the output value up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was reduced significantly by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 52 % below the output value up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was reduced significantly by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 55 % below the output value up to 36 months .
the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ in@@ ely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50.000 to 12@@ 5.000 I.@@ E. oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion .
the total mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a compared with 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ IZ@@ ON RF@@ T study increased the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treatment in comparison to placebo treatment the BM@@ D on the total surface and scra@@ ps of all time points .
the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treatment performed over 24 months compared to placebo treatment for an increase of the BM@@ D by 5.4 % on the total rate and 4,3 % of the total population .
clinical efficacy in males In the H@@ OR@@ IZ@@ ON RF@@ T study were random@@ ized 508 men and were evaluated at 185 patients the BM@@ D was evaluated after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical trials in men ; the frequency of clinical trials was 7.5 % in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a @-@ treated males compared to 8.@@ 7 % in placebo .
in another study in males ( study CZ@@ OL@@ 44@@ 6@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , an annual administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was referred to as compared to the once weekly change of lum@@ end@@ ron@@ at , based on the percentage change of lum@@ bar vor@@ tex @-@ BM@@ D after 24 months .
clinical efficacy of treatment at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was studied in patients and patients at the age over 30 years with radi@@ ological confir@@ m@@ suit ( mean ser@@ um mirror of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase correspon@@ d@@ ingly to 2.@@ 6@@ x to 3 @-@ fold @-@ specific upper normal value for inclusion in the study ) .
11 The effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ c acid in comparison to the intake of 30 mg ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at once daily for 2 months was demonstrated in two six months of comparison studies .
in the combined results , a similar decrease of pain intensity and pain @-@ influenced compar@@ ing for A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at was observed after 6 months .
patients who were classified as respon@@ ding at the end of the six month main study ( on the therapy ) could be recorded in a follow @-@ up phase .
from the 143 with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and 107 with the ris@@ ron of patients treated at the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic response was 141 with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , compared with 71 who treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at treated patients with a median duration of the follow @-@ up period of 18 months after application .
unique and multiple 5 and 15 minutes of in@@ fusion of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data that proved to be dos@@ is@@ independent .
after that , the plasma level increased rapidly to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long lasting phase , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value .
Siber@@ ian bi@@ ph@@ as@@ ic van@@ ishing from the great circulation of half times t ½ α 0,@@ 24 and t ½ hours 1,@@ 87 hours , followed by a long elim@@ ination phase with a terminal elim@@ ination cycle of ½ h 146 hours .
the early distribution phases ( α and white , with the af@@ ore@@ mentioned t ½ -@@ values ) will probably represent the rapid res@@ or@@ ption in the bone and the ex@@ cre@@ tion about the kidneys .
in the first 24 h 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose can be found in the urine , while the rest is mainly bound to bone tissue .
the total body @-@ Clear@@ ance is independent of the dose 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains un@@ affected by gender , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the in@@ fusion period from 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid concentration by 30 % at the end of in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plasma concentration against time ) .
a dimin@@ ished Clear@@ ance of the P@@ 450 @-@ En@@ z@@ ym@@ Systems met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed substances is unlikely , because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron &apos;s fo@@ lic acid is not met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed and because they require a weak or even no direct and / or ir@@ reversible , fuel @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 450@@ -
special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid cor@@ related with the cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance , and at the 64 examined patients in average 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) .
as a result , a slight ( cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and excessive kidney function up to a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ clearing up to 35 ml / min does not require any dose of dos@@ ing of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron .
for severe kidney problems ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only limited data are available , no statements are possible for this population .
acute tox@@ icity The highest non @-@ let@@ ed intraven@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg body weight in mice and rats 0.6 mg / kg body weight .

summary of the EP@@ AR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Be@@ dic@@ ation Report ( EP@@ AR ) , in which explains how the Committee for Human@@ ism ( CH@@ MP ) evalu@@ ates the studies carried out in order to obtain recommendations regarding the application of the medicine .
Ac@@ et@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . it can be applied solely on patients ( especially overweight patients ) . • It can be used together with another di@@ abe@@ tic medication ( al therapy ) .
in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially important patients ) can be applied in particular with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose .
in combination with a sul@@ fa drugs or insulin , the previous dose of sul@@ fa drugs may be retained , except for patients with hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; this should be reduced by the dose of sul@@ fa drugs or insulin .
this means that the body &apos;s own insulin can be utilized and blood sugar levels , thus reducing type 2 diabetes .
in more than 1 400 patients the effectiveness of Ac@@ et@@ tos in tri@@ ple@@ therapy was investigated ; in addition , patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with sul@@ fa drugs , in addition , they received either Ac@@ et@@ tos or placebo for up to 3.5 years .
in the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ co@@ y@@ li@@ zed hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) measured how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
Ac@@ et@@ tos resulted in a lower@@ ing of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which suggests that blood sugar levels were reduced by 15 mg , 30 mg , and 45 mg .
at the end of the Tri@@ ple@@ therapy study the effect of additional treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ fa drugs result in a lower@@ ing of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values increased by 0.@@ 94 % while the additional gift of placebo increased to a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study , in which the combination of Ac@@ et@@ tos and insulin was studied in 289 patients , the patients who Ac@@ et@@ tos increased from 0.@@ 69 % to 6 months , compared with 0.@@ 14 % in patients who took a placebo .
the most common adverse events related to Ac@@ et@@ tos were visual distur@@ ban@@ ces , infections of the upper respir@@ atory symptoms ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hy@@ al@@ es@@ thes@@ ia ( reduced sensitivity to irrit@@ ation ) .
Ac@@ et@@ tos may not be used for patients who may react sensiti@@ vely ( allergic ) to pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or one of the other components , even in patients with liver problems , con@@ gest@@ ive heart failure or di@@ abe@@ tic K@@ eto@@ azi@@ z ( high ket@@ on@@ ists - ac@@ id@@ spar - in the blood ) .
it has been decided that Ac@@ et@@ tos can serve as part of a mon@@ otherap@@ ist ( for all use ) as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients , where met@@ form@@ in is not displayed .
in October 2000 , the European Commission informed the company Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited for author@@ ization to run ac@@ tos in the whole European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whit@@ ish , round , curved and carry on one side the marking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 15 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ACT@@ OS . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is in@@ adequate and in which met@@ form@@ ations is in@@ adequate due to contra@@ indications or in@@ compatibility ( see section 4.4 ) .
for the use of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years no data is available , so the use in this age group is not recommended .
in patients suffering from the presence of at least one risk factor ( e.g. early heart attack or symp@@ tom@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start the treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose continuously .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of a heart failure , weight gain or eyel@@ ids , especially those with reduced cardi@@ ac reserve .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of a heart failure , weight gain and eyel@@ ids , if pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin .
a cardi@@ ov@@ ascular outlet with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and existing advanced macro@@ rov@@ ascular disease has been performed .
in this study , an increase in reports of con@@ gest@@ ive heart failure , which however did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with increased output liver disease ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on may not be used .
if the AL@@ T mirrors are increased to 3 times the upper limit of the standard range , Li@@ ver Enzy@@ mes are as soon as possible to control .
if a patient develops symptoms occurring on an oral dysfunction , such as un@@ solved nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , harmon@@ ic problems , fatigue , loss of appet@@ ite and / or dar@@ ker har@@ n , these are the liver disease values .
the decision whether the treatment of the patient with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on should be continued , should be guided by the laboratory parameters of clinical assessment .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , a dos@@ ing @-@ dependent weight gain was detected , which may lead to fat deposits and is related to some cases with fluid re@@ tention .
as a result of a ha@@ vo@@ cation at the therapy with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on a minor reduction in medium hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ings ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) .
similar changes were observed in compar@@ ative controlled trials with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ glob@@ alization around 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its around 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ ato@@ cr@@ its ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ ins around 1 @-@ 2 % ) and hem@@ ato@@ cr@@ its ( 1 @-@ 2 % ) .
as a result of increased insulin sensiti@@ v@@ ety in patients , the Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on as oral or triple combination therapy with insulin @-@ insulin or as two @-@ way combination therapy with insulin , the risk of dos@@ ing dependent hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ c@@ emia .
following the market launch , under the treatment of Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ces , including Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , on a occurrence or deteri@@ oration of a di@@ abe@@ tic mac@@ ular dem@@ a with a reduction in visual acu@@ ity .
it is un@@ clear whether there are direct connection between the intake of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and the occurrence of mac@@ ular dem@@ a , but patients should be aware of the possibility of a mac@@ ular dem@@ on , if patients should report on the visual acu@@ ity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ological examination should be considered .
in a summary of reports of adverse events in random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with over 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on were treated .
the calculated quest@@ ionnaire was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years , treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one women and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a compar@@ ative medication .
in the PRO@@ ACT@@ IVE study , a study over 3.5 years to the study of cardi@@ ov@@ ascular events , frac@@ tures were treated with 11 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients who were treated with a compar@@ ative medication .
patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy , and if a patient is pregnant or entering a pregnancy , the treatment is canc@@ eled ( see section 4.6 ) .
studies on the investigation of inter@@ actions showed that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on has no relevant effects on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
interaction with medicines that are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed from these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , calcium @-@ can@@ blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ as@@ em@@ mer are not expected to be expected .
the simultaneous use of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with the fibro@@ sis ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase of AU@@ C from Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on to increase the 3 times .
simultaneous use of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with R@@ if@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a reduction of AU@@ C from Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on by 54 % .
this is due to the treatment of hyper@@ ins@@ ul@@ in@@ emia and increased insulin @-@ resistance of the parent in pregnancy and thereby reduces the availability of met@@ abolic sub@@ str@@ ates to the federal state growth .
very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; often &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; &lt; 1 / 100 ; seldom &gt; 1 / 10000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , single cases : unknown ( from present data not estimated ) .
these lead to a temporary change of the engine and the index of the lens , as they are also observed in other hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic drugs .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , AL@@ T attacks on the triple and the upper limit of the norm range frequently occur equally as under placebo , but less commonly used in comparison of met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fa drugs .
in an outcome study in patients with existing advanced macro@@ rov@@ ascular disease the frequency of a severe heart failure under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was 1.6 % higher than under Plac@@ ebo when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or in the case .
since the market launch , rarely exceeds the heart failure under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , however , more often if Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was used in combination with insulin or patients with heart failure in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese .
a summary of reports of adverse events in random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with over 8,@@ 100 patients treated in treated groups and over 7,@@ 400 patients treated with compar@@ ative medication treated groups .
over a period of 3.5 years of the PRO@@ ACT@@ IVE study , frac@@ tures came to 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one patients treated with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients who were treated with a compar@@ ative medication .
taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days were no symptoms .
Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on seems to work on a activation of specific core recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ation ) Rec@@ ept@@ or @-@ γ ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ g ) ) which leads to an elevated insulin @-@ sensitive treatment of liver , fat and skel@@ eton muscle cells .
it could be shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduces the glucose production in the liver and increases the peripher@@ al glucose levels in case of insulin resistant .
a clinical study with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d as a mon@@ otherap@@ eutic was continued over two years to investig@@ ate the time of the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 treatment months ) .
at the time after two years after the therapy , a blood sugar monitoring ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) was maintained by Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on at 69 % of the patients treated ( over 50 % of patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was in@@ adequ@@ ately adjusted to insulin or placebo was random@@ ized to Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or placebo .
in patients under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduced the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c - value to 0.@@ 45 % , compared to the patients who continue to receive insulin . a reduction of insulin treatment in the treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on was observed .
clinical trials over a year showed a statist@@ ically significant decline of the Alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Qu@@ oti@@ ants compared to the bas@@ eline values .
the effect of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was evaluated in a small , 18 @-@ week study of type 2 di@@ abe@@ tics .
in most clinical studies , a reduction in the plasma tri@@ gly@@ ceri@@ des and free fatty acids and a rise in HD@@ L@@ - Chol@@ ester@@ in@@ spiegel , as well as minor , but clin@@ ically significant increased LD@@ L@@ - Chol@@ ester@@ in@@ spiegel .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduced the overall plas@@ mat@@ ri@@ gly@@ ceri@@ de and the free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L cholesterol .
in comparison to Plaz@@ ebo found no statist@@ ically significant increase in LD@@ L cholesterol , while under met@@ form@@ in and lic@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d were observed .
in a study over 20 weeks , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on not only reduced the cau@@ stic tri@@ gly@@ ceri@@ des , but also improved tri@@ gly@@ ceri@@ de levels in addition to the tri@@ gly@@ ceri@@ de absorption , as well as on the tri@@ gly@@ ceri@@ des of tri@@ gly@@ ceri@@ de synthesis .
in the PRO@@ ACT@@ IVE study , a cardi@@ ov@@ ascular disease study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and existing advanced macro@@ rov@@ ascular disease were random@@ ised in groups over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing anti@@ di@@ abe@@ tic and cardi@@ ov@@ ascular therapy in either Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or placebo .
after oral application , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is absorbed quickly , with the peak concentrations of un@@ altered pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in the plasma normally takes 2 hours after use .
on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV represents the efficacy in roughly the thre@@ e@@ fold of the efficacy of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative efficacy of M @-@ II is minimal .
in intervention trials demonstrated that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on has no relevant effect on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .

according to oral use of radio@@ active mark@@ zed Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in humans the mar@@ ker was found mainly in the case ( 55 % ) and a lower extent in the urine ( 45 % ) .
the mean plasma @-@ elim@@ ination time of un@@ altered Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is 5 @-@ 6 hours , and all the active met@@ abolic rate is 16 - 23 hours .
the plasma cent@@ ri@@ cul@@ ations of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and its metabol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced ren@@ al function than with healthy volunteers , but the install@@ ments of the oral Clear@@ ance of the parent are re@@ semble itself .

Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane was diagnosed in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes , where the pan@@ cre@@ as can not produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes , in which the body is not able to use insulin effectively .
in the study , after 12 weeks the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ co@@ li@@ zed hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured as well as the blood sugar is adjusted .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane resulted in a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror that suggests that blood sugar levels were similar to another human@@ ities .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients that may react sensiti@@ vely ( allergic ) to human ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
in addition , doses of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane may need to be adjusted , if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood sugar ( the full list is to remove the pack@@ ag@@ age ) .
the Committee on Human@@ ity agents ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane are conce@@ aled in the treatment of diabetes by the risks involved .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for author@@ ization to manage ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the whole European Union .
mixed insulin products are usually used once or twice daily when a fast initial effect is desired together with a longer lasting effect .
the injection needle must be bel@@ low under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose was inj@@ ected .
patients whose blood sugar is significantly improved by a intensi@@ fied insulin therapy , the hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ ca@@ emia warning symptoms can be perceived and should be advised accordingly .
any change in strength , brand ( manufacturers ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ ph@@ as@@ ic , long acting insulin ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human@@ insulin or insulin ) and / or manufacturing method ( via re@@ combin@@ ant DNA in animal origin ) may lead to a change of dosage .
if the change to Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane is necessary in patients with dos@@ is@@ ph@@ ane , it can be necessary for the first dose or during the first weeks or months after the conversion .
some patients , during which hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions came up after a change of animal insulin , reported that the early warning symptoms of hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ ca@@ emia were less pronounced than in their previous insulin .
before travelling , which go over several time zones , the patient should be pointed out to bring the advice of his doctor , as such trips can be taken , taken and taken for meals at other times .
therefore , the doctor must take possible inter@@ actions in the therapy and in@@ quire in his patients with other medicines .

hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ ca@@ emia can develop continuously , however : • Easy hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ n@@ ics can be treated by oral intake of glucose and sugar or sugar food .
di@@ abe@@ tics should therefore always have grape crop , swe@@ ets , biscuits , or sugar @-@ juice . they are treated with in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by a proven assistant or by glucose which will be intraven@@ ously due to the doctor .
the effect begins within half an hour , the maximum maximum length is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the entire duration of the duration is up to 24 hours .
the Res@@ or@@ ption profile is based on this product , that it is a mixture of insulin products with faster or delayed res@@ or@@ ption .
a number of spl@@ end@@ or ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) places on the human ins@@ ul@@ in@@ molec@@ ule were moved in weak@@ ened ; none of the met@@ abolic of the metabolism is active .

this document is a summary of the European Public Be@@ dic@@ ation Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee on Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) has assessed the studies carried out in order to obtain recommendations regarding the application of the medicine .
the practical effective component in Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id , insulin @-@ human ( r@@ DNA ) , is produced using the procedure of so @-@ called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant technology &quot; :

Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id should not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
in addition , the doses of acet@@ tra@@ p@@ id may need to be adjusted , if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S with author@@ ization for the transport of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the entire European Union .
if two types of insulin are shu@@ ff@@ led , first , the amount of the fast @-@ acting insulin must be applied , then the amount of the long @-@ acting insulin .
3 If the change to Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id is necessary in the patient a dose permit is necessary , it may be necessary for the first dose or during the first weeks or months after the conversion .
before travelling , which go over several time zones , the patient should be pointed out to bring the advice of his doctor , as such trips can be taken , taken and taken for meals at other times .
5 general diseases and complaints in the scope of performance - local hyper@@ sensitivity to the injection site During insulin therapy , local hyper@@ sensitivity can occur ( redness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and hem@@ at@@ oma at the injection site ) .

aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients who already exhibit the signs of cryst@@ all@@ ment@@ ations , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or shift no@@ des ( &quot; stones &quot; ) . larger urine deposits that can lead to joint and bone damages .
if the ureth@@ ra is still more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ ite , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day .
during the first treatment months , patients still can occur ; therefore , it is recommended that the patients take at least during the first six months under treatment with Aden@@ ur@@ ic to take further medicines to prevent gas loss .
the medicine is not recommended in children and in patients who had an organ transplan@@ tation , as it was not investigated for these groups .
in the first study , on which 1 0@@ 72 patients participated , the effectiveness of three different Aden@@ ur@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with a placebo ( medical drug regim@@ ents ) and Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ ine ( another drug for treating hyper@@ ur@@ ik@@ emia ) .
in the second study , two doses of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ ine .
in both studies Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ ine was used in a dose of once daily 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
main indi@@ ces for the effectiveness was the number of patients whose ure@@ tic tiles was in the blood at the last three measurements under 6 mg / dl .
in the first study , 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) of patients who purchased Aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg of patients , and 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) of patients who were once daily 120 mg , with the last three measurements a ure@@ tic tiles in the blood of below 6 mg / dl .
in comparison with this , this was 22 % ( 60 out of 268 ) of the patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ ine and none of the 134 patients under placebo .
the most common adverse events of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rhe@@ a , nau@@ sea ( Nau@@ sea ) , r@@ ash and abnormal liver values .
especially in patients with heart problems , possibly an increased risk of certain side effects may affect the heart and blood vessels .
the committee for human dental agents ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in the lower@@ ing of the ureth@@ ra , but also a higher risk of side effects in connection with the heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic Hyper@@ ur@@ ik@@ emia in cases of disease which have already led to urine deposits ( including one from the health history known or present ) ( or a G@@ Gas@@ ket ) .
for 2 @-@ 4 weeks , the Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ acid protection still amounts to &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , can be considered a dose increase to AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily .
patients with severe kidney function have not been completely examined ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see section 5.2 ) .
children and teen@@ agers , since there are no experiences with children and adolescents , the use of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at in this patient group is not recommended .
Organ@@ transplan@@ t Da es have no experiences with Organ@@ iz@@ buch , the use of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at in this patient group is not recommended ( see section 5.1 ) .
cardi@@ ov@@ ascular diseases For patients with isch@@ ar@@ ic heart disease or dec@@ im@@ ated heart failure ( see section 4.8 ) is not recommended ( see section 4.8 ) .
as with other har@@ n@@ aci@@ di@@ fying drugs , it can occur during treatment to a acute g@@ utter attack because of the lower@@ ing of the Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ acid temperature to be mobili@@ zed in the tissue .
B. for mal@@ ign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han syndrome ) the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases is so far increasing that it comes to a shift in the ur@@ inary tract .
liver disease During the phase 3 clinical trials , slight ab@@ normal@@ ities of the liver function were observed with Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at treated patients ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to perform a liver function test before the beginning of the Feb@@ u@@ pf@@ ront treatment and in the course of clinical findings ( see section 5.1 ) .
The@@ ophy@@ l@@ line Z@@ was performed no interaction studies on Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O inhibit@@ ing can lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line reflection ( a in@@ hibition of the metabolism of the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) .
for subjects the simultaneous treatment of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at and Nap@@ ro@@ xen 250 mg 2 x daily was associated with a rise in the Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at@@ op ( C@@ max 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) .
in clinical studies , the use of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors were not related to a clin@@ ically significant increase of adverse events .

in a study involving human subjects , 120 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 1 x daily an average 22 % increase in AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine , a CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strate , which indicates a possible weak hom@@ eli@@ or@@ ic effect of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at to the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ enzyme in vivo .
Ant@@ acids It could be shown that the simultaneous taking of an ant@@ acids , magnesium hydro@@ x@@ ide and aluminum hydro@@ x@@ ide , was delayed by Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( about 1 hour ) and a reduction in the C@@ max by 32 % , but no significant change in AU@@ C causes .
pregnancy data on a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ ancies do not leave any side effects of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at to pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ bor@@ ns .
experimental studies do not depend on direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see section 5.3 ) .
patients should be careful when purchasing a vehicle , use of machines or when exercising dangerous activities , except they may be certain that AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC will not affect their performance .
a paid higher incidence of cardi@@ ov@@ ascular events was observed in the P@@ iv@@ ot@@ al study of Phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.3 events per 100 patient years ) , although no statist@@ ically significant differences were found and no caus@@ al connection with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at could be detected .
the risk factors in these patients were an arter@@ ios@@ kl@@ erotic disease and / or a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction or a de@@ comp@@ uted heart failure in medical history .
frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , random ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) adverse events , which could be associated with the medicine and reported in all Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at treatment groups a total of more than once were listed below .
diar@@ rhe@@ a , nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients who are treated simultaneously with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in . * * In clinical trials , no severe skin fail@@ ures or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed .
7 Open @-@ time renewal studies in the open long @-@ term renewal studies were treated for up to 1 year long , 322 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients and 53 patients for up to 4 years with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg .
the events reported during the long @-@ term renewal studies were similar to those described in Phase 3 studies ( see table 1 ) .
the following treatment @-@ related events were reported in all Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at@@ - treatment groups a total of more than once and appeared in patients who received Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term renewal studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1.@@ 900 patients ) , according to the indications occasionally .

clinical study results The efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was performed in two P@@ iv@@ ot@@ al studies of phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) that were carried out with 1.@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ a@@ ic@@ emia and g@@ out .
the primary efficacy of the patient was in every study the proportion of patients in which the last three months had given a specific ser@@ um of &lt; 6,0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 7 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 135 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 10 ) for patients with a ser@@ um incre@@ at@@ ine value at the beginning of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl .
the AP@@ EX study showed the statist@@ ically significant su@@ peri@@ ority of 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) ( see table 2 and Figure 1 ) , as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily with the normal used doses Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 258 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .

the lower@@ ing of the Ser@@ um@@ har@@ ac@@ id@@ spar at &lt; 6,0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the doctor &apos;s visit in week 2 and permanently maintain the entire treatment .
509 patients received al@@ lo@@ pur@@ ine , 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with ser@@ um atoms &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ren@@ al @-@ functional limitations The AP@@ EX study evaluated the effectiveness in 40 patients with kidney function .
with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC the primary efficacy end@@ point was 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients .
there weren &apos;t any clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage of the ser@@ um @-@ acid concentrations of subjects , regardless of their ren@@ al function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney disease ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ser@@ um @-@ acid concentrations of 10 mg / dl gain about 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and F@@ ACT study ) had a ser@@ um concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
the data collected in two years collected data from the open renewal study at &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , a decrease of the incidence of up to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) required a decrease of the in@@ shift in the months 16 @-@ 24 ( i.e. more than 97 % of the patients needed no treatment against a shift ) .
this was associated with a reduction of the layer no@@ d@@ gment size , which 54 % of patients had a complete dis@@ appearance of the G@@ shift node up to the month 24 .
increased T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received long @-@ term treatment with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients who received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ ine ( 5.8 % ) in the open long @-@ term renewal studies ( see Section 4.4 ) .
for healthy volunteers , the maximum plasma cent@@ ri@@ cul@@ ations ( C@@ max ) and the area under the Plas@@ ma@@ on@@ centr@@ ations @-@ Time curve ( AU@@ C ) of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at increased simpler and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ is@@ proportional .
for doses ranging between 120 mg and 300 mg , an increase in AU@@ C is observed , which is greater than the dos@@ is@@ proportional increase .
after taking easier or multi@@ mod@@ al doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the c@@ max is approximately 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µ@@ g / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant change was observed in the percentage decrease of the ser@@ um concentration levels ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent Ste@@ ady state distribution volume ( V@@ SS / F ) of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at lies in the range from 29 to 75 l after intake of doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease in which the bones are qu@@ ashed ) in women after men@@ opause , where there is a risk of a low vitamin D mirror .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drink or use other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) .
in order to avoid irrit@@ ation of the o@@ es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient may take up until after the first food intake of the day , which should be no earlier than 30 minutes after intake of the tablet .
since Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at and Vitamin D3 are already used separately in pharmac@@ euticals , which are approved in the European Union , the company had data to date from previous studies and published literature .
the company also conducted a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post @-@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to prove the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in relation to the increase in vitamin D reflec@@ tions .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels were treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 11 % ) than those who were only al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( 32 % ) .
moreover , the company also laid data on which the Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is exactly the dose that is required for preventing bone loss .
the most common adverse events ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of the motion apparatus ( muscles , bone or joints ) and symptoms of the digest@@ ion apparatus such as abdominal pain , dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ia ( swal@@ lowing disorders ) , o@@ ops ( swal@@ lowing disorders ) , dra@@ ined abdom@@ en ( blind@@ ed abdominal pain ) and suction .
for patients with any sensitivity to Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at , vitamin D3 or one of the other components , AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE can not be applied .
it must not be used in cases of es@@ oph@@ agus , in patients with Hy@@ po@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium level ) or in patients who can not stand or sit for at least 30 minutes .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day .
the following references are to be followed precisely to reduce the risk of ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation and associated side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be swallowed by a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) . • The patients should not che@@ w the tablet or leave the tablet in the mouth , as a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al Ul@@ zer@@ a . • The patients should not take place before taking the tablet at the earliest 30 minutes after intake of the tablet .
B. p@@ ep@@ tic ul@@ cer , active gast@@ ro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical procedures in the upper Gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract except P@@ yl@@ or@@ oplast@@ y , can only be given under special caution ( see section 4.3 ) .
Ö@@ sop@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ ag@@ itis , gn@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al cho@@ col@@ ates , rare followed by ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al stri@@ k@@ tures , were reported in patients under the intake of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( partly these are severe and required a hospital order ) .
therefore , the doctor should take attention to all the signs and symptoms that are pointed out to possible solutions , such as dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ia , pain in swal@@ lowing or retro@@ f@@ ern@@ al pain , or new or wor@@ ris@@ ed so@@ d@@ burn the medicine and get medical advice ( see section 4.8 ) .
3 The risk of severe her@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects seems to be increased in patients that do not occupy the drug correctly and / or after the appearance of symptoms which point to a ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation , continue to take .
it is very important that all doses are passed on to the patient and understood in the patient ( see Section 4.2 ) .
while in large clinical trials with al@@ end@@ ron@@ at , no higher risk was observed , seldom ( after the market launch ) Mag@@ en- and Du@@ o@@ den@@ al@@ ul@@ zer@@ a were rare ( according to the market introduction ) Mag@@ - and Du@@ o@@ den@@ al@@ ul@@ zer@@ a , including some severe and complications of complications ( see section 4.8 ) .

there is no data available , the clu@@ es indicate whether the use of a bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ at@@ ric therapy in patients who need an or@@ rh@@ age surgical procedure reduces the risk of an oste@@ on@@ ry of pine .
the clinical assessment of the doctor &apos;s treated doctor is crucial for all patients on the basis of an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients will need to be instructed when taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE to take the tablet in the next morning after they have noticed their fail@@ ures .
you should not take two tablets at the same day , but taking the intake of one tablet per week as originally planned for the week day .
other diseases that affect the mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ o@@ idi@@ os@@ us ) should also be treated at the beginning of the therapy with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
al@@ end@@ ron@@ at foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines may affect the res@@ or@@ ption of al@@ end@@ ron@@ at if they are taken at the same time .
therefore patients need to wait at least 30 minutes after taking Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at before taking other medicines ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interaction studies were not performed , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was taken together with a multitude of usually prescribed medicines , without clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended only for use in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore neither applied during pregnancy nor by l@@ act@@ ating women .
animal studies with al@@ end@@ ron@@ at leave no clu@@ e directly to the pregnancy , to detect the embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
oste@@ on@@ em@@ rose of the jaw was reported in patients under bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ; most reports originate from cancer patients , but was also reported in oste@@ opor@@ osis .

in oste@@ opor@@ osis , al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day .
in healthy volunteers the gift of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times daily ) lead to no clin@@ ically significant change of oral bio@@ availability of al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( increase in average in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) .
9 Distribution Studies in rats revealed that Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at is temporarily distributed after intraven@@ ous gift of 1 mg / kg , but then rapidly disper@@ sed into the bones or dischar@@ ged with the urine .
ex@@ cre@@ tion According to the intraven@@ ous gift of a single dose of 14@@ C @-@ Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at about 50 % of the radio@@ active substances marked within 72 hours with the urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the cases .

main indi@@ ces of the effectiveness was the number of patients with which the transplan@@ t was reduced from a year ( by example , how often a new transplan@@ tation or res@@ um@@ ption of di@@ aly@@ sis was required ) .
in addition , recent further studies of 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation and 129 patients were performed with liver transplan@@ tation and analysed , like Ad@@ vag@@ raf in comparison to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft of the body .

only doctors that are familiar with immun@@ os@@ u@@ sive therapy and treatment of transplan@@ ts should make this medicine re@@ arrange or make changes in the immun@@ os@@ u@@ sive therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences of system@@ ic exposure of T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus , this can lead to transplan@@ tation or to an increased incidence of side effects , including sub @-@ drug ad@@ re@@ pression .
patients always should maintain the same T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus form@@ ulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; modification of the form@@ ulation or the regime should be performed only under the eng@@ aging control of an experienced physician ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
in consequence of a switch to an alternative form@@ ulation , a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dos@@ is@@ iz@@ ations must be carried out to ensure that system@@ ic exposure of T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus is maintained .
the dose of Ad@@ vag@@ raf should be primarily based on the clinical assessment of rep@@ ul@@ sion and toler@@ ability in individual cases ( see below &quot; Recommend@@ ations
after conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Ad@@ vag@@ raf , the T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus basin should be controlled before the conversion and over two weeks after switching .
on Day 4 , system@@ ic exposure was measured as a valley mirror with both form@@ ulations both in kidney or liver transplan@@ t patients .
careful and repeated controls of the T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus level mirror are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation under Ad@@ vag@@ raf to ensure appropriate substance @-@ exposure in immediate after@@ transplan@@ tation phase .
because T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus is a substance with low Clear@@ ance , an adaptation of the additi@@ raf @-@ dos@@ ing schem@@ as can take several days until the Ste@@ ady State is reached .
if the patient allows no oral in@@ fusion of medicines in the first post @-@ operative phase , the T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus Treatment is administered intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate to produce an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca .
in order to supp@@ ression the transplan@@ tation of transplan@@ tation , the immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ression must be maintained ; consequently a maximum length of oral therapy cannot be stated .
recommended Dos@@ is@@ recommendation - kidney transplan@@ t proph@@ yla@@ xis of transplan@@ t drugs The oral adhes@@ ion therapy should begin with 0,@@ 20 - 0,@@ 30 mg / kg / day as once daily gift the morning .
further dos@@ is@@ iz@@ ations can later be necessary , as the Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus can change in the course of stabili@@ zing patients after transplan@@ tation .
recommended Dos@@ is@@ recommendation - liver transplan@@ t proph@@ yla@@ xis of transplan@@ t drugs The oral adhes@@ ion therapy should begin with 0,@@ 10 - 0,@@ 20 mg / kg / day as once daily gift the morning .
recommended Dos@@ age recommendation - conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Ad@@ vag@@ raf must be changed by daily dosage of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules to a once daily intake of Ad@@ vag@@ raf , so this change@@ over to take place in ratio 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) to take place on the entire daily dose .
kidney disease and liver transplan@@ tation after a change@@ over from other immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ress@@ ants on Ad@@ vag@@ inas one day must start the treatment with the recommended initi@@ als recommended in kidney disease and liver transplan@@ t dose for proph@@ yla@@ xis of the transplan@@ tation .
heart transplan@@ tation in adult patients who will be addressed to Ad@@ vag@@ raf is an oral initial dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day once daily taken in the morning .
other gra@@ fts , although there are no clinical experience with Ad@@ vag@@ raf in lung , pan@@ cre@@ as and dar@@ ed transplan@@ t patients in an oral initi@@ ation of 0.2 mg / kg / day and on intestinal transplan@@ t intake of 0.2 mg / kg / day and on intestinal transplan@@ t intake of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dos@@ is@@ iz@@ ations in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function for maintaining blood mirror in the targeted range can be necessary in patients with severe liver function disorders .
patients with reduced ren@@ al function Since the kidney function ex@@ er@@ ts no influence on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus , it can be assumed that a dose adaptation is not required .
due to the ne@@ phr@@ otic potential of T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus , however , careful monitoring of ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of the ser@@ um incre@@ at@@ in@@ spiegel , a calculation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine and a monitoring of urea volume ) is recommended .
conversion from Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in on Ad@@ vag@@ raf during the conversion from a Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy is advis@@ able ( see sections 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations on the mirror in full blood The dose should be primarily based on the clinical assessment of shock @-@ shock and toler@@ ability in individual case by thorou@@ gh@@ bred T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus @-@ Tal@@ ks controls .
it is recommended to perform frequent checks of the T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus valley levels during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation , followed by peri@@ odic inspec@@ tions during maintenance therapy .
blood @-@ level mirror of T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus should also be changed after the conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Ad@@ vag@@ raf , dos@@ ing adap@@ tion , changes of immun@@ os@@ u@@ sive therapy or in the same application of substances which could change the T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus whole blood concentrations ( see section 4.5 ) .
since Ad@@ vag@@ raf is a drug with a low Clear@@ ance , adap@@ t@@ ations of the dose may need several days until the Ste@@ ady State has occurred .
the data in clinical studies indicate that a successful treatment is possible in most cases when the blood levels not exceed 20 n@@ g / ml .
in clinical practice the valley levels of T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus are generally found in the first time after liver transplan@@ tation in the first time after liver transplan@@ tation in the range of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and in gl@@ ands and heart transplan@@ t patients at 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml .
in general blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 n@@ g / ml were used during subsequent conservation of liver , kidney disease and cardi@@ ac transplan@@ tation .
this led to severe undes@@ ired events , including transplan@@ tation or other side effects , which can occur in a result of t@@ acro@@ li@@ mus or over@@ lays .
patients should always maintain the same T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus form@@ ulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; modification of the form@@ ulation or the regime should be performed only under the eng@@ aging control of an experienced physician ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
5 For the treatment of adult patients with transplan@@ tation , which proved to other immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ress@@ ants as therapy @-@ resistant , no clinical data for ret@@ arded wording Ad@@ vag@@ raf left .
in the childhood proph@@ yla@@ xis of the transplan@@ t with adult heart transplan@@ t and transplan@@ tation in the child &apos;s age are not yet clinical data for ret@@ arded wording Ad@@ vag@@ raf .
because of possible interaction effects , which can lead to a reduction of t@@ acro@@ li@@ mus in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of t@@ acro@@ li@@ mus , is the intake of herbal supplements ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) , or other herbal remedies during treatment with ad@@ mira@@ raf ( see section 4.5 ) .
in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus are offered in the blood , as the T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus weight levels can be subject to considerable variations in such circumstances .
in rare cases , a chamber or sep@@ tic hyper@@ tro@@ phy was observed under Pro@@ gra@@ f , which can therefore also occur under Ad@@ vag@@ raf .
other factors enh@@ ancing the risk of such clinical disorders , are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ ost@@ ero@@ ids , hypertension , kidney or liver function , infections , liquid strain and oil .
like in other immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ress@@ ants , exposure to sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to suitable clothing or use of a solar control using a high protection factor .
when patients who take T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus , symptoms for Pre@@ s such as head@@ aches , changing levels of consciousness , cr@@ amping and t@@ end@@ ows should indicate a radi@@ ographic examination ( e.@@ g .

simultaneous use of medicines or herbal medicines that are known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P3@@ A4 , can affect or lower the metabolism of T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus , or reducing blood values by T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus .
it is therefore advis@@ able to monitor the T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus weight levels in the same gift of substances that can change the CY@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and adjust the T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus dose for maintaining constant levels ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strongly pronounced interaction effect was used with An@@ tim@@ y@@ cot@@ ic such as K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and vor@@ icon@@ az@@ ole as well as with the Macro@@ lid @-@ antibiot@@ ic er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z ) .
Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics studies resulted in increasing blood levels mainly from the elevated oral bio@@ availability of T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus , due to the in@@ hibition of gast@@ ro@@ intestinal pollution .
high @-@ dose pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on , as it is used in acute degra@@ dation transactions , can increase or lower concentration of t@@ acro@@ li@@ mus in the blood .
the effect of T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus on the metabolism of other drug T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus is known as the CY@@ P3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or ; therefore , the simultaneous application of t@@ acro@@ li@@ mus with medicines , which are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by CY@@ P3@@ A4 , can affect the metabolism .
because T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus can come down the Clear@@ ance of ster@@ oid @-@ contrac@@ ep@@ tives and thus increase the hormone levels , is particularly careful with the decisions about receiving sensitive measures .
the results of animal experiments have shown that T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus potentially reduce the clearing of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ on and pro@@ long their half time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the results of a low number of exam@@ inations on transplan@@ tation we provide no indication that under T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus , in comparison to other immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ress@@ ants , an increased risk of adverse events is related to the course and result of pregnancy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in u@@ ter@@ o exposure , monitoring of new@@ bor@@ ns is recommended to any harmful effects of T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus ( in particular regarding its effect on the kidneys ) .
there is a risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ a@@ emia of the new@@ born ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns ) , i.e. :
due to the atro@@ phy of the patient and the simultaneous treatment of a variety of other medicines , immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ress@@ ants is often not accurate .

infections and paras@@ itic diseases How well @-@ known in other highly efficient immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ress@@ ants can be treated with T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus , the vulner@@ ability for infections ( viral , bacterial , my@@ cot@@ ic , prot@@ o@@ zo@@ ale ) frequently increased .
cases of BK @-@ virus @-@ associated N@@ eph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C virus @-@ associated progressive multi@@ focal leu@@ ko@@ en@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients under immun@@ o@@ deficiency therapy , including therapy with ad@@ mira@@ raf .
it was reported about ben@@ ign or mal@@ ign@@ ant ne@@ op@@ las@@ men including EB@@ V@@ - associated lympho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tum@@ ours associated with T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus .
because of its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ ub@@ ility and high bonds to er@@ y@@ thro@@ cytes and plasma samples can be assumed that T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus is not di@@ aly@@ able .
mechanism of action and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects on molecular level will be convey@@ ed by the effects of T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus through its li@@ aison to a cy@@ tos@@ ol@@ ic protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for enri@@ ching the connection in the cell inside .
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um dependent inhibit@@ ing of signal trans@@ duc@@ ed because of the T cell and prevents the tran@@ scription of a certain series of lympho@@ kin genes .

Adv@@ ance is used to treat and prevention of bleeding in patients with ha@@ em@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A ( a hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ulation disorder ) caused by the lack of factor VIII .
the dosage and frequency of the application will be al@@ igned to apply for the treatment of bleeding or to prevent bleeding in surgical procedures .
patients with ha@@ em@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency , causing blood cl@@ ots such as bleeding in joints , muscles or internal organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but according to a method described as &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology &quot; :
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which it enables to facilitate the formation of the human cl@@ utter factor VIII .
Adv@@ ancement is similar to another in the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but it is different , so that the medicine contains no proteins of human or animal origin .
in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate h@@ is@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A , including a study with 53 children under six years , the application of the drug was investigated prior to prevention of bleeding and in surgical procedures .
in the main study the efficacy of adv@@ ances in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 510 % has been awarded with &quot; excellent &quot; or &quot; good . &quot;
the most common adverse events of Adv@@ ices ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ aches , py@@ re@@ x@@ ie ( fever ) and the formation of anti@@ bodies over factor VIII .
Adv@@ ices must not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against human cl@@ ot@@ ating factor VIII , mouse or ham@@ ster@@ protein or any of other components .
in March 2004 , the European Commission adopted B@@ ax@@ ter AG for author@@ ization of Adv@@ ance in the entire European Union .
dosage : the dose and duration of the subject line therapy is directed by the sever@@ ity of the factor VIII @-@ deficiency , after the place and the degree of blood and the clinical condition of the patient .
for the following hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic events , the factor VIII activity should not fall under the stated plasma level ( in % of the standard or in I.@@ U. / dl ) .
injection all 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer repeat until the pain and acute imp@@ air@@ ment has been removed .
injection all 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat until the danger is over for the patient .
during treatment of treatment , the dose and frequency of injec@@ tions administered appropriate determination of the factor VIII @-@ Plas@@ mas@@ pie@@ gel .
individual patients may differ in response to factor VIII , different in vivo recovery and have different half times .
3 proph@@ yla@@ xis In the long @-@ term proph@@ yla@@ xis of patients with severe hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 i.@@ E. by factor VIII per kg body weight in a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VIII @-@ plasma activity is not achieved or when the bleeding is not controlled with a reasonable dose , a test must be performed to prove a inhibit@@ or .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors , it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective , so other therapeutic measures must be considered .
the expected speed should be determined according to the patient , whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
formation of neutral anti@@ bodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with ha@@ em@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always against the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VIII caused Ig@@ G immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins which are qu@@ anti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml Plasma by modi@@ fying Beth@@ es@@ da As@@ say .
the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors , cor@@ related to the extent of exposure to the factor VIII , where the risk within the first 20 exposure days is on the biggest and genetic and other factors .
in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 re@@ positioning and an@@ am@@ ne@@ tically known influ@@ enza product was observed , after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII product to another that re@@ appeared from ( lowest ) inhibit@@ ors .
due to the rare occurrence of hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A in women there are no experiences about the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and lac@@ tation .
the patients , occurring in the largest number of patients , were inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) , which exhibit a higher risk to the formation of inhibit@@ ors , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , sometimes ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( frequency based on available data is not estimated ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated using the sum of the individual patients ( 234 ) ) The unexpected drop of blood cl@@ ot@@ ating factor VIII ( 10 - 14 post@@ oper@@ atively day ) during a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ ATE in@@ fusion .
the blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained during the whole period and both the factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - mirrors in the plasma as well as the Clear@@ ance Rate showed sufficient values on the 15 postoperative day .
in clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ ATE to 145 children and adults 2 with diagnostics ( ≥ 150 days ) and previous exposure to the factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - concentrations ( ≥ 150 days ) showed a low inhibit@@ ors ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in modified Beth@@ es@@ da approach ) .
in addition , none of the 53 p@@ ä@@ di@@ at@@ ric patients with an age of less than 6 years and diagnosed with severe hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) after previous exposure to factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - concentrations ( ≥ 50 days ) a F@@ VIII inhibit@@ or was noted .
previously untreated patients of a current clinical study formed 5 of 25 ( 20 % ) treated with A@@ DV@@ ATE patients treated against factor VIII .
the immune response of the patients on traces of contam@@ inated proteins was analyzed by investig@@ ating anti @-@ antibody tit@@ res against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects .
a patient showed both a statist@@ ically significant upward trend towards anti @-@ Ch@@ o cell protein , but otherwise no signs or symptoms occurred which referred to an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity .
in four patients the occurrence of Ur@@ tik@@ aria , Pr@@ ur@@ itus , r@@ ur@@ itus , r@@ ash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ op@@ hil@@ es were reported in several repet@@ itive products items in the study .
7 How with other intraven@@ ous products , A@@ DV@@ ATE has been reported on hyper@@ sensitivity reactions from the allergic type , including an@@ aphy@@ lac@@ tic / an@@ aphy@@ lac@@ tic reactions ( frequency not known ) .
the activated factor VIII acts as a factor for the activated factor IX and acceler@@ ates the formation of activated factor X by factor X .
all Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ DV@@ ATE were performed on previously treated patients with severe or moderate h@@ is@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A ( base value of the factor VIII activity ≤ 2 % ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters come from a cross @-@ over study with A@@ DV@@ ATE in 100 previously treated patients or &gt; 10 years and are listed in table 3 below .

each single package consists of a pier@@ cing bottle containing 5 ml solvent ( both glass type I with chlor@@ ob@@ ut@@ yl rubber boots ) and a device for re@@ construc@@ ting ( BA@@ X@@ J@@ ECT II ) .
if the product is still stored in the refrigerator , remove all feed bottles with A@@ DV@@ ATE powder and solvents from the fridge and heat at room temperature ( between 15 and 25 ° C ) .
a significant increase in the pulse rate can usually be reduced immediately by slow@@ ing or temporary inter@@ ruption of injection ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .

based on the data available since the initial approval , CH@@ MP has still considered a positive rating , but considering that the safety profile must be closely monitored from the following reasons :
therefore , CH@@ MP is based on the basis of the security field of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which makes an entry of P@@ SU@@ R@@ s every 6 months required , that the authorisation holder should apply for 5 years a further extension procedure .
in December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Molecular Limited was officially distributed to the Committee on Human@@ ity agents ( CH@@ MP ) , that the company rec@@ alls its application for approval of Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
however , the breast , the brain , the bones or the soft tissues ( tissues which connects the other structures in the body ) are affected .
this is a kind of virus that has been gene@@ tically modified so that it can carry a gene in the cells of the body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Aden@@ ov@@ irus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which has been modified so that there is no copies of itself and therefore no infections can trigger for people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Adv@@ ex@@ in could have inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ours and thus enable the cancer cells to re @-@ form the normal p@@ 53 protein .
the p@@ 53 protein that is formed from the non @-@ defect in the human body of the p@@ 53 gene , normally contributes to the restoration of damage DNA and to kill the cells when DNA cannot be recovered .
at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells continue to grow and share .
the company presented data from a study involving a patient , with the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer , in the field of under@@ mining , in bone and brain .
after the CH@@ MP tested the company &apos;s answers to the questions , some questions were un@@ solved .
based on the initial documents , CH@@ MP has created a list of questions which will be sent to the company by day 120 .
according to CH@@ MP opinion , the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i tum@@ ors is not proven to bring benefits to the patient .
the Committee also had concerns relating to the processing of the drug in the body , the type of administration and safety of the drug .
in addition , the company had not proven sufficiently to be established in a reliable manner and that it is neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the company did not inform the CH@@ MP , whether the withdrawal are consequences for patients currently taking part in clinical trials or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Comp@@ as@@ sion@@ ate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed active release &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that the tablets are so composed that one of the effective components is immediately released and the other is slowly released over a few hours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Aer@@ ob@@ aze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis ( hypo@@ cr@@ ates , caused by an allergy to p@@ ollen caused inflammation of the nose ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ c@@ tiv@@ al swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) .
in adults and adolescents from 12 years the recommended dose of Aer@@ in@@ aze is twice daily a tablet that should be taken entirely with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible , as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) , are suspended .
treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug may be found on the block@@ age of the nose .
the main effects were the changes in the sever@@ ity of the hypo@@ cr@@ ite symptoms that were reported from patients before the start of treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , patients carried their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and rated a default scale , as heavily the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
in case of all loc@@ ust@@ u@@ pf@@ en@@ sy@@ symptoms but the block@@ age of the nose reported the patients who came to aer@@ onau@@ tics , over a decrease of symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % , compared with 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in the patients receiving p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine alone .
if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was considered , the patients under Aer@@ ob@@ aze showed a reli@@ eving of symptoms by 3@@ 7.4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in patients who had des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in alone .
the most common side effects of Aer@@ ob@@ aze ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are speed@@ ometer , di@@ zz@@ iness , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ omot@@ or hyper@@ activity ( lack of appet@@ ite ) , fo@@ ster@@ ing , head@@ ache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( in@@ som@@ nia ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sleep@@ iness ) , in@@ som@@ nia and nerv@@ ousness .
Aer@@ ob@@ aze may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine or any of the other components , against rep@@ in@@ ep@@ hr@@ ine agents or lau@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( another medicine for the treatment of aller@@ gies ) are not used .
Aer@@ in@@ aze can also not be used in patients that suffer from a narrow @-@ angle glau@@ coma ( hypertension ) , cardi@@ ov@@ ascular disease ( hypertension ) , hypertension ( hypertension ) , or even a risk of hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke ( cereb@@ ral hem@@ or@@ rh@@ age ) , or a risk of hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke .
on 30 July 2007 the European Commission granted the company SP Europe approval for the In@@ traffic of Aer@@ ob@@ aze in the entire European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , however , is to be swallowed ( i.e. without them to cr@@ ush or che@@ w ) .
Aer@@ in@@ aze should not be applied to children under 12 years due to the lack of data for un@@ question@@ able and efficacy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the end of the symptoms .
it is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days , since long @-@ term application can take the activity of p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine at the time .
after the decrease of mu@@ g@@ ous membran@@ es in the upper respir@@ atory tract , treatment can be continued with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in as a mon@@ otherapy .
since Aer@@ ob@@ aze contains P@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients who are treated with a mono@@ am@@ oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or or within 2 weeks after the termination of such therapy .
this is attri@@ but@@ able to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined application of p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine with other vas@@ o@@ on@@ struc@@ tions such as Bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pit@@ in , Per@@ go@@ y@@ dro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine or other Dec@@ on@@ gest@@ iv@@ a , the per@@ oral or nas@@ al as ab@@ orted Rhin@@ o ( phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ pan@@ ol@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine , Nap@@ haz@@ ard etc . ) .
safety and effectiveness of this combination therapy were not examined for this patient collective , and the data are not sufficient to express appropriate recommendations .
safety and the efficacy of aer@@ onau@@ tics were not checked in patients with kidney or liver function , and the data is not sufficient to express appropriate recommendations .
patients need to be informed about the treatment of a hypertension or speed@@ ometer , or of pal@@ pit@@ ations , ar@@ rhyth@@ mia , nau@@ sea or any other neurolog@@ ical symptoms ( like head@@ aches or a gain of the head@@ aches ) .
care of the following patient groups will be careful : • Pati@@ ents under digit@@ alis &quot; patients with heart rhythm disorders - patients with hyper@@ ton@@ ia • patients with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder or bron@@ chos@@ pas@@ m in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese .
Aer@@ onau@@ aze is to susp@@ end at least 48 hours prior to performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests , since anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines can prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions or reduce in its mag@@ n@@ itude .
in the context of clinical ex@@ ams with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , in which er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were added , however , no clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions or change of the plasma concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in were observed .
in the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or tests , there were no significant differences between patients treated with placebo and placebo @-@ treated patients regardless of whether des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in alone or alcohol was taken .
the enzyme Q10 has not yet been identified for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , so that inter@@ actions with other medicines cannot be excluded .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in@@ hi@@ bits in @-@ vivo CY@@ P3@@ A4 , and in vitro studies have shown that the drug CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 is not in@@ hi@@ bits and neither a sub@@ strate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein .
the in@@ solven@@ cy of the application of aer@@ ob@@ aze during pregnancy is not secured , yet gained experience from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies , however , no increase in frequency of ab@@ normal@@ ities in comparison to the frequency of normal population .
since reproduction studies on animals are not always transferred to humans and due to v@@ ascular properties of p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine , Aer@@ ob@@ aze should not be applied in the pregnancy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the patients should be clari@@ fied , however , that it may result in very rare cases that may lead to a imp@@ air@@ ment of per@@ sever@@ ity or ability to serve machines . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , digest@@ ion , cardi@@ ov@@ ascular disease ) and a Z@@ NS stimulation ( in@@ som@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , trem@@ or , vul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ tering .

a CN@@ S stimulation is especially prob@@ able with children , as well as at@@ rop@@ in @-@ typical symptoms ( mou@@ dr@@ y@@ ness , pup@@ il star@@ re and - di@@ at@@ ation , skin comfort , hyper@@ ther@@ mia , gast@@ ro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include both inhibit@@ ing of pro@@ infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 , IL @-@ 8 , IL @-@ 8 , IL @-@ 8 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 of human master cells and the expression of the adhes@@ ion sm@@ ol@@ ec@@ ül@@ s P @-@ sel@@ tin on end@@ ot@@ hel@@ ial cells .
in a single dose @-@ dose of adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in showed no influence on standard measuring sizes of flu@@ o@@ rest@@ ation including ampli@@ fication of subjective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks that are connected to the flies .
in controlled clinical studies , the recommended dosage of 5 m@@ g. daily was no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo .
the oral application of p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine in the recommended dosage can cause further symp@@ a@@ thetic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a speed@@ ometer or manifest@@ ations of a Z@@ NS ar@@ ous@@ al .
it took 1,@@ 248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis , whereby 4@@ 14 patients received Aer@@ in@@ aze tablets .
in both studies the hist@@ am@@ ant@@ agon@@ istic efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ aze tablets , determined by the total co@@ res for symptoms ( except nas@@ al mu@@ c@@ tiv@@ al swelling ) , significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ aze tablets with regard to the swelling effect , determined on the basis of the nas@@ al mu@@ c@@ tiv@@ al swelling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ aze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender , age or ethnic origin .
as part of a single dose study on Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Aer@@ ob@@ aze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in is demon@@ stra@@ ble within 30 minutes after administration .
following the per@@ oral application of Aer@@ ob@@ aze with healthy subjects over 14 days , the flow of the flow of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine was reached on Day 10 .
in the framework of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dos@@ ing study , which was performed with form@@ ulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects , was found that four female subjects des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in were badly damaged .
a component inter@@ actions study shows that exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) of p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine according to the sole gift of P@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine was the exposition to the gift of an Aer@@ inist tablet .
based on conventional studies on safety mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity with repeated gift , for gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and for reproduction , the pre @-@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in disc@@ usses no special dangers for man .
the combination had no greater tox@@ icity as its individual components , and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredient p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine .
in re@@ produc@@ tion@@ ing clinical studies , the combination of Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in / p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine was not ter@@ med up in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and on rab@@ bits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
in March 2007 and in the 1.@@ 8.1 of the application form , pharmac@@ ov@@ ig@@ il@@ ance system is established and works before and while the product is on the market .

A@@ eri@@ us was evaluated in a total of eight studies involving approximately 4 800 adults and juven@@ iles with allergic rhin@@ itis ( including four trials in seasonal rhin@@ itis and two studies of patients who also had asthma patients ) .
efficacy was measured by changing the symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of add@@ ling , imp@@ air@@ ment of sleep and performance on days ) before and after six weeks of treatment .
further studies have been presented to prove that the body uses the sy@@ rup , the solution to insert and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and application in children is harmless .
allergic rhin@@ itis carried out when the results of all trials were considered , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us was given an average decrease of symptoms ( symptoms ) of 25 to 32 % , compared with the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients who received a placebo .
in the two studies of Ur@@ tik@@ aria the decrease of symptoms after six weeks treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % was compared with 40 and 33 % compared with placebo @-@ treated patients .
A@@ eri@@ us may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , lau@@ at@@ ad@@ ine or any of the other components .
in January 2001 , the European Commission granted the company SP Europe to appro@@ ve A@@ erial approval in the entire European Union .
one tablet once daily , with one or without a meal , to alle@@ vi@@ ate symptoms of allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there are limited experience from clinical trials for the effectiveness in the use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in young people aged 12 to 17 ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be termin@@ ated according to the previous issue of health and may be resumed after the end of the symptoms .
the persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ( occurrence of symptoms of 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks ) can be recommended to patients during the All@@ ergy period .
clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions were not identified as part of clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine tablets , in which er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were also given ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clin@@ ically @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , alcohol is not ampli@@ fied in the current consumption of alcohol and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the patients should be clari@@ fied in very rare cases that may occur in very rare cases that can lead to imp@@ air@@ ment of per@@ sever@@ ity or ability to serve machines . &quot; &quot; &quot;
clinical trials in various indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idiopath@@ ic ur@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than patients who were treated with placebo .
the most frequent adverse events that were reported more frequently than in placebo were fatigue ( 1,2 % ) , harmon@@ ica ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ aches ( 0.6 % ) .
in a clinical study with 5@@ 78 young patients from 12 to 17 years the most common side of head@@ aches , this occurred at 5.@@ 9 % of patients who were treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , and 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with placebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study , with up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( nin@@ ety clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
this includes both inhibit@@ ing of pro@@ infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 , IL @-@ 8 , IL @-@ 8 , IL @-@ 8 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 of human master cells and the expression of the adhes@@ ion sm@@ ol@@ ec@@ ül@@ s P @-@ sel@@ tin on end@@ ot@@ hel@@ ial cells .
as part of a clinical study with multiple conduc@@ tors , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine administered over 14 days a day , no statist@@ ically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardi@@ ov@@ ascular effect was described .
in a clin@@ ically pharmac@@ ological study , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of 45 m@@ g. a day ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) was administered over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c interval was seen .
for a single dos@@ ing study of adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in showed no influence on standard measuring sizes of flu@@ o@@ rest@@ ation including ampli@@ fication of subjective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks that are connected to the flies .
in patients with allergic rhin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as ni@@ eses , nostr@@ ils and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ vation and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate .
in addition to the established classification in sa@@ is@@ onal and per@@ enni@@ al , an allergic rhin@@ itis can be divided in dependence on the duration of symptoms alternatively also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
as demonstrated by the total co@@ res of the quest@@ ionnaire to life of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ lig@@ tiv@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis .
the chronic idiopath@@ ic ur@@ aria was investigated as a representative for further forms of urine , because the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology is dis@@ regarded as the underlying path@@ ology in different forms and chronic patients can be recru@@ ited easier .
since the hist@@ amine release is a caus@@ al factor in all primary diseases , is expected to improve the lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in other forms of urine to improve the symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines .
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopath@@ ic ur@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of add@@ ling at the end of the first dos@@ is@@ inter@@ v@@ alls .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines in chronic idiopath@@ ic ur@@ aria the minority of patients who did not react to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines , was excluded from the study .
improvement of the it@@ enti@@ ves around more than 50 % was observed with 55 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in treated patients treated with placebo @-@ treated patients .
treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and growth as it was measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to assess the variable .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics study , in which patients with the general seas@@ on@@ ally allergic rhin@@ itis @-@ population was comparable , 4 % of patients achieved a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .
there are no clu@@ ster@@ ing points for clin@@ ically relevant cou@@ plings after once daily application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
however , the enzyme Q10 has not yet been identified for the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in enzyme , so that inter@@ actions with other medicines should not be excluded
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in@@ hi@@ bits non CY@@ P3@@ A4 and in vitro studies have shown that the medicine CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 is not in@@ hi@@ bits and neither a sub@@ strate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein .
in a single dos@@ ing study with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( fet@@ al , low @-@ cal@@ ory breakfast ) did not affect the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in .
the clinical studies carried out with the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in study showed a comparable degree of exposure of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , no qualitative or quantitative differences in the tox@@ icity studies by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in .
based on conventional studies for security mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity with repeated gift , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and for reproduction , pre@@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in no special dangers for man recognize .

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of the meals , to alle@@ vi@@ ate symptoms of allergic rhin@@ itis ( including an inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the prescri@@ ption doctor should be aware that most cases of Rhin@@ itis is caused by infection in children under 2 years ( see section 4.4 ) and that no data suggest that support an infection of inf@@ ectious rhin@@ itis with A@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to the exclusion of upper respir@@ atory infections or anatom@@ ical an@@ om@@ ali@@ es , the diagnosis , physical investigations and appropriate laboratory and skin tests should play a role .
for about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years of age , des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is restricted and experienced a higher level of sub@@ strate ( see section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up in children between 2 and 11 years , who are limited met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed , is identical to children who are normal met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed .

in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study the amount of alcohol is not ampli@@ fied in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study ( see section 5.1 ) .
the total frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up group as in the placebo group .
clinical trials with adults and adolescents in various indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idiopath@@ ic ur@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than patients who were treated with placebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study of adults and juven@@ iles , with up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( nin@@ ety clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
children between 1 and 11 years old , who came to an anti@@ hist@@ amine therapy in question , got a daily des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ind@@ osis of 1.@@ 25 mg ( between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic rhin@@ itis / chronic idiopath@@ ic ur@@ aria and the profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in is similar in adults and children , the efficacy data of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in can be extra@@ pol@@ ated in adults to the children &apos;s population .
in the context of a clinical study of multiple adults and juven@@ iles , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of up to 20 mg has been applied daily for 14 days , no statist@@ ically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardi@@ ov@@ ascular effect was described .
in a clin@@ ically pharmac@@ ological study of adults and juven@@ iles , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of 45 m@@ g. a day ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) was applied more than ten days in adults , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c interval was found .
in controlled clinical trials the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and teen@@ agers had no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo .
for a single daily dose of 7,5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets resulted in clinical trials to no imp@@ air@@ ment of the psych@@ omot@@ or .
in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies on adults , alcohol was neither a rein@@ forcement of alcohol @-@ induced performance det@@ ailing to increase drow@@ sin@@ ess .
in adult and adol@@ es@@ cent patients with allergic rhin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as ni@@ eses , nostr@@ ils and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ vation and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate .
as with the total co@@ res of the quest@@ ionnaire to life of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ lig@@ tiv@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduced the allergic allergic rhin@@ itis .
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopath@@ ic ur@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of add@@ ling at the end of the first dos@@ is@@ inter@@ v@@ alls .
the spread of this limited met@@ abo@@ li@@ ous phen@@ otyp@@ s was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Cau@@ cas@@ ians ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study with sy@@ up@@ form@@ ulation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rhin@@ itis , which are generally met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed , observed .
the load ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in was approximately 6@@ mal higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ max . 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ time of approximately 120 hours .
there are no clu@@ ster@@ ing points for clin@@ ically relevant drug cum@@ ulation according to the daily application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days for adults and juven@@ iles .
12 In several single dose studies , AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ max values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine showed in p@@ ä@@ di@@ at@@ ric patients with those recommended doses comparable to those of adults who received the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .
however , the enzyme Q10 has not yet been identified for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in enzyme , so that inter@@ actions with other medicines cannot be excluded .

immediately before application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of melting tablet is removed without dam@@ aging them .
efficacy and dis@@ comfort of A@@ eri@@ us 2,5 mg of hot tablets in the treatment of children under 6 years has not been proven yet .
the total frequency of side effects between the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine Sir@@ up@@ - and the placebo group was the same and did not significantly reduce the safety profile of the adult patients .
at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us melting tablet is a bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets form@@ ulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at for reducing the form@@ ulation of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in .

the total frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in group like the placebo group .
in infants between 6 and 23 months , the most frequent adverse events were reported which was reported more frequently than in placebo , diar@@ rho@@ e ( 3.7 % ) , fever ( 2,3 % ) and in@@ som@@ nia ( 2,3 % ) .
in an additional study , a one @-@ time dose of 2.5 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in solution were observed no side effects in patients at the age between 6 and 11 years .
at recommended doses , the recommended doses of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( see section 5.2 ) were comparable in children &apos;s and adult population .
in controlled clinical trials the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and teen@@ agers had no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo .
in addition to the established classification in sa@@ is@@ onal and per@@ enni@@ al , an allergic rhin@@ itis is alternatively dependent on the duration of symptoms and also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis and
as with the total co@@ res of the quest@@ ionnaire to life of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ lig@@ tiv@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduced the stress caused by seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis .

in June 2008 Nov@@ artis V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. officially distributed the committee on approval for the domestic H@@ 5@@ N1 influ@@ enza to prevent the avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N1 influ@@ enza in adults and elderly people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect flu caused by the trunk ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N1 of influ@@ enza A virus .
this is a special kind of vaccine , which could cause a trunk of influ@@ enza virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
a Gri@@ pp@@ ep@@ an@@ dem@@ ie breaks out if a new tribe of influ@@ enza virus emerges from man to humans , because humans have not yet built imm@@ unity ( no protection ) against it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after administration of the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es the parts of the influ@@ enza virus as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; physical alien &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and forms anti@@ bodies against it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this makes the immune system later able to form a rapid antibody in contact with an influ@@ enza virus of this tribe .
subsequently , the membrane covers the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which recogni@@ zes the human body as body @-@ foreign ) , cleaned and used as an ingredient of the vaccine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not performed according to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good clinical practice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( G@@ CP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thereby , the scope of clinical data base for evalu@@ ating the safety of the vaccine is not enough to meet the requirements of the EMEA to meet pre @-@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines .
should you take part in a clinical trial and need further information regarding your treatment , please consult your doctor .
if you wish further information regarding the recommendations of CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is used in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al drugs for the treatment of adults and children over four years , suffering from Human Immun@@ e Def@@ iciency Syndrome ( AIDS ) , which causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who can &apos;t swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ moun@@ ase is available as a solution for inser@@ tion , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , because the security of this combination has not been examined .
A@@ bo@@ ase should only be classified if the doctor has examined which is previously used an@@ tivir@@ al drug of patient before , and the lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood is that the virus is to address the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , taken together with twice daily 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and other an@@ tivir@@ al drugs .
for children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ moun@@ ase is based on body weight .
aspir@@ in reduces the HIV @-@ amount of blood in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al drugs on the blood and keeps them at a low level .
AIDS is not to heal , however , the damage of the immune system and thus also hes@@ it@@ ating development of AIDS related infections and diseases .
aspir@@ in was investigated in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al drugs , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , studied in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who previously had not been treated with prot@@ eases .
this drug ash@@ on@@ avi@@ r increased drug A@@ gener@@ ase has been compared with 206 adults who previously used Prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors to be compared with other Prot@@ ease In@@ dies .
the main indi@@ k@@ ator for the effectiveness was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable concentration of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the change of viral load after treatment .
in studies with patients who previously had not taken a prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , even after 48 weeks under A@@ gener@@ ase , more patients had a viral load of 400 copies / ml than under Plac@@ ebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than In@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ gener@@ ase also reduced the viral load , however , of the children who had been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors earlier , only very few to the treatment .
in the study with adults who had been treated earlier with Prot@@ ease In@@ dies , the viral load reinforced with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r reinforced medicine A@@ moun@@ ase the viral load after 16 @-@ week treatment just as effective as other Prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
in the patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other Prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it came under A@@ gener@@ ase along with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r a stronger decrease of the virus last four weeks compared to patients who share their previous Prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or :
the most common adverse events of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( nau@@ sea ) , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , vom@@ iting , r@@ ash and F@@ atigue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ generation may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against am@@ alg@@ avi@@ r or one of other components .
aspir@@ in may also not be used in patients , the cur@@ rant wort ( a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression ) or medicines that are equally harmful to health and harmful in high concentrations in the blood of health .
as with other medicines for HIV , patients who are taking A@@ gener@@ ase ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , an oste@@ opor@@ osis ( decrease of bone tissue ) or an immun@@ o@@ activation syndrome ( symptoms of infection caused by the re@@ juven@@ ating immune system ) .
the conclusion that the benefits of genetic medicines ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of A@@ moun@@ ase were used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks involved .
A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee stated that the benefit of A@@ moun@@ ase in combination with kn@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who previously had no prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or not proven .
A@@ gener@@ ase was originally licensed under &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; at the time of approval from scientific reasons only limited information .
in October 2000 , the European Commission informed the company G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited with approval for transport of aspir@@ in throughout the European Union .
aspir@@ in is in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral pharmac@@ euticals for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1- infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ previously treated adults and children aged 4 years onwards .
usually , A@@ gener@@ ase should be given to the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ emy of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r should take place in consideration of the individual viral resistance pattern and pre@@ treatment of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r as a solution to take up is 14 % lower than the capsule ; therefore , A@@ moun@@ ase capsules and solution are not inter@@ changeable for a milli@@ grams per milli@@ gram basis ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ Gener@@ ase capsules is 600 mg am@@ b@@ avi@@ r twice daily with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral pharmac@@ euticals .
2 If A@@ moun@@ ase Cap@@ sules can be applied without the intensi@@ fying addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Boo@@ steri@@ fication ) , need to be applied to higher doses ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ Gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg am@@ b@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral pharmac@@ euticals up to a daily dose of 2400 mg Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of an@@ tic@@ ase in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not investigated in children .
as@@ sel@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years due to the lack of data for imm@@ unity and efficacy ( see section 5.2 ) .
based on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of asthma capsules with adult liver function should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function amounts to 300 mg twice daily .
simultaneous application should be determined in patients with mild or moderate liver function with caution , in patients with severe liver function , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
aspir@@ in may not be given simultaneously with medicines that display a low therapeutic width and also sub@@ str@@ ates the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P3@@ A4 ) .
vegetable preparations , St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) included , may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentration and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be pointed out that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy cannot lead to a cure of HIV infection , and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or complications of an HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with aspir@@ ase does not prevent the risk of transfer@@ ring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
usually , A@@ generic gases are to be used together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral pharmac@@ euticals ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients who are suffering from chronic hepat@@ itis B or C , and treated with an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy , have increased risk for severe liver effects with potentially fatal .
for the case of simultaneous an@@ tivir@@ al treatment of hepat@@ itis B or C , please read the related subject information of this medicine .
patients with existing limited liver function , including chronic hepat@@ itis , showed an increased frequency of liver dys@@ functions under an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
simultaneous use of A@@ moun@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with fluor@@ tic@@ ular or other glu@@ co@@ co@@ ids , that are transmitted via CY@@ P3@@ A4 , is not recommended unless the potential benefits of treatment system@@ ic cor@@ ti@@ ost@@ ero@@ i@@ der effects including Mor@@ bus C@@ ushing and supp@@ ression of the side ni@@ er@@ en@@ function ( see section 4.5 ) .
because the fuel change of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on CY@@ P3@@ A4 , is not recommended for an simultaneous stopping of an@@ tigen with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin because of the increased risk of my@@ op@@ opath@@ ies including R@@ hab@@ omet@@ y@@ oly@@ sis .
4 For some medicines that can cause severe or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects , such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of International norm@@ alized R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the active concentration .
for patients who use this medicine at the same time , aspir@@ ase may be less effective due to a reduced plasma level of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of met@@ abolic inter@@ actions with Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r , the efficacy of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives may be altered , however , the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interaction .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ i@@ at@@ ent@@ ric symptoms , especially if there are still low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
due to the possible risk of tox@@ icity , due to the high prop@@ yl gly@@ col@@ t solution of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution , this form@@ ulation form is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be used with care in certain other patient groups .
A@@ moun@@ ase should be placed on duration 5 if a r@@ ash of system@@ ic or allergic symptoms are accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
in patients who received an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ eases , was reported on the occurrence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , or an ex@@ az@@ erb@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus .
many of the patients had other ill@@ nesses , to their therapy , to be associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
B. higher age , and with drug addic@@ ts , such as a lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy and associated met@@ abolic disorders .
in ha@@ em@@ oph@@ ile patients ( Type A and B ) , which were treated with prot@@ eases , reports on an increase of bleeding including the spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ oma and hem@@ mar@@ thro@@ sis occur .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immun@@ o@@ deficiency therapy ( ART ) may develop an infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory response to as@@ y@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ dual opportun@@ istic infections that lead to severe clinical conditions or deteri@@ oration of symptoms .
although a multi@@ fac@@ tor@@ ial e@@ ti@@ ology is assumed ( including application of corrosion @-@ ero@@ ids , alcohol consumption , heavy immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ression , higher Body Mass Index ) , cases of advanced HIV @-@ disease and / or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
CY@@ P3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width A@@ generation may not be given simultaneously with medicines , which represent a low therapeutic width and also sub@@ str@@ ates the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P3@@ A4 ) .
CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width A@@ generation with kn@@ on@@ avi@@ r must not be used together with medicines , their active ingredients are primarily associated with CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and are linked to increased plasma and / or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects .
it was shown that R@@ if@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r which can lead to an ast@@ rolog@@ ical failure and to a resistance development .
in the attempt , the re@@ shaping plasma he@@ d@@ geho@@ gs caused by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r have been observed very often unwanted effects on the liver .
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The ser@@ um levels of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r can be induced by the simultaneous use of plant preparations with cur@@ rant wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
if a patient already decre@@ ases St. John &apos;s wort , the Am@@ end@@ av@@ irus comes and if possible to check the viral load and depos@@ e St. John &apos;s wort .
a dose adjustment for one of the drug is not necessary if Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ ter@@ ir@@ enz below ) .
508 % increase if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) is administered in combination with Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical studies , dos@@ ages of 600 mg Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r used twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , which prove the efficacy and un@@ question@@ able of this treatment schem@@ at@@ as .
52 % decre@@ ases when Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) combined with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) was given .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) were achieved in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
a dos@@ ing dosage for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , but it is not recommended to use nar@@ rowing monitoring since its effectiveness and imm@@ unity of this combination is not known .
there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study on the use of an@@ dan@@ o in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , but is recommended because of the ant@@ azi@@ one component of di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , however , that the revenue of di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and as@@ generic gases are at least one hour apart . ( see Ant@@ acids below ) .
therefore , in combination with am@@ ir@@ abo@@ ons ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dos@@ is@@ adjustment is required .
the treatment with the ir@@ radi@@ otherapy in combination with Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended , as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would de@@ grade .
the effects of Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in to other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggest that Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ ine may be sun@@ k into the ser@@ um concentration of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r .
if these medicines should be used simultaneously , caution is advis@@ able because Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din is less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma concentration .
when this drug is used together , caution is advis@@ able ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ rology monitoring is to be made , as a precise pre@@ diction of the effects of the combination of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is difficult at Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din .
the simultaneous gift of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r and R@@ if@@ ab@@ ut@@ in led to an increase in plasma concentration of 193 % ( AU@@ C ) of R@@ if@@ ab@@ ut@@ in to increase the side effects associated with R@@ if@@ ab@@ ut@@ in .
if it is required for clinical reasons , R@@ if@@ ab@@ ut@@ in combined with A@@ gener@@ ase is recommended to reduce the dose of R@@ if@@ ab@@ ut@@ in at least half of the recommended dose , although no clinical data can be found .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with aspir@@ in in combination with er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not performed , but the plasma reflection of both medicines could be increased in the case of con@@ current administration .
simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg of c@@ os@@ amp@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily resulted in a increase of c@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole on 2,@@ 69@@ times compared to the value that was observed after 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily with no simultaneous use of F@@ os@@ amp@@ ut@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines that are listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , inhibit@@ or or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P3@@ A4 , can be applied together with aspir@@ ase may lead to inter@@ actions .
patients should therefore be based on toxic reactions which are combined with these medicines , if they are applied in combination with aspir@@ ase .
based on the data of other prot@@ eases , it is advis@@ able that Ant@@ acids are not taken at the same time as aspir@@ ase may occur as it may come to res@@ or@@ ption .
the simultaneous use of anti@@ con@@ vul@@ s@@ va that are known as enzymes ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with Am@@ resist@@ avi@@ r can lead to a lower level of plasma reflection of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r .
the ser@@ um concentration of calcium @-@ channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , di@@ pin pin , ni@@ f@@ pin , Nim@@ odi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Nim@@ odi@@ pine , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased 10 by Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r , which may increase the activity and tox@@ icity of this medicine .
simultaneous in@@ gest@@ ion with A@@ gener@@ ase may increase their plasma cent@@ ri@@ cul@@ ations and ampli@@ fy with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in conjunction with the P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in conjunction with hyp@@ ot@@ ace@@ tic , visual distur@@ ban@@ ces and prim@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study , in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily with 50 µ@@ g of fluid pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days of subjects were reduced by approximately 86 % ( 90 % -@@ conv@@ ection interval 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous gift of A@@ moun@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended with these glu@@ co@@ res co@@ ids , unless the potential benefits of treatment system@@ ic cor@@ ti@@ ost@@ ero@@ y ( see section 4.4 ) .
at H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , which depends heavily from CY@@ P3@@ A4 , increased enh@@ ancements of plasma screens with simultaneous increase of A@@ moun@@ ase .
since plasma cutting increases of these H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or can lead to my@@ opathy including a R@@ hab@@ omet@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined application of this drug is not recommended with Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r .
there is a frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations as recommended as stabil@@ isation of the mirrors , as the plasma cent@@ ri@@ cul@@ ations of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , Rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus can be increased by the same gift of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.4 ) .
therefore A@@ moun@@ ase may not be applied together with or@@ ally collected mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) , while in the same application of A@@ gener@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am caution is advis@@ able .
data on the simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ein@@ ase inhibit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in the plasma level by Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am for 3 to 4 times .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be super@@ vised on op@@ i@@ at@@ ent@@ ric symptoms , especially if there are still low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
because of the maximum reliability of historical compar@@ isons , there is currently no recommendation to be adjusted , such as the Am@@ orph@@ an dose can be adjusted simultaneously with meth@@ ad@@ one .
in the same gift of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ bodies along with A@@ gener@@ ase , a stronger control of IN@@ R ( International norm@@ alised debt ratio ) is recommended because of the possibility of a weak@@ ening or ampli@@ fication of the anti@@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predic@@ table , so alternative methods are recommended to contrac@@ eption .
careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants ( for example , Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Normal fertility ) is recommended for the same gift of an@@ tic@@ ase ( see section 4.4 ) .
this medicine may be used only after the pregnancy of the possible use of the possible use@@ fulness in comparison to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
in the milk l@@ ak@@ ov@@ ent rats , Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances were detected , but it is not known whether Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r is transferred to people in breast milk .
a reproduction study at toler@@ able rats , which was administered by the ni@@ o@@ rest@@ ation in the u@@ terus to the end of the lac@@ tation , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in 12 body weight during a halt .
the further development of the descendants including fertility and reproduction was not imp@@ aired by the administration of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r to the parent .
the in@@ solven@@ cy of A@@ generation was examined in adults and in children 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral pharmac@@ euticals .
most of the side effects associated with A@@ gener@@ ase treatment were mild to moderate , compet@@ ed early in early and rarely introduced to treatment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with many of these events , it is not clari@@ fied whether they are used in connection with in@@ gest@@ ion or other medicines at the same time , or if they are a consequence of cruel treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
most of the above @-@ mentioned side effects come from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which prot@@ eases previously untreated patients received 1,200 mg of A@@ moun@@ ase twice daily .
events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) performed by investig@@ denti@@ sts in relation to study medication , and with more than 1 % of patients were performed , and also under the treatment of occurring laboratory changes ( Grade 3 to 4 ) are listed .
the anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with a re@@ distribution of body fat ( li@@ po@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including one loss of natural and fast sub@@ ju@@ g@@ inal fatty tissue , increased intra@@ ocular and vis@@ cer@@ al fatty tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ ph@@ ony of breasts and dor@@ so@@ cr@@ ate fat accumulation .
among the 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral did not pre @-@ treated persons treated with Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r in combination with Lam@@ iv@@ ud@@ ine / zi@@ dov@@ ud@@ ine over a medium length of 36 weeks , only one case ( bul@@ let ) was observed ( &lt; 1 % ) .
in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 patients with 245 N@@ R@@ TI@@ - previously treated patients under Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 11 % ) in 241 patients under In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , combined with various N@@ RT@@ Is over a medium length of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) .
r@@ ash strikes were usually mild to moderate , er@@ y@@ them@@ at@@ ous or mac@@ u@@ lo@@ pap@@ ul@@ ously nature , with or without it@@ ching and compet@@ ed spont@@ ane@@ ously during the second week of treatment and disappeared spont@@ ane@@ ously within two weeks without having to be canc@@ eled with Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r .
in particular , oste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose cases were reported in particular in patients with generally known risk factors , advanced HIV @-@ disease or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immun@@ o@@ deficiency therapy ( ART ) , an infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory reaction to as@@ y@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ dual opportun@@ istic infections can develop ( see section 4.4 ) .
patients treated with PI pre @-@ treated patients who were observed twice daily with low dose @-@ induced kn@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Grade 3 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( degree 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( degree 2 to 4 ) and C@@ p@@ k @-@ values , which were given in patients who received A@@ gener@@ ase together with low dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in case of an over@@ dose the patient is observed on signs of an in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) if necessary , necessary supp@@ or@@ tive measures .
Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r binds to the active centre of HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease and prevents the proc@@ ession of viral g@@ ag@@ s- and g@@ ag @-@ pol@@ - poly@@ prot@@ ein@@ ation steps with the result of an ass@@ ail@@ ant , non @-@ inf@@ ectious viral particles .
the an@@ tivir@@ al activity of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was studied both in acute and chronic lympho@@ bl@@ astic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripher@@ al blood lympho@@ cytes .
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ konzentr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r lies in the range from 0,0@@ 12 to 0.0@@ 8 µ@@ M in acute cells and is 0,@@ 41 µ@@ M in chronic infected cells
the connection between the activity of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in treating anti@@ retro@@ viral untreated patients with the currently permitted F@@ os@@ amp@@ ut@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ Do@@ si@@ p - such as other kn@@ on@@ avi@@ an inhibit@@ ors with prot@@ ein@@ ase inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described only rarely were observed .
sixteen patients treated with 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral patients treated twice daily in the study ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 twice a day in the study ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 , where 14 isol@@ ate gen@@ otyp@@ ic could be investigated .
a gen@@ otyp@@ ical analysis of the isol@@ ates of 13 of 14 children , with whom a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure occurred within the 59 , with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors not previously treated patients showed resistance pattern that were similar to those in adults .
L@@ 10@@ F / I / V , V@@ 11@@ I , K@@ 20@@ R , V@@ 32@@ V , M@@ 36@@ V , M@@ 36@@ V , I@@ 50@@ V , I@@ 50@@ V , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 77@@ V , V@@ 77@@ V , V@@ 77@@ V , V@@ 77@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , and I@@ 93@@ L / M .
in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 3 study and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg of c@@ os@@ amp@@ ut@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) patients treated with vi@@ rology charts over 96 weeks , the following Prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or mut@@ ations appeared :
based on gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance analysis , Gen@@ otyp@@ ic inter@@ pret@@ ations can be used to estimate the activity of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r for patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 @-@ algorithm for F@@ os@@ amp@@ ut@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations L@@ 10@@ F / I , L@@ 33@@ F , I@@ 36@@ A / C / F / G , I@@ 84@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in combination with a increased peripher@@ al resistance to F@@ os@@ amp@@ ut@@ avi@@ r with a reduced probability of a vi@@ rology response ( resist@@ ence ) .
the conclusions regarding the relev@@ ance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ations can be subject to additional data , and it is recommended to always attract current inter@@ pret@@ ations to analyze the results of resistance tests .
based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance analysis , clin@@ ically vali@@ dated phen@@ otyp@@ ic inter@@ pret@@ ations can be used in conjunction with the gen@@ otyp@@ ic data on the assessment of the activity of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r for patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
companies to drive diagnostic resistance tests have been developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ offs ( separ@@ ations ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be used for interpretation of a resistance tests .
each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r associated genetic patterns creates a certain cross@@ resistance to Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved .
there are currently data on the cross @-@ resist@@ ence between Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 F@@ os@@ amp@@ ut@@ r Resist@@ or , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients ( one of which showed a resistance to Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , In@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , ca@@ quin@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , sa@@ vi@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) .
vice versa , Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r keeps his activity against some other Prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the receipt of these activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
early departure of a failed therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in boundaries that can trigger the subsequent treatment .
the evidence of the effectiveness of A@@ moun@@ ase in combination with kn@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 ( 100 mg twice daily ) and nu@@ cle@@ o@@ side alog@@ a ( N@@ RT@@ I ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , mainly with low @-@ rated kn@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
one hundred and sixty @-@ thre@@ es@@ core ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ moun@@ ase , at least one other PI and at least one N@@ RT@@ I included in the study study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis provided the non @-@ sub @-@ balance of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the period adjusted average ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the Plasma @-@ 1 RNA ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in a non @-@ drug shaft of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the evidence of the effectiveness of untreated A@@ generation is based on two un@@ controlled trials with a total of 288 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 will be treated with PI .
in the studies , A@@ gener@@ ase solution was used twice daily , 20 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , with the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily .
there was no low do@@ zed kn@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously had at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ RT@@ Is .
after 48 weeks , the patients included a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration of &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase of CD@@ 4 cell numbers of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 19 Based on these data should be considered at the therapy optim@@ isation with PI to be expected to be considered at the expected value of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ ble@@ ached &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aspir@@ ase . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after oral administration , the mean duration ( t@@ max ) to the maximum ser@@ um concentration of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
508 % increased , for C@@ max by 30 % reduced when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with am@@ bas@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease of AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) of food intake remained un@@ affected , although the amount of food influences the extent and rates of res@@ or@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume is about 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be placed on a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ hin@@ ted penetration of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
this change leads to a decrease in the overall concentration of the active ingredient in the plasma , with the amount of in@@ bound Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r , which represents the active proportion which remains unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active components during dos@@ ing inter@@ v@@ alls in the Ste@@ ady @-@ State during the C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , medicines , the CY@@ P3@@ A4 in@@ duce or in@@ hi@@ bits or a sub@@ strate of CY@@ P3@@ A4 , should be given caution when they are given simultaneously with aspir@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of A@@ moun@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily am@@ at@@ avi@@ r exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily .
Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r is available from the solution 14 % less bi@@ over@@ feed than from the capsules ; hence A@@ gener@@ ase solution and A@@ generate capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram@@ m@@ base .
the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also negli@@ gible , so the effect of a kidney function might be minimal on the elim@@ ination of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
these treatment schem@@ ata are similar to those who are based on healthy volunteers following a dose of 1200 mg Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r twice daily without the simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies in mice with am@@ at@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats appeared in male animals ben@@ ig@@ ne ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - multiple ( rat ) of exposure to people , after twice a daily gift of 1200 mg Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r , spoke .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of o@@ cell @-@ cell car@@ cin@@ omas and car@@ cin@@ omas has not yet been resolved and the relev@@ ance of these observed effects for man is un@@ clear .
however , there are little evidence for the adoption of a clinical relev@@ ance of this findings from the present study data on humans , both from clinical studies and therapeutic use .
in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ification tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( am@@ it test ) , optic nerve tests on rats and chromosome ab@@ err@@ atic tests on human peripher@@ al lympho@@ cytes were neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
these liver tox@@ icity can be observed and proven by the measurement of AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
so far , clinical trials have not observed no significant liver tox@@ icity in patients , neither during the administration of as@@ generic gases , nor after the end of the treatment .
studies on tox@@ icity in young animals , which were treated at an age of 4 days , showed a high mortality in the control of the control and with the Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r animals .
in a systematic plasma concentration , which was significantly lower ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure under therapeutic dosage , however , a number of minor changes , including thy@@ mus ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes , were observed in a delayed development .
24 If A@@ moun@@ ase Cap@@ sules can be applied without the intensi@@ fying addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Boo@@ emy ) , need to apply higher doses to A@@ moun@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ Gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg am@@ b@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral pharmac@@ euticals up to a daily dose of 2400 mg Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
simultaneous application should be observed in patients with weak or light liver function with caution , in patients with severe liver function , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
26 For some medicines that can cause severe or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects , such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of International norm@@ alized R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the active concentration .
A@@ moun@@ ase should be set on duration 27 if a r@@ ash of system@@ ic or allergic symptoms are accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
an increased risk for a Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with pharmaceutical @-@ dependent factors such as a longer continuous anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy and associated met@@ abolic disorders .
it was shown that R@@ if@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r which can lead to an ast@@ rolog@@ ical failure and to a resistance development .
508 % increase if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) is administered in combination with Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) were achieved in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
a dos@@ ing dosage for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , but it is not recommended to use nar@@ rowing monitoring since its effectiveness and imm@@ unity of this combination is not known .
the treatment with the ir@@ radi@@ otherapy in combination with Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended , as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would de@@ grade .
when this drug is used together , caution is advis@@ able ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ rology monitoring is to be made , as a precise pre@@ diction of the effects of the combination of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is difficult at Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din .
if it is required for clinical reasons , R@@ if@@ ab@@ ut@@ in combined with A@@ gener@@ ase is advised to reduce the dose of R@@ if@@ ab@@ ut@@ in at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although no clinical data can be found .
the ser@@ um concentration of calcium @-@ channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , di@@ pin pin , ni@@ f@@ pin , Nim@@ odi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Nim@@ odi@@ pine , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r , which may increase the activity and tox@@ icity of this medicine .
in a clinical study , in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily with 50 µ@@ g of fluid pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days of subjects were reduced by approximately 86 % ( 90 % -@@ conv@@ ection interval 82 to 89 % ) .
in the same gift of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ bodies along with A@@ gener@@ ase , a stronger control of IN@@ R ( International norm@@ alised debt ratio ) is recommended because of the possibility of a weak@@ ening or ampli@@ fication of the anti@@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
simultaneous administration of Orth@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg of e@@ thin@@ y@@ le@@ stra@@ di@@ ol plus 1.0 mg of no@@ re@@ th@@ ind@@ ron ) led to a decrease of AU@@ C and C@@ min by Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r by 22 %
during pregnancy , this medicine may be used only after careful se@@ clu@@ sion of the possible use@@ fulness in comparison to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
a reproduction study at toler@@ able rats , which was administered by the ni@@ dation in the u@@ terus to the end of the lac@@ tation , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight during a halt .
the in@@ solven@@ cy of A@@ generation was examined in adults and in children 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral pharmac@@ euticals .
in case of an over@@ dose the patient is observed on signs of an in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) if necessary , necessary supp@@ or@@ tive measures .
the an@@ tivir@@ al activity of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was studied both in acute and chronic lympho@@ bl@@ astic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripher@@ al blood lympho@@ cytes .
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ konzentr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r lies in the range from 0.0@@ 12 to 0.0@@ 8 µ@@ M in acute cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M with chronic infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
vice versa , Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r keeps his activity against some other Prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the receipt of these activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
based on this data , the therapy optim@@ isation of PI treated with PI intended to be considered to be the expected value of &quot; un@@ bund@@ led &quot; aspir@@ ase . &quot;
while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active components during dos@@ ing inter@@ v@@ alls in the Ste@@ ady State in the area of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss ..
therefore , medicines , the CY@@ P3@@ A4 in@@ duce or in@@ hi@@ bits or a sub@@ strate of CY@@ P3@@ A4 , should be given caution when they are given simultaneously with aspir@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is negli@@ gible ; therefore the effect of a kidney function might be minimal on the elim@@ ination of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies in mice with am@@ at@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats appeared in male animals ben@@ ig@@ ne ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - multiple ( rat ) of exposure to people after twice a daily gift of 1200 mg Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r .
the underlying mechanism for the emergence of o@@ cel@@ ular aden@@ oma and car@@ cin@@ omas has not yet been resolved and the relev@@ ance of these observed effects for man is un@@ clear .
however , there are little evidence for the adoption of a clinical relev@@ ance of this findings , both from clinical trials as well as from the therapeutic application .
in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ification tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( am@@ it test ) , optic nerve tests on rats and chromosome ab@@ err@@ atic tests on human peripher@@ al lympho@@ cytes was neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
studies on tox@@ icity in young animals , which were treated at an age of 4 days , showed a high mortality in the control of the control and with the Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r animals .
these results allow it to conclude that in young , the met@@ abolic path@@ ways are not fully equipped , so Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the form@@ ulation ( z ) .
in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ previously treated adults and children from 4 years onwards are shown .

the bio@@ availability of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r as a solution to take up is 14 % lower than the capsule ; therefore , A@@ moun@@ ase capsules and solution are not inter@@ changeable for a milli@@ grams per milli@@ gram basis ( see section 5.2 ) .
the patients should , as soon as they are able to swal@@ low capsules , with taking the solution to stop ( see section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ Gener@@ ase solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) Am@@ resist@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral pharmac@@ euticals up to a daily dose of 2800 mg Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , there is no dose recommended for the simultaneous use of A@@ moun@@ ase solution to take and low d@@ osed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination of these patient groups can be avoided .
although a dose permit for Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r is not considered necessary , an application of A@@ gener@@ ase is contra@@ indicated in patients with kidney failure ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of high propylene gly@@ col@@ y@@ col@@ ts , A@@ gener@@ ase is contra@@ indicated in infants and children under 4 years , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure .
simultaneous dos@@ ing can lead to a compet@@ iti@@ vely in@@ hibition of the metabolism of this drug and may cause severe and / or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects such as heart rhythm disorders ( z ) .
patients should be pointed out that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy cannot lead to a cure of HIV infection , and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or complications of an HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with aspir@@ ase does not prevent risk from having HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for some medicines that can cause severe or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects , such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of International norm@@ alized R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the active concentration .
aspir@@ ase should be reduced to duration if a r@@ ash of system@@ ic or allergic symptoms are accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
an increased risk for a Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with pharmaceutical - 49 dependent factors such as a longer continuous anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy and associated met@@ abolic disorders .
in ha@@ em@@ oph@@ ile patients ( Type A and B ) , which were treated with prot@@ eases , reports on an increase of bleeding including the spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ oma and hem@@ mar@@ thro@@ sis occur .
it was shown that R@@ if@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r which can lead to an ast@@ rolog@@ ical failure and to a resistance development .
508 % increase if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) is administered in combination with Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
simultaneous in@@ gest@@ ion with A@@ gener@@ ase may increase their plasma cent@@ ri@@ cul@@ ations and lead to P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in conjunction with the resulting side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ ur@@ ities , visual distur@@ ban@@ ces and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
based on the data on 54 other CY@@ P3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am is significantly higher level of plasma concentration from Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
the potential risk for human beings is not known as A@@ gener@@ ase solution for use may not be applied during pregnancy due to possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us ( see section 4.3 ) .

the applic@@ ant frequency and duration of treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a depends on the treatment of treating Al@@ dar@@ a up to a maximum of 16 weeks a week . • In case of small bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma it is increased three times a week during one or two four @-@ week treatment cycles , with four weeks break between the treatment cycles , three times a week .
the cream is diluted in front of sleep @-@ type on the affected area surfaces so that they remain sufficient ( about eight hours ) on the skin before being washed .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was compared to placebo ( the same cream , but without the active substance ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies of 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area 16 weeks .
main indi@@ ces for the effectiveness was the number of patients treated with complete cure cancer . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also examined in two studies with small bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma in two studies and Al@@ dar@@ a or placebo was performed daily or five times a week .
main indi@@ ces for the effectiveness was the number of patients with complete healing of tum@@ ors after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies in a total of 50@@ 5 patients with acute kern@@ els .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than the placebo . • In case of treatment of war@@ ts in the genital area the full healing rate was treated from 66 % to 80 % with Al@@ dar@@ a patients treated with Al@@ dar@@ a treated patients compared to 0 % to 3 % in the placebo group .
the most common adverse events of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
clin@@ ically typical , non hyper@@ ker@@ at@@ otic , non hyper@@ tro@@ ph@@ ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis ( A@@ KS ) in the face or on the scal@@ p in immun@@ oph@@ thal@@ mic adults , if the size or the number of les@@ ions limit the efficacy and / or the acceptance of a cr@@ y@@ otherapy , or other top@@ ical treatment options are contra@@ indicated or less suitable .

the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is so long to continue , until all the visible inc@@ lin@@ ers have disappeared , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period .
an inter@@ ruption in the above treatment process should be considered if intensive local inflammation occur ( see section 4.4 ) or when an infection is observed .
if the follow @-@ up exam@@ inations ranged from 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period the les@@ ions were completely healed , a different therapy should be started ( see Section 4.4 ) .
if a dose was left out , the patient applied the cream until he / she noticed this and then continue with the usual therapeutic plan .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is worn in a thin layer and rub in the pur@@ ified , rub with folding war@@ ts infected skin area until the cream is completely covered .
in these patients there should be a weak@@ ening between the benefit of an treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , and the risk associated with a possible failure of its auto@@ immune disease .
in these patients there should be a weak@@ ening between the benefit of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , and the risk associated with a possible organ revol@@ t or Gra@@ ft @-@ versus @-@ host@@ - reaction .
in other studies , in which no daily stock levels were carried out , two cases of heavier ph@@ im@@ osis were observed and one case with one to circumc@@ ision .
in case an application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in higher than the recommended doses has a higher risk for heavy local skin irrit@@ ation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local skin irrit@@ ation were observed , which necessary treatment and / or a temporary physical imp@@ air@@ ment .
in cases where such reactions came at the exit of the ureth@@ ra , some women had trouble passing urine , which necessary emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area .
for the use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream directly following a treatment with other cut@@ aneous treatment methods for the treatment of external cow@@ ardi@@ ans in the genital and peripher@@ al area so far have no clinical experiences yet .
limited data suggest an increased rate of F@@ eig@@ war@@ ts reductions in HIV positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream has shown a lower efficacy in this patient group in relation to elim@@ ination of cow@@ ardi@@ ce .
treating the bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine within 1 cm to the eyel@@ ids , nose , lips , or the hair@@ line was not studied .
local skin reactions are common , but the intensity of these reactions proceed in general during the therapy or the reactions form after the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if it is necessary because of the dis@@ comfort of the patient or the sever@@ ity of the local skin reactions , a treatment break may be made of several days .
after the re@@ generation of the treated skin , the clinical results of the treatment can be judged approximately 12 weeks after the treatment .
since there are no data on long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months after treatment , other appropriate therapy forms should be considered .
in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated B@@ CC@@ s there are no clinical experiences , so the application is not recommended in previously treated tum@@ ors .
data from an open clinical study suggest that in large tum@@ ours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) , there is a lower probability of response to the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not investigated for treating ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis on eyel@@ ids , inside the nose or ears or on the lip zone within the lip @-@ r@@ ots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are only very limited data on the use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for treating ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis to anatom@@ ical areas outside the facial and the scal@@ p . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the available data about ak@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis in the fore@@ arms and hands support the effectiveness in this use case , therefore , such a application is not recommended .
local cre@@ w@@ actions occur frequently , but these reactions proceed normally in the course of the therapy at intensity or go back after placing the therapy with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if the local skin reactions may cause large un@@ eas@@ iness or very strong , treatment may be suspended for a few days .
from the data of an open clinical study , patients with more than 8 active les@@ ions had a less@@ er full healing rate referred to patients with fewer than 8 les@@ ions .
due to the immune stimul@@ ating properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be used in patients who receive an immun@@ os@@ u@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) .

in clinical trials to study the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ osis , Alo@@ pe@@ zie was observed with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment point or in the surrounding area .
the acci@@ dentally unique oral absorption of 200 mg I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the contents of about 16 bags , could cause nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , head@@ aches , my@@ algia and fever .
the clin@@ ically significant side effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , norm@@ alized in hyp@@ ot@@ onia , which norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous fluid .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , system@@ ic concentrations of the alpha inter@@ fer@@ ons and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected after the top@@ ical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od .
in 3 piv@@ ot@@ al phase 3 efficacy studies could be shown that the efficacy in relation to full healing of the cow@@ ardi@@ ce is clearly superior to a placebo treatment over 16 weeks of a placebo treatment .
in 60 % of all patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy @-@ treated patients were completely healed ; this was 20 % of 105 patients with placebo @-@ tested patients ( 95 % CI ) :
full healing was achieved at 23 % of 157 patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated male patients , compared with 5 % of 161 patients treated with placebo @-@ treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) :
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od in five @-@ time application per week over 6 weeks has been examined in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies .
the targets were hist@@ ologically confirmed individual primary super@@ vis@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
the data contained in an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years showed that about 7@@ 9.3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) &#93; of all treated patients were clin@@ ically cured , and that remained for 48 months .
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od with three weeks weekly use in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week period , has been studied in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies .
the patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non hyper@@ di@@ at@@ otic , non @-@ hyper@@ tropical acc@@ ru@@ ptions within a related 25 c@@ m2 great treatment area than on the hair@@ less scal@@ p or in the face .
results from two combined observ@@ ational studies indicate patients with clinical healing after one or two treatment periods of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) .
the approved indications of external f@@ eig@@ ne@@ tics , ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis and super@@ fi@@ zi@@ al bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma occur normally not on and were therefore not examined .
Al@@ dar@@ a cream has been studied in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled studies of children aged 2 to 15 years with m@@ oll@@ us@@ cum cont@@ ag@@ ios@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , placebo n = 3@@ 13 ) .
in these studies the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or for a period of ≤ 16 weeks .
a minimum system@@ ic recording of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream through the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis was observed during the three weekly use during 16 weeks .
the highest drug con@@ concentrations in ser@@ um at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and lived in the face in the face ( 12.5 mg , 1 disposable bags ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the calculated obvious half @-@ life was about 10@@ times higher than the 2 @-@ hour half @-@ time after sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in an earlier study ; it indicates an extended re@@ tention of the drug in the skin .
data to system@@ ic exposure showed that the Res@@ or@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was low in patients at the age of 6 - 12 years and comparable to that of healthy adults and adults with acute ker@@ at@@ osis or super @-@ targeted bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month study of der@@ mal tox@@ icity at the rat , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased sp@@ leen weight ; another four months carried out a study at the mouse yiel@@ ded no similar effects .
a two @-@ year study involving car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ icity in mice during three days a week induced no tum@@ ors at the application site .
the corresponding mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a small system@@ ic absorption of human skin and not mut@@ ages , is a risk for humans due to system@@ ic exposure as very low .
the tum@@ ors came in the group of mice , treated with the real @-@ free cr@@ ème , so@@ oner and in larger numbers than in the control group with low U@@ VR .

in the study , mainly the safety of the drug was investigated , however , its effectiveness measured ( by its effect in relation to reduction of g@@ ag concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver was studied ) .
in children under five years Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me killed the g@@ ag concentrations in the urine by approximately 60 % , and half of the treated children showed a normal big liver at the end of the study .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients at the age of over five years ( observed with more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , nau@@ sea , abdominal pain , ar@@ thr@@ al@@ o@@ arthritis ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in limbs ( in hands and feet ) , heat feeling , fever and reactions at the in@@ fusion point .
very common side effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( measuring size of lung function ) , speed@@ ometer ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not react sensiti@@ vely ( allergic ) on lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or one of the other components ( an@@ aphy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) , not applied .

the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is given to patients who observe alkal@@ az@@ y@@ me in terms of reactions to in@@ fusion and development of anti@@ bodies .
in June 2003 , the European Commission granted the company Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. author@@ ization for the transport of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me throughout the European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using Ch@@ o @-@ mam@@ mal cells ( Chinese Ham@@ ster O@@ vary , derived from the Chinese ham@@ sters ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme therapy in patients with secured diagnosis of a Mu@@ jah@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ ot I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non @-@ neurolog@@ ical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out by a physician , who owns the experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ ed@@ itary met@@ abolic diseases .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased when the patient is carrying out all 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 e / kg / h .
the safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined , and no dos@@ ing scheme can be recommended for these patients .
safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined , and for these patients no dos@@ ing scheme can be recommended .
patients treated with alkal@@ az@@ y@@ me can develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions which are defined as each associated with effect , which occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion process ( see section 4.8 ) .
for this reason , especially those patients should continue to be closely monitored , and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be made available in a reasonable clinical environment , where re@@ vit@@ ational facilities for medical emergen@@ cies are available .
due to the clinical phase 3 study , almost all patients Ig@@ G anti@@ bodies against Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase are generally formed , usually within 3 months from treatment .
patients who develop anti@@ bodies or symptoms of in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution ( see sections 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
because little experience in res@@ um@@ ption of treatment after a leng@@ thy dis@@ ruption , has to be careful due to the theoretical risk reaction after an inter@@ ruption of treatment .
60 minutes before the beginning of in@@ fusion with medication ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and / or anti@@ py@@ her@@ ka ) to minim@@ ize the potential occurrence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
in case of an easy or moderate in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the treatment of anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen was to be considered and / or a reduction in the in@@ fusion rate to the half of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
in case of a single , severe in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are brought to decline , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is weak@@ ened .
the in@@ fusion can be resumed with a reduction in the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate when the reaction occurred .
3 ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ ids ) and a reduction in the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate , occurring in the previous reaction .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be applied at the same time with chlor@@ o@@ quin or Proc@@ ain , because there is a potential risk of in@@ ference with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular surface of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
experimental studies do not depend on direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , the embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
since there are no data to new@@ bor@@ ns that exposed to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , above the breast milk , it is recommended to breast@@ feeding the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
the effects of clinical trials were mainly classified as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions which were observed in 53 % of patients in phase 3 study ( treatment duration of up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients with participants under 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) .
undes@@ i@@ rable drug inter@@ actions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me that were observed during the Phase 3 study and its extension in a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 or older in a treatment duration of up to 4 years ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related participation of the upper respir@@ atory system and lungs in pre@@ history , moreover , severe reactions came up , including bron@@ chos@@ pas@@ m , respir@@ atory and visual acu@@ ity ( see section 4.4 ) .
children un@@ desired drug inter@@ actions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me that were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients in the age of 5 , with mainly heavy traffic form and a duration of treatment up to 12 months , listed in the table .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
in most patients , patients received a ser@@ um version during the age of 3 months , with a severe van@@ ishing form mostly in the age of 5 years ( average after 26 days over 45 days with patients at the age of 5 and older ) .
by the end of the Phase 3 study ( or until a premature retirement from the study ) , there were no stra@@ ble anti@@ bodies for 13 / 45 patients ( R@@ IP ) As@@ say demon@@ stra@@ ble anti@@ bodies , among them 3 patients with which it never appeared to ser@@ o@@ on@@ ates .
patients with inf@@ ant until low anti @-@ antibody mirrors have been demonstrated to a robust reductions in the g@@ ag , while patients with high antibody tit@@ res was a variable reduction of G@@ ag in the Har@@ n .
four patients ( three in the phase 3 study and one in the Phase 2 study ) showed a mar@@ g@@ inal and low @-@ neutr@@ alising effect on the enz@@ ym@@ atic Lar@@ on@@ id@@ as@@ e- activity in vitro , which seemed to affect clinical efficacy and / or the reduction of G@@ ag in the urine .
the presence of anti@@ bodies seemed not to be associated with the incidence of undes@@ ired pharmac@@ euticals , even if the occurrence of adverse drug reactions might typically fall together with the formation of Ig@@ G anti @-@ anti@@ bodies .
reas@@ oning for the enzyme is in one for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated sub@@ str@@ ates and preventing further accumulation of an enzyme .
after intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is quickly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the ly@@ ph@@ os@@ omes , most likely about man@@ ic @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors .
safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were random@@ ised in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled phase 3 study to 45 patients at the age of 6 to 43 years .
although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , the majority of patients were identified by the mean phen@@ otype and a patient showed the heavy phen@@ otype .
patients were recru@@ ited when they had a for@@ c@@ ted exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the value expected and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute test .
all patients were then recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study , where they received 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me every week ( 182 weeks ) .
after 26 weeks of therapy the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me treated an improvement of lung function and the hearing on which is shown in the following table .
the open renewal study showed an improvement and / or maintaining these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and 182 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group as shown in the following table .
the decrease of the expected percentage of FE@@ V is not significant over this period of clin@@ ically significant and absolute lung @-@ volumes increased significantly to the height of body @-@ growing children .

within the first 4 weeks , a significant drop of the G@@ ag levels in the Har@@ n ( µ@@ g / mg of Cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine ) was observed , which remained constant until the study .
regarding the hetero@@ gene@@ ous disease manifest@@ ation between the patients suffering from a combined end point , clin@@ ically significant changes in the 6 @-@ minute walk test , movement of the shoulder blade ancest@@ i and visual acu@@ ity ) was generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 22 % ) and a deteri@@ oration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a one year old open phase 2 study was conducted , mainly the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in 20 patients who were enrolled at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years ( 16 patients with severe form @-@ form and 4 ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg due to increased G@@ AG@@ - mirrors in the Har@@ n in week 22 .
in several patients , a size of size ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) and all 4 patients with the mean follow @-@ up form demonstrated a normal mental development speed , whereas the elderly patients were limited to a limited , limited or no progress in cognitive development .
in a Phase 4 study , research into pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics effects of various Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dos@@ ing schem@@ ata were carried out on the g@@ ag levels in the Har@@ n , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dos@@ ing scheme with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can be found in patients who have difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions , however , is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical efficacy of these two do@@ si@@ zing schem@@ ata is equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will provide any new information available , rate annually , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the drug may be updated .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients under the age of 5 was similar to those in elderly and less affected patients .

Ali@@ m@@ ta is used together with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in ( another drug against cancer ) when the cancer is not re@@ se@@ eable &quot; ( mal@@ ign@@ ant - cancer ) has already spread to other parts of the body or spreads easily to other parts of the body . • advanced or metastatic &quot; non @-@ cell lung cancer that does not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epithel@@ ium cells .
Ali@@ m@@ ta is used in patients who previously had not been treated in combination with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in and in patients who previously already received other chem@@ otherap@@ ies than therapy .
to reduce side effects , patients should be taken during the treatment with Ali@@ m@@ ta a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( vitamin C ) and injec@@ tions of vitamin B12 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when Ali@@ m@@ ta is given together with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti@@ em@@ e@@ tik@@ um &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( medicine against vom@@ iting ) and liquids should be given in addition to the gift of c@@ is@@ plat@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in patients whose bleeding problems occur , or where certain other side effects occur , treatment should be pushed down , or the dose should be reduced .
the active form of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed slow@@ ed thus the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells .
the conversion of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ bo@@ xed into its active form is easier to fit in cancer cells than in healthy cells , resulting in higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer duration in cancer cells .
in a main study of 4@@ 56 patients , Ali@@ m@@ ta was investig@@ ating the treatment of mal@@ ign@@ ant pic@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ oma who had previously received no chemotherapy against their disease before .
in the treatment of non @-@ cell lung cancer , the effects of Ali@@ m@@ ta in a study were compared to 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease previously compared to the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another drug against cancer ) .
in addition , Ali@@ m@@ ta was compared with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another drug against cancer ) , both in combination with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously had no chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients who were treated with Ali@@ m@@ ta and C@@ is@@ plat@@ in survived an average of 12.@@ 1 months compared to 9.3 months compared to C@@ is@@ plat@@ in .
in patients who previously had previously received chemotherapy , the average survival time with Ali@@ m@@ ta was 8.3 months compared to doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
in both studies , however , patients with cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epithel@@ ium cells , during the administration of Ali@@ m@@ ta longer survival compared to the compar@@ ative medicine .
in September 2004 the European Commission adopted the company Eli Lilly Neder@@ land B.@@ V. author@@ ization for the transport of Ali@@ m@@ ta in the whole European Union .
each pier@@ cing bottle has to be suspended with 4.@@ 2 ml 0,@@ 9 % sodium chloride injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary Do@@ or S@@ IS is collected and diluted with 0,@@ 9 % sodium chloride injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.6 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is displayed in combination with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ ch@@ ial cell car@@ cin@@ oma ( see section 5.1 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA in Mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with Lo@@ - K@@ al advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ ch@@ ial cell car@@ cin@@ oma ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² of body surface ( KO@@ F ) administered intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 day treatment course .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ plat@@ in is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as in@@ fusion about a period of 2 hours about 30 minutes after graduation of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion the first day of each 21 day treatment course .
in patients with non @-@ cell bron@@ ch@@ ial cell car@@ cin@@ oma following previous @-@ previous chemotherapy the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 day treatment course .
reduction of the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions must be given the day before and on the day of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed gift as well as on the day following treatment a cor@@ ti@@ ost@@ ero@@ id .
during the seven days prior to the first dose , P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed must be taken at least 5 doses fo@@ lic acid and the intake must be continued during the entire duration of treatment as well as for another 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose .
patients must also receive an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection of vitamin B12 ( 1000 mc@@ g ) in the week before the first P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed dose , as well as after every third handling cycle .
in patients who receive p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ bo@@ xed , a complete blood picture should be created before every gift , including a differentiation of the leu@@ ko@@ cytes and a plat@@ el@@ bow .
alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ anine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ GP@@ T ) should amount to ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment course , dos@@ ing test must be held under rec@@ tification of the N@@ adi@@ r blood balance or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity of the previous therapy cycles .
after recovery , patients need to be treated according to critics in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , to use AL@@ IM@@ TA as a mon@@ otherapy or in combination with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in .
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ icity Crit@@ eria ( CT@@ C v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ CT@@ C degree 2 blood supply .
patients should not develop non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity ) , treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be interrupted by the patient for the treatment
treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be canc@@ eled when patients with 2 dose @-@ reduc@@ tive tox@@ icity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - on the appearance of Grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
clinical studies show no indication that in patients at the age of 65 years or in comparison to patients in the age of 65 years , an elevated side @-@ risk is established .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to adequate data for un@@ question@@ able and efficacy .
in clinical studies , patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min were not necessary to go out with dose adjustments to all patients recommended .
the data situation in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with liver function limits of &gt; to the 1.5 times of the upper bili@@ ru@@ bin@@ - limit value and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values of &gt; to the top not@@ ion of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5.0 times of the upper limit ( when the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not specifically investigated in studies .
patients need to be monitored in regard to the bone @-@ market supp@@ ression and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ bo@@ xed may not be given to patients , before their absolute Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ wer count again att@@ ained a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the plat@@ el@@ - cy@@ te number once again reached a value of ≥ 100.000 cells / mm ³ .
a dose of dos@@ ing for further cycles is based on the N@@ adir of absolute Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ wer &apos;s and maximum non @-@ ugly tox@@ icity as they were observed in the previous treatment cycles - ( see Section 4.2 ) .
a lower tox@@ icity and a reduction of degrees 3 / 4 of hem@@ at@@ ological and non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity as ne@@ ut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ r@@ ile ne@@ ut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and infection with grade 3 / 4 ne@@ ut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie was in@@ tox@@ icated when a pre@@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place .
therefore all patients treated with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed patients need to use fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B12 as a proph@@ yl@@ actic measure to reduce treatment @-@ related tox@@ icity ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to medium @-@ sized kidney failure ( N@@ SA@@ IDs ) such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ s@@ ali@@ - c@@ yl@@ lei@@ c acid ( &gt; 1,3 g daily ) for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and mind@@ fulness of patients ( see section 4.5 ) .
all patients who are intended for therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed are to intake N@@ SA@@ IDs a long half @-@ day for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy ( see section 4.5 ) .
many patients during which these events emerged , had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing hypertension or diabetes .
therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid collection , drainage of the result should be considered a drainage of the result before p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed treatment .
5 Major cardi@@ ov@@ ascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were reported in clinical trials with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed occasionally when this ingredient was usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance .
for this reason , the simultaneous use of atten@@ u@@ ated live vaccine ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
as the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage caused by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , men should be pointed out before the treatment - G@@ inn to get advice regarding the sperm serv@@ itude .
in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) , high doses of non @-@ ster@@ oid antibiot@@ ic acid ( N@@ SA@@ IDs , such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses ( ≥ 1.3 g daily ) to a reduced breakdown of adverse events .
therefore caution is advis@@ able if patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) can be used high doses of N@@ SA@@ IDs or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ lei@@ c acid in high doses .
I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in a high dosage for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and mind@@ fulness of patients ( see section 4.4 ) .
because there are no data regarding the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ IDs with long h@@ emisph@@ ere , such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous use of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed for at least 2 days prior to therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - should be avoided .
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the basis status during the illness and the possibility of interaction between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplast@@ y chemotherapy demands an increased surveillance frequency of IN@@ R ( International norm@@ alised debt ) when the decision was made to treat patients with oral anti@@ an@@ an@@ ism .
there are no data for using P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed during pregnant women , but as at an@@ de@@ - an@@ timet@@ abol@@ ites are expected to occur in pregnancy heavy @-@ birth defects .
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed should not be applied during pregnancy , except if absolutely Re@@ quired and after careful retri@@ ation of the use@@ fulness for the mother and risk for the fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) .
as the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage caused by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , men should be pointed out before treatment , consulting regarding the sperm cell .
it is not known whether P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ bo@@ xed to the breast milk and undes@@ i@@ rable effects of the increased inf@@ ant can not be excluded .

AL@@ IM@@ TA ( P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ) is an ant@@ ine@@ ar anti@@ fol@@ ate , which practices its effect by interrup@@ ting fol@@ ate met@@ abolic processes that are necessary for cell rep@@ lication .
in vitro studies show that P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed as anti@@ fol@@ ate affects more attack points , by blocking the thy@@ mid@@ yl@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ ase ( TS ) , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ fol@@ ate reduc@@ t@@ v@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ase ( TS ) , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ fol@@ ate reduc@@ t@@ v@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ase ( G@@ AR@@ FT ) , the fol@@ ate @-@ dependent key enzymes in the de Nov@@ o Bios@@ yn@@ thesis of Thy@@ mid@@ in- and Pur@@ inn@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ os .
E@@ MP@@ H@@ AC@@ IS , a multi @-@ centric , random@@ ized , simple @-@ blind stage 3 study of AL@@ IM@@ TA plus c@@ is@@ plat@@ in treated patients with mal@@ ign@@ ant pic@@ il@@ am@@ es@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ om showed that patients with AL@@ IM@@ TA and C@@ is@@ plat@@ in treated patients were clin@@ ically significant compared to those patients suffering just c@@ is@@ plat@@ in .
the primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients treated in the treatment arm ( random@@ ised and treated ) .
a statist@@ ically significant improvement of clinical symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ nea ) was shown in connection with the mal@@ ign@@ ant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ om in the AL@@ IM@@ TA / C@@ is@@ plat@@ in arm ( 212 patients ) compared to the sole C@@ is@@ pl@@ a- T@@ in arm ( 218 patients ) .
the differences between the two arms are given through an improvement of lung function parameters in AL@@ IM@@ TA / C@@ is@@ plat@@ in arm and a deteri@@ oration of lung function throughout the time in control .
a multi @-@ centric , random@@ ised , open phase III trial with AL@@ IM@@ TA against doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el in patients treated with locally advanced or metastatic NSC@@ LC coming to previously untreated patients ( in@@ fusion to Tre@@ at Population n = 28@@ 3 ) and 7.9 months with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el treated patients ( ITT n = 288 ) .
an analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on treatment effect on the treatment effect fell to favor of AL@@ IM@@ TA in patients with NSC@@ LC in favour of d@@ ox@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( n = 172 , 6.2 versus 7.4 months , adapted HR = 1.@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1,@@ 08 @-@ 2,@@ 26 , p = 0.0@@ 18 ) .
limited data of a separately random@@ ised , controlled phase 3 study show that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) for p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed between patients ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 540 ) are similar to doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
the efficacy analysis of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analyses of ITT population and support the non @-@ su@@ peri@@ ority of AL@@ IM@@ TA C@@ is@@ plat@@ in combination compared to gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine C@@ is@@ plat@@ in combination .
mean PFS was 4.8 months for the combination of gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine C@@ is@@ plat@@ in ( adjusted HR = 1,@@ 04 ; 95 % CI = 0.@@ 94 - 1.@@ 15 ) , the overall response rate was 30.@@ 6 % ( 95 % CI = 25.@@ 0 - 3@@ 1.4 ) for the combination of gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine C@@ is@@ plat@@ in .
analysis of the influence of NSC@@ LC Hist@@ ology in the survival showed clin@@ ically relevant sub @-@ differences according to hist@@ ology , see table below .

dissolve the contents of the 500 mg @-@ through@@ put bottles with 20 ml 0,@@ 9 % sodium chloride ( 9 mg / ml ) without preservatives , resulting in a solution with a concentrate of about 25 mg / ml .
the resulting solution is clear and the colour@@ ing ranges from color@@ less to yellow or green , without imp@@ aired the pro@@ - du@@ kt@@ al quality .
it is used in overweight adults with a body mass index ( Body Mass Index - BMI ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter in conjunction with a low @-@ cal@@ orie , low @-@ fat diet .
patients who can take all@@ i and have no weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if these enzymes are in@@ hibited , they cannot build some fats in the food , thus avoiding a quarter of the fats supplied with the food .
in a third study , all@@ i was compared with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with placebo in 3@@ 91 .
in both studies of patients with a BMI of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who had all@@ i 60 mg had an average weight loss of 4.8 kg , compared with 2.3 kg when taking placebo .
the study with all@@ i in patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 could not be observed for the patient &apos;s relevant weight loss .
the most common side effects of all@@ i ( observed with more than 1 of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily spots on the anus , fl@@ atus ( winds ) with sto@@ ols , chair volume , o@@ ily / o@@ ily stool , waste water ( wind ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( wind ) and soft chairs .
it must not be applied to patients suffering from Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent the organs of transplan@@ tation ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
furthermore , it may not be used in patients suffering from a long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( where not enough nutrients are taken from the digest@@ ive tract ) or to cholesterol ( liver illness ) , and with pregnant or breast@@ feeding mothers .
in July 2007 , the European Commission adopted the company G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited with approval for the transport of or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K in the whole European Union .
all@@ i is inde@@ xed to weight reduction of adults with overweight ( Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) , and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ kal@@ ine , o@@ ily pur@@ ified nutrition .
all@@ i should not be applied by children and young@@ sters under 18 , since there is no sufficient data for efficacy and safety .
however , since or@@ list@@ at is only minim@@ ally res@@ or@@ ated , there is no adaptation of the dosage with reduced liver and / or kidney function .
• Over@@ sensitivity to the active substance or one of the other components • simultaneous treatment with Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see section 4.5 ) • Pre@@ par@@ ation time ( see Section 4.6 ) • Pre@@ par@@ ation period ( see section 4.6 ) • Equ@@ al treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ bodies ( see sections 4.5 and 4.8 )
the probability of occurrence of gast@@ ro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.8 ) can be taken if all@@ i is taken together with a rich single meal or o@@ ily diet .
as the weight reduction in diabetes may lead to improved met@@ abolic control , patients should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before the start of a therapy with all@@ i , because the dosage of the anti@@ di@@ abe@@ tic may be adjusted .
patients who take all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or higher cholesterol , should consult their doctor or pharmac@@ ist if the dosage of these medicines must be adjusted .
it is recommended to meet additional fluctu@@ ating measures in order to prevent the possible failure of oral contrac@@ ep@@ tions ( see section 4.5 ) .
both in a study on exchange effects of medicines and in several cases with the same application of or@@ list@@ at and Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in a decrease of Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma was observed .
if using war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ bodies in combination with or@@ list@@ at the Quick @-@ Val@@ ues ( International norm@@ aliz@@ able , IN@@ R ) could be affected ( see section 4.8 ) .
in most patients who were treated with or@@ list@@ at in clinical trials up to 4 full years , the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K and beta @-@ car@@ ot@@ ins remained in the normal range .
however , the patient should be recommended to take a supple@@ mentary mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin pre@@ par@@ ate to ensure adequate vit@@ amine intake ( see section 4.4 ) .
based on the gift of one @-@ time dose of A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on , a minor decrease in the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on plasma concentration was observed at the same time .
experimental studies showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gast@@ ro@@ intestinal natural and hanging with the pharmac@@ ological effects of the drug , as the absorption of captured fat is prevented .
the gast@@ ro@@ intestinal side effects were obtained from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a duration of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporarily .
the frequencies are defined as follows : very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) and very rare ( frequency based on available data is not estimated ) .
the incidence of known adverse events that were noted after the market launch of or@@ list@@ at is not known since these events were voluntarily reported by a population of some extent .
† It is plau@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i can lead to anxiety related to possible or actual gast@@ ro@@ intestinal effects .
single doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple outlets of up to 400 mg three times daily were administered over a period of 15 days to normal and overweight subjects without any significant clinical findings .
in the majority of or@@ list@@ at over@@ dose , either side @-@ effects or similar side effects were reported on either side effects , such as the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at .
based on investigations on human and animal , system@@ ic effects can be derived from a quick reg@@ ression of any system@@ ic effects , which are attri@@ but@@ able to the li@@ pas@@ ian properties of or@@ list@@ at .
the therapeutic effect takes place in the l@@ umen of Mag@@ ens and the upper thin @-@ intest@@ ine by co@@ valent bonds to the active Ser@@ in @-@ Rest of the gast@@ ric and pan@@ cre@@ atic li@@ pas@@ en .
from clinical trials , that 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at was taken three times a day , the absorption of approximately 25 % of the food fet@@ ch is blocked .
two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , placebo @-@ controlled trials to adults with a BMI of 28 kg / m2 provides the efficacy of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times daily in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ ine , fet@@ al feeding nutrition .
the primary parameter , the change of body weight compared to the output value ( at the time of Rand@@ om@@ ization ) , was evaluated as follows : as a proportion of the body weight in the study ( Table 1 ) and as a proportion of participants of study participants , which have lost more than 10 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight loss ( Table 2 ) .
although the weight reduction was observed for 12 months in both studies , the biggest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months .
the average change in the total chol@@ est@@ erin was 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( output value 5,@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 2.8 % ( output value 5,@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change of LD@@ L cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( output value 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 3.8 % ( output value 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
in the wa@@ ist circum@@ ference , the average change of -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( output value of 10@@ 3,7 cm ) and with placebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( output value is 10@@ 3,5 cm ) .
plasma cent@@ ri@@ cul@@ ations of non @-@ met@@ alli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not measur@@ able 8 hours after the oral application of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 n@@ g / ml ) .
7 In general , with therapeutic doses not met@@ alli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at , plasma could only be spor@@ adic and at extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 n@@ g / ml , or 0,@@ 02 µ@@ l ) and without signs of cum@@ ulation .
in a study of obes@@ e patients with minimal res@@ or@@ tive dose , two main met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed dose could be identified , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ l@@ ysi@@ zed Lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 after graduation of the N @-@ Form@@ yl @-@ Leu@@ c@@ ine group ) , which demonstrated almost 42 % of the total plasma concentration .
based on conventional studies in safety har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity with repeated gift , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity , can@@ o@@ gene@@ ous potential and reproduction , the pre @-@ clinical data can not recognize any special danger to humans .

the most common adverse events related to the effects of the capsules and thereby causes that the fat is ex@@ cre@@ ted out of the body .
these side effects occur usually within the first weeks after treatment , since you may not have been system@@ atically reduced to the amount of fat in the diet .
with the following basic rules you can learn to minim@@ ize the nutritional @-@ related com@@ it@@ ations : • Beg@@ in a few days , or better a week before taking the usual fat content of your favorite food and over the size of portions you usually take .
if you know exactly how much you eat , the odds that you exceed your fat limit . • Share your recommended amount evenly on daily meals .
save the amount of calories and fat that you may take per meal , do not take care of having done it in the form of a fat @-@ rich court or of a restra@@ ined night court or to experience it in other programs . • Most people in which these guides will occur to control these with the time by adjusting their diet .
• Do not store medicines for children . • Do not store any more than 25 ° C after the case laid down on the box office . • The container holds two white sealed containers with si@@ lic@@ a@@ gel that serve capsules dry .
do not swal@@ low this in any case . • You can manage your daily dose of all@@ i in the blue transport box ( Shuttle ) to get that of this pack .

overweight has influence on your health and increases the risk for the emergence of different serious diseases such as : • hypertension • diabetes • cereb@@ ral diseases • cereb@@ ral cancer • oste@@ o@@ arthritis speaking to your doctor about your risk for these diseases .
a permanent weight loss , for instance by improving the diet and more movement , can prevent suffering from serious diseases and has a positive influence on your health .
choose meals that contain a wide range of nutrients and learn to feed ourselves healthy .
energy is also measured in kilo@@ j@@ oules , which you can also find as indic@@ ating on the packaging of food . • The recommended cal@@ orie intake indicates how many calories you should take up to each day .
note down the tables below in this section . • The recommended amount of fat in grams is the maximum amount of fat that you should take with each meal .
which amount is suitable for you , refer to the information below , which is the number of calories available to you , which is essential for you . • Due to the mode of action , the observ@@ ance of the recommended fat is decisive .
if you take the same amount of fat like so far , this can mean that your body can &apos;t process this amount of fat .
to maxim@@ ize the recommended fat , you can maxim@@ ize weight loss and at the same time the lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood of nutrition @-@ related com@@ promises . • You should try to decrease gradually and continuously .
34 This reduced cal@@ orie intake should enable you to gradually lose weight and continuously lose about 0.5 kg per week , without developing fru@@ str@@ ations and disappoin@@ tments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the more active you are , the higher your recommended cal@@ orie intake is . • &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; low physical activity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that you burn daily at least 150 kcal , for example by 3 km walk , 30@@ - to 45 minute garden work or 2 km running in 15 minutes . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Alo@@ xi is used for chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the strong trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( like C@@ is@@ plat@@ in ) , as well as chemotherapy ; the excessive trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting are ( like cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , D@@ ox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or car@@ b@@ op@@ lat@@ in ) .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi can be increased by the additional gift of a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ ids ( a drug that can be used as anti@@ em@@ e@@ tics ) .
for patients under 18 years of age it is not recommended to provide enough information about the effects in this age group .
this means that the substance prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ otonin ) to prevent the recept@@ ors in the bo@@ wel .
Alo@@ xi was examined in three main studies of 1 8@@ 42 adult , chem@@ otherap@@ ies received strong or moderate trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting .
for chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the strong trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting are , 59 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi were no vom@@ iting ( 132 by 223 ) , compared with 57 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 221 ) .
at Chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the moderate trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting are , 81 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi were no vom@@ iting ( 153 from 189 ) , compared with 69 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 from 185 ) .
in a comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for al@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 from 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission adopted the company in Helsinki Bi@@ rex Pharmaceuticals Ltd . a permit for the transport of Alo@@ xi within the whole European Union .
Alo@@ xi is inde@@ xed : for prevention of acute nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting with severe chemotherapy because of cancer illness and prevention of nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting with moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer illness .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi to prevention of nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , induced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy can be enhanced by adding a Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ ids due to chemotherapy .
since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the col@@ on @-@ ass@@ ure , patients should be monitored with am@@ nesty fruit ip@@ ation or signs of a sub@@ acro@@ some I@@ le@@ us after injection .
as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 ant@@ agon@@ ists , however , caution is advis@@ able for the same gift of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the QT interval or in patients with which the Q@@ t- interval is extended or those tend to increase .
besides a further chem@@ otherap@@ eutic gift Alo@@ xi is to be used in the days following chemotherapy or for the treatment of nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting .
in pre @-@ clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron not tum@@ bled against tum@@ ors ( C@@ is@@ plat@@ in , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ tar@@ ab@@ in , d@@ ox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) .
in a clinical study , there was no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a unique intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a ste@@ ady @-@ static concentration of a CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors .
in a population based pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis showed that the simultaneous gift of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 In@@ hibit@@ ors ( am@@ eth@@ yl@@ ine , c@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , c@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , c@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , kn@@ it@@ ine , kn@@ on@@ avi@@ r , Ser@@ tr@@ ine and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant impact on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experiences on the application of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ ancies not occur , so Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be applied in pregnant women unless it is considered necessary by the treat@@ able doctor .
clinical trials were the most common in a dose of 250 micro@@ grams ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) which were at least possibly associated with Alo@@ xi in connection , head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and fruit ip@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions on the Board of Performance ( burning , curing , dis@@ comfort and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing experience .
in the group with the highest dose there were similar frequencies of adverse events such as in the other lec@@ tic groups ; there were no dose of action to observe .
there were no di@@ aly@@ sis studies carried out due to the large distribution volume , however , a di@@ aly@@ sis is probably no effective therapy with an al@@ oe super@@ dose .
in two random@@ ised double blind@@ ness studies were received in total of 1.@@ 132 patients who received a moderate @-@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 of d@@ ox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mg / m2 d@@ ox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mg / m2 d@@ ox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in ( half @-@ time 7.3 hours ) , given to Day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one intraven@@ ously .
in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study , a total of 6@@ 67 patients who received a strongly @-@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 of cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and d@@ ac@@ ar@@ b@@ azine as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ gram pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron received patients who received 32 mg on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron , which were given to Day 1 intraven@@ ously .
results of studies with moderate chemotherapy and the study with strongly @-@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summar@@ ized in the following tables .
in clinical studies , chemotherapy @-@ induced nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) were similar to the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters , including the corresponding effects of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
according to the findings of clinical investigations , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron possesses the ability to block the I@@ on@@ en@@ can@@ als involved in vent@@ ric@@ ular De@@ - and Rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and to extend the duration of the action potential .
the aim of the study involved in 221 healthy subjects was the assessment of the EC@@ G @-@ effects of I.@@ v. administered in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0,@@ 75 and 2,@@ 25 mg .
Res@@ or@@ ption after intraven@@ ous gift follows an initial decrease of Plas@@ ma@@ i@@ ent@@ ations a slow elim@@ ination from the body with an average termin@@ ale half @-@ time of about 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the area under the concentration @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally in the entire dose of dose of 0.@@ 3- 90 μ g / kg with but@@ aries and cancer patient dos@@ is@@ proportional .
according to the intraven@@ ous gift of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0,@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 cans , the mean medium ( ± SD ) increase in Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34 % .
from pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic sim@@ ulations that once more than one @-@ day intraven@@ ous gift received from 0.@@ 25 mg pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on 3 consecutive days , total exports ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) was comparable with the one @-@ time intraven@@ ous administration of 0,@@ 75 mg , however , the C@@ max after one @-@ time ratio was 0.@@ 75 mg higher .
approximately 40 % are eliminated about the kidneys , and another 50 % are converted into two primary metabol@@ ites , compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on less than 1 % of the ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 recept@@ or .
in @-@ vitro studies for met@@ abolic processes have shown that CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 have been involved in the metabolism of the pal@@ abol@@ ism of the pal@@ abol@@ ism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elim@@ ination After a intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , about 80 % of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine , p@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as un@@ altered drug made about 40 % of the given dose .
after a unique intraven@@ ous bolt / in@@ ject , the total body of 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
while patients with severe liver function , the terminal elim@@ ination cycle time and the average system@@ ic exposure to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron is increased , however , a reduction of the dose is not justified .
in pre @-@ clinical studies effects were observed only after ex@@ positions that are considered sufficient over the maximum human therapeutic exposure , which indicates a low relev@@ ance to clinical use .
10 From pre @-@ clinical studies , indications that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block in very high concentrations of ion channels that are involved in the vent@@ ric@@ ular De@@ - and Rep@@ ol@@ ari@@ zation .
high doses Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose correspon@@ ded to about 30 times of therapeutic exposure to humans ) , which were given daily over two years , led to an increased frequency of liver tum@@ ors , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ op@@ las@@ ma ( in thy@@ ro@@ id , p@@ itu@@ itary , pan@@ cre@@ as , side ni@@ er@@ en@@ mark ) and skin tum@@ ors in rats , but not mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but because of the widely used doses and since Alo@@ xi is determined for unique application , the relev@@ ance of these results is very low in humans .

in June 2006 , the Committee on Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) approved a negative expertise in which the author@@ ization of approval for the treatment of hepat@@ itis C are provided by Alp@@ he@@ on 6 million IE / ml injection solution .
this means that Alp@@ he@@ on a biological medicine called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A should be similar to the same practical component that is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; reference drug &quot; ) .
Alp@@ he@@ on should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepat@@ itis C ( one by virus infection caused by virus infection ) .
a micro@@ scop@@ ic investigation indicates the liver tissue damage , in addition , the values of the liver enz@@ ec@@ otrop@@ ot@@ ran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are increased in the blood .
it is produced by a yeast into which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which contributes to the formation of the active ingredient .
the manufacturers of Alp@@ he@@ on made data that demonstrate the comparison of Alp@@ he@@ on with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( active structure , composition , and purity of the drug , mode of action , safety and effectiveness in hepat@@ itis C ) .
in the study on patients with Hepatitis C the efficacy of Alp@@ he@@ on &apos;s effectiveness was compared to 4@@ 55 patients .
the study was measured how many patients received after 12 of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after adjusting the treatment to the drug ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int htt@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © EMEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is the greatest concerns that promp@@ ted CH@@ MP to make the approval for the traffic ?
in addition , concern was clearly expressed that data on the stability of the active ingredient and the drug may not suff@@ ice .
the number of patients with Hepatitis C demonstrated on treatment with Alp@@ he@@ on and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , was similar in clinical study .
after setting the treatment with Alp@@ he@@ on , the disease with@@ stands for more patients than at the reference drug ; moreover , Alp@@ he@@ on had more side effects .
in addition , the test developed in the study was to investig@@ ate how far the medication was immune response ( i.e. the body forms anti@@ bodies - special proteins - against the drug ) , not adequ@@ ately vali@@ dated .
it can be used for the treatment of Im@@ pe@@ ti@@ go ( one with cru@@ sten@@ osis ) and small in@@ uni@@ denti@@ fied in@@ firm@@ ities ( R@@ iss@@ ing or s@@ wis@@ doms ) , di@@ ced and se@@ wn wounds .
Al@@ lo@@ go should not be used to treat infections that have been demon@@ stra@@ bly or presumably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ cocc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Alar@@ go may not affect this kind of infections .
Al@@ lo@@ go can be applied in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under 18 years the skin surface should not exceed 2 % of the body surface .
if the patient does not respond to treatment for two to three days , the physician should investig@@ ate the patient and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking the bacterial rift ( the parts of bacteria , in which proteins are produced ) and reduces the growth of bacteria .
main indi@@ ces of efficacy was in all five studies of the patients whose infection was cancelled after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.@@ 6 % ) 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2,1 % ) of 71 patients were treated under placebo for the treatment .
in the treatment of infected area @-@ dogs , Al@@ lo@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response : when the results were taken apart from both clinical studies , about 90 % of patients were enrolled in both groups of treatment .
in these two studies , however , that alt@@ ar@@ go was detected in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( sin@@ cer@@ ated cav@@ ities in body tissue ) or of infections that have been demon@@ stra@@ bly or presumably caused by MR@@ SA .
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a irrit@@ ation to the contrac@@ tor .
the conclusion that the benefits of human medicines ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of alt@@ ar@@ go in the short @-@ term treatment of the following superf@@ icial skin infections has to prevail against the risks : • Im@@ pe@@ ti@@ go , • infected small lazy , dra@@ fts or se@@ wn wounds .
in May 2007 the European Commission granted the company G@@ lax@@ o Group Ltd . , a permit for the traffic of Al@@ tar@@ go in the whole European Union .
patients who have no improvement within two to three days should be examined once more and an alternative therapy is considered to be considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
in case of lower@@ ing or severe local irrit@@ ation by the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ ine the treatment is canc@@ eled , the oint@@ ment carefully wi@@ ped out and an appropriate alternative therapy of infection are started .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is not used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known as path@@ ogen or susp@@ ects ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical studies , secondary wounds caused the effectiveness of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ cocc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) .
alternative therapy is to be considered , if a 2- or 3 @-@ day treatment is no improvement or deteri@@ oration of the infected place .
the impact of simultaneous use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical means on the same skin surface is not studied and the simultaneous application of other top@@ ical drugs is not recommended .
due to the low plasma cent@@ ri@@ cul@@ ations caused by people after top@@ ical use , a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition is not expected to be expected in vivo ( see section 5.2 ) .
3 After the simultaneous gift of 2 times daily 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole the average Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max after top@@ ical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ ine increased on a reduced skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
due to the small system@@ ic exposure after top@@ ical application in patients , dos@@ is@@ iz@@ ations are not kept for necessary when top@@ ical ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is applied during a system@@ ic treatment with CY@@ P3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a Re@@ productive function of oral in@@ tox@@ icity and are in@@ adequate in terms of a statement on the birth and the federal state / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ ine should be used during pregnancy , when a top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly inde@@ xed and the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is the gift of a system@@ ic antibiot@@ ic .
by decision whether the breast@@ feeding continued / termin@@ ated or termin@@ ated with Al@@ tar@@ go is concluded between the benefit of a halt for the inf@@ ant and the benefit of the Al@@ lo@@ go therapy for the woman .
in clinical studies of 2@@ 150 patients with superf@@ icial skin infections that Al@@ tar@@ go have been applied , the most commonly reported side effects of Ir@@ rit@@ ation , which affects approximately 1 % of the patients .
mode of action Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ atives of p@@ id@@ ro@@ mut@@ il@@ ine , a substance that is isolated from fer@@ mentation from C@@ lit@@ op@@ il@@ us pas@@ se@@ ck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pas@@ se@@ ck@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the mode of action of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on the sel@@ ective inhibit@@ ing of the bacterial protein synthesis due to a specific binding point of the 50s sub@@ unit of the bacterial Ri@@ bos@@ om , which differs from the ties of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al internal substances .
data indicate that the bonds of ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al protein L@@ 3 is involved in the region of ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ binding and the Pep@@ tide transfer centre .
by binding to this binding point p@@ am@@ ro@@ mut@@ il@@ ine the pep@@ tide transfer , partially P @-@ binding inter@@ actions and prevent the normal education of active 50s ri@@ bos@@ om sub@@ units .
if the local pre@@ val@@ ence of resistance to the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at least some inf@@ ectious forms appear to be justified by experts .
there were no differences in the in @-@ vitro activity of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin towards S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ate were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in the case of non @-@ respon@@ sive to the treatment of S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tribes was to be considered with additional viral factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) .
absorption In a study with healthy adult , 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be was applied daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion and reduced skin for up to 7 days .
of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ ine twice daily for 5 days to the top@@ ical treatment of secondary infected wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained .
the sampling was performed on the days 3 or 4 in adult patients , before medi@@ ation and the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual systematic intake in humans after top@@ ical application of 1 % sal@@ ine has been reduced to 200 c@@ m2 ( C@@ max = 22 n@@ g / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 n@@ g · h / ml ) 660 times lower than the ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for the PGP in@@ hibition .
Met@@ abol@@ ism The Met@@ abol@@ ism in vitro oxid@@ ative metabolism of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ es was primarily taught by CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 8 and CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) .
in studies for oral tox@@ icity in rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were conducted over 14 days , there were signs of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ ro@@ id changes .
in @-@ vitro examination on gene mut@@ ation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse @-@ lymph@@ oma test or in cultures of human peri@@ ph@@ ic blood lympho@@ cytes and in rats @-@ micro@@ kern@@ els for in @-@ vivo study chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
there was neither male nor female rats at oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , whereby a maximum of 5 times higher exposure was achieved as the most appreciated exposure of humans ( top@@ ical application on 200 c@@ m2 ) .
in an embr@@ y@@ ot@@ ox@@ et@@ ric study of rats at oral dos@@ ages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( corresponding to the ≥ 3 times of the estimated human exposure ( see above ) ) , development factor ( reduced body weight of the fet@@ us and ret@@ inal tox@@ icity ) .

Ambi@@ rix is used to protect hepat@@ itis A and Hepatitis B ( diseases , which affects the liver ) in children aged between one and 15 years , which are not immune to these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix is applied in the scope of a two @-@ doses existing vaccine , whereby a protection against hepat@@ itis B may only be reached after administration of the second dose .
this is why Ambi@@ rix can only be used if there is a low risk of hepat@@ itis B infection during immun@@ isation and ensures that it is possible to end up existing vacc@@ ination with two doses .
if an isch@@ emia is desired for hepat@@ itis A or B , Ambi@@ rix can be given or another Hepatitis B or B vaccine .
vacc@@ ines contribute to the immune system ( the natural defense of the body ) , &quot; as it can fight against a disease .
after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; alien &quot; and produces anti@@ bodies against it .
Ambi@@ rix contains the same components such as the vaccine vacc@@ rix adults and the vaccine vacc@@ rix kids since 1997 .
the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect the same diseases , but Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are administered over three doses of existing vacc@@ um .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix supports identical ingredients , some of the data , which support the application of Twin@@ rix Ad@@ ult , is also used as proof for the application of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indi@@ k@@ ator for the efficacy was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a month after the last injection a protective antibody concentration .
in an additional study with 208 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month distance between the two injec@@ tions .
Ambi@@ rix resulted in between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children a month after the last injection for the development of protecting anti @-@ hepat@@ itis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of the prot@@ rix was similar to a six @-@ month distance between the injec@@ tions .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed at more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses ) are head@@ ache , appet@@ ite deficiency , pain at the injection , redness , mat@@ ch@@ ness ( fatigue ) and irrit@@ ability .
Ambi@@ rix must not be used in patients who react sensiti@@ vely ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other components or Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiot@@ ic ) .
in August 2002 , the European Commission informed the company G@@ lax@@ o@@ Smith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ olog@@ icals s.@@ a. for author@@ ization for the transport of Ambi@@ rix in the entire
the standardi@@ zation board with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ ines , whereby the first dose is administered at the time of choice and the second dose between six and twelve months after the first dose is administered .
if a collection is desired for hepat@@ itis A and hepat@@ itis B , vacc@@ ines can be vacc@@ inated with appropriate vacc@@ ines or combined vacc@@ ination .
the anti @-@ hepat@@ itis B virus ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) antibody and anti @-@ hepat@@ itis B virus ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) antibody and anti @-@ hepat@@ itis B virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) antibody values are in the same size as after vacc@@ ination with the relevant mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ants vacc@@ ines .
it is not fully assured whether immune competent individuals who have addressed to a hepat@@ itis @-@ A@@ - vacc@@ ination , since they may be protected as protection in no longer det@@ ectable anti@@ bodies may be protected by immune memory .
3 As for all injec@@ tion@@ ate substances , for the rare cases of an@@ aphy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the gift of the vaccine , appropriate options of medical treatment and supervision may always be available immediately .
if a fast protection against hepat@@ itis B is required , the standardi@@ zation was recommended with combination of combine hepat@@ itis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepat@@ itis B surface an@@ tigen .
in case of hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the immune system , there is no sufficient anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs antibody values , so the gift of other vacc@@ ines may be required in these cases .
as an intra@@ der@@ mal injection or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration could lead to an optimum imp@@ air@@ ment , these injec@@ tions should be avoided .
in these cases , Ambi@@ rix can be inj@@ ected , however , to inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous amounts due to in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection of bleeding in these cases .
if Ambi@@ rix was given in the second year of a separate injection , simultaneously with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ ie@@ - , tet@@ an@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enza type b vaccine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with a combined m@@ um@@ - m@@ um@@ ps @-@ vaccine vaccine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient ( see section 5.1 ) .
in patients under immun@@ os@@ ur@@ sive therapy or in patients with immun@@ o@@ deficiency , there must be no adequate immune response .
in a clinical study conducted with 3 vacc@@ ination of these form@@ ulation in adults , the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ itis , head@@ aches and fever comparable to the incidence that was observed in former Thi@@ omer@@ ic and preserv@@ ative vacc@@ ination form@@ ulation .
in clinical studies , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ ines were administered to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to and including 15 years .
in a study involving 300 participants in the age of 12 up to and including 15 years , the in@@ compatibility of Ambi@@ rix was compared with the 3 @-@ doses combination vaccine .
only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and mat@@ ur@@ ities on a calculation basis per vacc@@ ination Ambi@@ rix , but not on a calculation basis per person .
pain was observed after the gift of Ambi@@ rix in 5@@ 0.7 % of subjects , compared to 3@@ 9.1 % in the subjects following the gift of a dose of 3 doses to combination .
after the complete vacc@@ ination cycle , 6@@ 6.4 % of the subjects who had given Ambi@@ rix were given , over pain , versus 6@@ 3.8 % were vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combinations .
however , the frequency of Mat@@ u@@ ity was comparable to pro @-@ band ( i.e. about the entire vacc@@ ination cycle at 3@@ 9,6 % of subjects that were given Ambi@@ rix , compared to 3@@ 6.2 % during the subjects that received 3 doses of combination .
the incidence of im@@ pregn@@ ated pain and mat@@ z@@ iness was minor and comparable to which the combination of the combination of combination with the 3 @-@ doses vaccine was observed .
in a compar@@ ative study of 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ old vacc@@ inations , the presence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ group was comparable to that with the 3 @-@ doses combination in@@ active hepat@@ itis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepat@@ itis B surface an@@ tigen was observed .
the 6- until 11@@ - year @-@ old , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix a common occurrence of pain ( at the injection site ) per dose , not per pro@@ band , was reported .
the proportion of vacc@@ ines , which reported about severe side effects during the 2 @-@ doses vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ doses of hepat@@ itis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepat@@ itis B virus and 10 µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant hepat@@ itis B virus infection was statist@@ ically not different .
in clinical trials that were carried out in vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to and including 15 years , the fusion rati@@ os for anti @-@ H@@ AV 9@@ 9.1 % were a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , a month 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
the fusion rates for anti @-@ h@@ bs were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a compar@@ ative study that was carried out at 12@@ - to including 15 year olds , 142 two doses Ambi@@ rix and 147 were given the standard combin@@ ant with three doses .
the 289 Persons whose immun@@ ogen@@ icity was ext@@ end@@ able ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher compared to hepat@@ itis B in the month 2 and 6 according to the gift of the 3 @-@ dose @-@ vacc@@ ines higher than with Ambi@@ rix .
the immune response , which were achieved in a clinical compar@@ ative study at 1- and 11 @-@ year @-@ olds , reached a month after completion of the full vacc@@ ines ( i.e. in month 7 ) , listed in the following table .
in both studies , vacc@@ ines were either formed with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ doses vacc@@ sch@@ ema with a combination of 360 EL@@ ISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ active hepat@@ itis @-@ A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepat@@ itis B surface an@@ tigen .
in persons , which were aged between 12 and 15 years old , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs anti@@ bodies could be detected at least 24 months after immun@@ ization with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 @-@ month vacc@@ ination .
the immune response in this study was comparable to both anti@@ gens , comparable to vacc@@ ination of 3 doses , consisting of 360 EL@@ ISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepat@@ at@@ it@@ is@@ - A @-@ virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepat@@ itis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study at 12@@ - to including 15 year olds , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs anti@@ bodies could be demonstrated 24 months after immun@@ ization in 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ sch@@ ema comparable to that in 0 @-@ 12 months vacc@@ ination .
if the first dose Ambi@@ rix was given in the second year of life using a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ ie@@ - , tet@@ an@@ us , az@@ ell@@ ular pro@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ omyel@@ it@@ is@@ - and 8 Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enza vacc@@ ines was administered , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient .
a clinical trial , which was carried out with 3 doses of the current form@@ ulation in adults , showed the current form@@ ulation similar to Ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ec@@ tions@@ - and ser@@ ok@@ onic rates as for former form@@ ulation .

the hepat@@ itis @-@ A virus is commonly transferred by virus @-@ containing foods and beverages , but can also be transmitted by other ways such as bathing in water contam@@ inated waters .
you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a bli@@ ster face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( j@@ aun@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may make a stationary treatment necessary .
like all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix can not completely protect the infection with hepat@@ itis @-@ hepat@@ itis or hepat@@ itis B virus , even if the complete vacc@@ ines was completed with 2 doses .
if you / your child are infected with hepat@@ itis @-@ hepat@@ itis or hepat@@ itis B virus ( although you feel / her child may not feel un@@ comfortable or sick at the point of time ) , a vaccine may not prevent a disease .
protection against other infections that harm liver or symptoms which are similar to those of hepat@@ itis @-@ hepat@@ itis or hepat@@ itis B infection can not be convey@@ ed .
• If your child has an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any component of this vaccine , including ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiot@@ ic ) .
an allergic reaction can manifest itself by ju@@ ck@@ ling skin strikes , respir@@ atory or swelling of the face or tongue . • When you have occurred an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hepat@@ itis A or Hepatitis B , if you / your child has a severe infection with fever .
• If you want to have a protection against hepat@@ itis B quickly ( i.e. within 6 months and prior to the usually scheduled administration of the second vacc@@ ination ) .
when a possible risk of infection with hepat@@ itis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child from a vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix .
instead , he / your child will recommend 3 injec@@ tions of a combined hepat@@ itis @-@ B virus and hepat@@ itis B vaccine per vaccine dose ( 360 EL@@ ISA units of a formal in@@ active hepat@@ itis B virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepat@@ itis B surface coating ) .
the second vacc@@ ination of this vaccine with reduced amount of effective components is usually given a month after the first dose and should give you a vacc@@ ination protection before end of the vacc@@ ination series .
sometimes , Ambi@@ rix will suffer from heavy blood cl@@ ots suffering from the skin and not inj@@ ected into the muscle . if you / your child are weak@@ ened in your own body or treatment in your own body , or if you / your child may undergo a hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis .
Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these persons on the vaccine cannot be sufficient , so that a blood test may be necessary to see how strongly the reaction to the vaccine is .
21 Say to your doctor if you are taking / receiving your child further medicines ( including those who have been vacc@@ inated without prescri@@ ption ) or if you have received / or immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins ( anti@@ bodies ) has been given / or it is planned in the near future .
however , it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is not protected against either one or both hepat@@ itis A and B virus .
if another vaccine is given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , separate places should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as many as possible .
if Ambi@@ rix is to be given at the same time or after an injection of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine is still sufficient .
usually , Ambi@@ rix will not be given to pregnant or l@@ act@@ ating women unless it is urgent that they are vacc@@ inated against hepat@@ itis A and Hepatitis B .
important information on certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you have shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiot@@ ic ) .
if you miss the agreed appointment for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and make a new date as soon as possible .

Ambi@@ rix is available in packages to 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and packs to 50 without need@@ les available .
based on the data , which has become known since the issu@@ ance of the first approval for the traffic authority , CH@@ MP re@@ signed the benefit of the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix .
however , since Ambi@@ rix was only in one member state ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available security data for this medicine is limited to the low patient value .
ammon@@ ium can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with in@@ complete En@@ z@@ ym@@ atic or hyper@@ ammon@@ ium en@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy ( brain damage due to high ammon@@ i@@ ac@@ concentrations ) in pre@@ history .
ammon@@ ium - divided into several individual components with meals - swallowed by the food mixed or via a gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ chi@@ ves ( through the stomach @-@ ceiling in the stomach of leading hose ) or a nose son@@ ic ( by the nose into the stomach of leading hose ) .
it was not a compar@@ ative study , since ammon@@ ium does not have to be compared to other treatment or placebo ( a placebo , i.e. without active ingredient ) .
ammon@@ ium can also cause loss of appet@@ ite , loss of acid in blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , head@@ ache , o@@ ops , vom@@ iting , nau@@ sea , c@@ logging , nau@@ sea , failure , skin r@@ ash or weight gain .
at the end , the Committee on Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that ammon@@ ium is effectively prevented in patients with the urea cycle of high ammon@@ i@@ ac disease .
ammon@@ ium was approved under &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; because of the condition of the disease at the time of admission only limited information on this medicine .
the use is indicated in all patients with which a complete en@@ c@@ ym@@ atic organ has already manifest@@ ed in the new@@ bor@@ age ( within the first 28 life days ) .
in patients with a late @-@ manifest@@ ed form ( in@@ full en@@ c@@ ym@@ defective , which is manifest@@ ed after the first month of life ) , an indication for the use when in An@@ am@@ n@@ ese is a hyper@@ ammon@@ ite en@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy .
for babies , for children who are not able to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form .
the daily dose is individually calculated using the protein toler@@ ance and the necessary daily protein intake of the patient .
according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as for growing and adults .
in patients who suffer an early manifest@@ ed lack of car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate synthetic or or@@ ni@@ in@@ tran@@ scar@@ bam@@ boo , the subst@@ itution of cit@@ rul@@ ine or arg@@ in@@ ine is required at a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
patients with an Arg@@ in@@ in@@ os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ oplast@@ y deficiency have to get arg@@ in@@ ine in a dosage of 0,4 @-@ 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be given to patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , as there is a risk for the emergence of est@@ s@@ oph@@ ag@@ ul@@ zer@@ a if the tablets cannot enter into the stomach .
each tablet of the AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be used for patients with con@@ gest@@ i@@ ver heart failure or severe kidney failure and with sodium re@@ tention and eye @-@ raising clinical conditions only with caution .
since Met@@ abol@@ ism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of So@@ vi@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat takes place over the liver and the kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should be used in patients with liver or kidney failure only with extreme caution .
the importance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in sub@@ cut@@ aneous gift of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etat in young rats in high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal refin@@ ement and a increased loss of neur@@ ons .
a delay of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a dimin@@ ished number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
it could not be found if phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etat is ex@@ cre@@ ted to humans in breast milk and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during lac@@ tation is contra@@ indicated during a halt ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , 56 % of patients found at least an undes@@ ired event ( AE ) and 78 % of these undes@@ ired events were assumed that they were not connected with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old an@@ ore@@ tic en@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy in combination with Lak@@ e@@ ac@@ ia , severe Hy@@ po@@ kal@@ emia , P@@ anz@@ y@@ t@@ open@@ ia , peri@@ ph@@ erer neu@@ rop@@ athy and pan@@ cre@@ atitis .
the case of an over@@ dose occurred at a 5 @-@ month old inf@@ ant with an acci@@ dental single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms come with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etat , which showed a dos@@ cope @-@ limit@@ ing neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity at an intraven@@ ous administration of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etat is an met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed active compound containing glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ylene glut@@ amine , which is ex@@ cre@@ ted through the kidneys .
pest@@ il@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally is seen in phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine therefore is therefore as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the urea cycle can be assumed that for each gram , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ stock can be produced between 0,@@ 12 and 0.15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ylene glut@@ amine .
it is of importance that the diagnosis is early and the treatment is immediately begun to improve survival and clinical results .
the progn@@ osis of the early manifest form of the disease with the appearance of the first symptoms in the new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always inf@@ ectious - and the disease himself led to death with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids , or with their nitrogen @-@ free analogue in the first year of life .
due to hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis , the use of alternative ways of nitrogen waste ( sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and possibly subst@@ itution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ bor@@ ns at post@@ part@@ al ( however within the first month of life ) to increase diagnosed diseases to 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed during pregnancy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients the survival rate was with many intellectual disabilities or other neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its .
in patients with a late form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ ous form of the Or@@ ni@@ in@@ tran@@ scar@@ zo@@ y@@ las@@ e @-@ deficiency ) , which were treated from hyper@@ ammon@@ ium en@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy and subsequently treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and a prot@@ ein@@ ed diet , the survival rate was 98 % .
existing Neu@@ rolog@@ ical defic@@ its are hardly reversible and in some patients , a further deteri@@ oration of the neurolog@@ ical condition can occur .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etat , which is con@@ ju@@ gated in liver and kidney , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine were determined according to the gift of a single dose of 5 g sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ stock in patients with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the urea cycle , hem@@ og@@ glob@@ osis , and with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis as well as repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( not controlled trials ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metabol@@ ites were also investigated for intraven@@ ous gift of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etat .
after an oral individual dose of 5 g of sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ stock in tablets were found 15 minutes after taking the plasma concentration of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat .
in the majority of patients with urea cycle disorders or hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ opathy was no phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etat in the following morning after no@@ c@@ tur@@ nal fast@@ ings , no phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etat in the plasma was shown .
in three of six patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis , which were repeatedly covered with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 20 g / day oral in three individual doses ) , the mean phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations found in the third day five times higher than after the first gifts .
ex@@ cre@@ tion The medication is ex@@ cre@@ ted by the kidneys within 24 hours of about 80 to 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ g@@ ated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
according to the results of Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us testing , So@@ vi@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat had been treated with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses ( examination 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 2800 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules is taken either or@@ ally ( babies and children who can swal@@ low not any tablets or patients with swal@@ lowing disorders ) or a gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ fier or a nas@@ al son@@ ic .
according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as for growing and adults .
the concentration of ammonia , arg@@ in@@ ine , essential amino acids ( in particular bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um proteins should be kept within the normal range .
in patients who suffer an early manifest@@ ed lack of car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate synthetic or or@@ ni@@ in@@ tran@@ scar@@ bam@@ boo , the subst@@ itution of cit@@ rul@@ ine or arg@@ in@@ ine is required at a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5,4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , equivalent to the maximum daily dose .
when the atten@@ de@@ es were exposed to the birth of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etat ( an active met@@ abo@@ ite of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) , it came to les@@ ions in the pyramid of the brain .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old an@@ ore@@ tic en@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy in combination with Lak@@ e@@ ac@@ ia , severe Hy@@ po@@ kal@@ emia , P@@ anz@@ y@@ t@@ open@@ ia , peri@@ ph@@ erer neu@@ rop@@ athy and pan@@ cre@@ atitis .
pest@@ il@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally is seen in phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine therefore is therefore as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess goods .
on the basis of investigations on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the urea cycle , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ stock can be produced between 0,@@ 12 and 0.15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ylene glut@@ amine .
existing Neu@@ rolog@@ ical defic@@ its are hardly reversible , and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of the neurolog@@ ical condition can occur .
after an oral individual dose of 5 g of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form , 15 minutes after intake of the plasma concentration of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat were noted .
during the duration of durability , the patient can use the finished product for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not over 25 ° C .
in this case the small measuring sco@@ op 0.@@ 95 g , the average measuring sco@@ op of 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat .
if a patient has to obtain the medicine over a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ ub@@ ility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing , so that they accum@@ ulate the nitrogen of waste in the body after consumption of protein in the body .
if lab tests are performed , you must tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , since sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat can influence the results of certain laboratory studies .
when taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or recently taken if it is not prescri@@ ption medicine .
during lac@@ tation , you may not take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS because it could damage the medicine in breast milk and harm to your baby .
in rare cases , con@@ fu@@ sions , head@@ aches , taste problems , desserts , dis@@ orientation , memory disorders , and deteri@@ oration of existing neurolog@@ ical conditions were observed .
if you encounter one of these symptoms , please contact your doctor or your doctor &apos;s emergency doctor for an introduction of an appropriate treatment .
if you forget the intake of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal .
changes in hem@@ or@@ rh@@ age ( red blood cells , thro@@ es ) , loss of appet@@ ite , depression , irrit@@ ability , head@@ ache , nau@@ sea , nau@@ sea , nau@@ sea , nau@@ sea , nau@@ sea , kidney disease , weight gain and an@@ om@@ al laboratory values .

An@@ gi@@ ox will be used to treat patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ sis &quot; ( ACS , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for example at inst@@ abil@@ er Ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; ST@@ RU@@ TH@@ ING &quot; ( an an@@ om@@ ination value at electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) .
if An@@ gi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients who will undergo a PCI , a higher dose may be administered and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this can help patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS , with the effect of angi@@ ox in sole gift or in connection with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ IA inhibit@@ or ( GP@@ I , another medicine to prevent blood cl@@ ots ) with a conventional combination treatment with Hep@@ arin ( another antibody drug ) and a GP@@ I .
during the PCI the patient was often a st@@ ent ( a short tube that remains in the ar@@ tery to prevent a lock ) , and they also received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots , such as Ab@@ ci@@ xim@@ ab and A@@ spir@@ in .
in the treatment of ACS was An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without a gift of GP@@ I - in preventing new events ( deaths , heart attacks or prec@@ as@@ cul@@ ari@@ zation ) after 30 days or a year as effective as normal treatment .
in patients who underwent a PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox was just as effective as Hep@@ arin , except for heavy bleeding in which it was significantly more effective than Hep@@ arin .
An@@ gi@@ ox may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine , other de@@ ud@@ ine or other components .
it may not be applied to patients who recently had a bleeding , as well as people with strong high blood pressure or serious kidney problems or a heart infection .
the Committee on Human@@ inary Medicine ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that An@@ gi@@ ox is a acceptable replacement for Hep@@ arin during a PCI , while a PCI is an acceptable replacement for Hep@@ arin .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the Company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd with permission to transport An@@ gi@@ ox throughout the European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ mes ( inst@@ ab@@ ile ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST ) in@@ far@@ ction ( IA / N@@ ST@@ EM@@ I ) or an early intervention is planned .
the recommended initial dose of angi@@ ox in patients with ACS is an intraven@@ ous bolt of 0.1 mg / kg , followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
if a PCI is carried out in another sequence , an additional Bol@@ us of 0.5 mg / kg should be increased and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention should be increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
according to the PCI , after clinical requirements , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0,@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be resumed for 4 to 12 hours .
immediately before the procedure , a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be administered , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the pressure .
the recommended dosage of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI is made up of an initial intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 0,@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the intervention .
safety and effectiveness of a single Bol@@ us gift by An@@ gi@@ ox has not been examined and is not recommended if a short PCI procedure is planned .
if this value is shortened to under 225 seconds , this value should be shortened by 0.3 mg / kg / body@@ weight ( ACT after 5 minutes ) .
to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values , the re@@ constit@@ uted and diluted medicine should be carefully mixed and administered intraven@@ ously before applying to the application .
once the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , another monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg In@@ fusion dose is administered correctly .
in patients with moderate @-@ severe kidney function ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which is subjected to a PCI ( whether with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine is treated against ACS or not ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used .
if the ACT @-@ value is less than 225 seconds , a second type of bolt of 0.3 mg / kg is enough to check the ACT 5 minutes once again after the second bolt .
in patients with moderate kidney damage , which was included in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( Re@@ place @-@ 2 ) , which was included , the ACT value was 5 minutes after the gift of the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in Bol@@ us without dos@@ is@@ sist@@ ency on average ( 366 ± 89 seconds ) .
3 For patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also with di@@ aly@@ sis patients An@@ gi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
the treatment with An@@ gi@@ ox can be initiated within 30 minutes after the termination of the intraven@@ ous Hep@@ arin or 8 hours after the termination of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous gift of low @-@ molecular Hep@@ arin .
• known hyper@@ sensitivity to the active substance or other components or against her@@ ud@@ ine • active bleeding and / or ir@@ reversible hyper@@ ton@@ ia . • severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially when bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see section 4.5 ) .
even if PCI @-@ patient occur under bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine most ble@@ edings on arter@@ ial pun@@ cture , patients can undergo a per@@ cut@@ aneous Kor@@ on@@ ar@@ intervention ( PCI ) , while the treatment is generally occurring in hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages .
in patients receiving war@@ far@@ in and treated with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine , a monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International norm@@ alised debt recovery ) should be considered to ensure that the level of treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine was once again achieved before the treatment .
starting from the knowledge about the mechanisms of action of anti@@ o@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( Hep@@ arin , war@@ far@@ in , thro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tics or plat@@ el@@ bo@@ zy@@ ten@@ dencies ) can assume that these compounds increase blood risk .
in any case , the clinical and biological hem@@ og@@ ging parameters are to be controlled regularly in any case with the combination of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
the experimental studies are in@@ sufficient regarding the pregnancy , the embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , which in@@ adequ@@ ately in@@ adequ@@ ately in@@ sufficient ( see section 5.3 ) .

both light and heavy bleeding occurred in significantly less common than in the compar@@ ative group of Hep@@ arin plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ IA inhibit@@ or .
the following side effects , which are not listed above , were reported according to comprehensive application in practice and are classified according to system organs in table 6 .
in case of an over@@ dose the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine is immediately broken down and the patient nar@@ ro@@ ig with regard to signs of bleeding .
An@@ gi@@ ox contains Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine , a direct and specific Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in@@ war@@ or , which binds both in the cataly@@ tic centre as well as on the A@@ ni@@ mb@@ in region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , regardless of whether the Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is bound in the liquid phase or on Ger@@ inn@@ sel .
the binding of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in on Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and thus its effect , is reversible , because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in considers the binding of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in @-@ Arg@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , making the function of the active centre of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in re@@ generates .
in addition , Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine was inter@@ fer@@ ed with ser@@ um of patients with which it came to he@@ par@@ in@@ induced thro@@ cy@@ t@@ open@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced thro@@ mb@@ osis syndrome ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) , in@@ duce no thro@@ cy@@ te ag@@ gregate reaction .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children from six years with diabetes who need treatment with insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) in the abdominal wall , inj@@ ected the th@@ igh or the upper arm with an insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regul@@ ate the glucose level ( sugar ) or insulin .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in differs mar@@ ke@@ dly from human@@ ities , and the change means that it works faster and shorter than a short term human beings .
A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in combination with a long @-@ effective insulin in combination with type 1 diabetes , in which the body cannot produce insulin , in two studies with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
for type 2 diabetes , insulin is not effective in which the body can not work effectively , A@@ pi@@ dra was examined in a study with 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indi@@ k@@ ator for the effectiveness was the change of concentration of the substance gly@@ co@@ iled hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
in the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.0@@ 14 % ( from 7,@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) compared to a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % at insulin @-@ l@@ is@@ per was noted after six months .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , the decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % with human normal levels .
A@@ pi@@ dra can not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against insulin or one of the other components , or in patients who are already suffering from hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ ca@@ emia .
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra might need to be adjusted , if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood glucose level .
in September 2004 the European Commission adopted the company San@@ of@@ i @-@ A@@ vent@@ is Deutschland GmbH , author@@ ization for the transport of A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra is used as a sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the field of abdominal wall , th@@ igh or to sub@@ cut@@ aneous injec@@ tor by continuous in@@ fusion in the field of abdominal cav@@ ity .
due to the reduced glucose consumption and reduced insulin delivery , the insulin needs in patients with a limitation of liver function may be reduced .
any change of action strength , the brand ( Her@@ - St@@ eller ) , insulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc delayed , etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the manufacturing method can draw a change of insulin .
3 An in@@ adequate dosage or termination of treatment , especially in patients with an ins@@ ul@@ able diabetes , may lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and di@@ abe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ azi@@ z ; these conditions are potentially endangered .
conversion of a patient to another insulin type or an insulin treatment should be conducted under strict medical supervision and can make a change of dosage necessary .
the timing of a hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the action profile of the used insulin and can therefore change at the change@@ over of the treatment schem@@ as .
to the substances that increase blood sugar levels and intensi@@ fy the inc@@ lin@@ ation to hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ n@@ ics , an@@ gi@@ ot@@ en@@ in @-@ converting enzyme ( ACE ) -@@ Hem@@ mer , pent@@ ox@@ if@@ yl@@ line , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ics , ly@@ ph@@ yl@@ ates , c@@ aliz@@ yl@@ ates and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiot@@ ics .
in addition , under the effect of sympath@@ oly@@ tics such as Bet@@ ab@@ lock@@ ers , C@@ lon@@ id@@ in , Gu@@ an@@ eth@@ id@@ in and spare pin the symptoms of rep@@ in@@ ac@@ ea contra@@ diction are weak@@ ened or missing .
experimental studies on reproduction of reproduction showed no difference between in@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human@@ ities regarding pregnancy , the embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , the birth or the post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .

after a glucose injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the urine cause for severe hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ c@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes .
insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimul@@ ating the peripher@@ al glucose intake ( especially through skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature and fat ) and the in@@ hibition of glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in sub@@ cut@@ aneous Ga@@ - be eff@@ ected by insulin treatment and the active duration is shorter than at hu@@ - man@@ em normal levels .
in a study involving 18 male individuals aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes , insulin @-@ relevant disp@@ ensing area from 0.0@@ 75 to 0.15 E / kg showed a proportional increase of the glu@@ ing effect , and with 0.3 E / kg or more a proportional increase of the glu@@ ing effect , precisely like human@@ ities .
insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has a double so fast active ingredient like normal human@@ ities and achieves the full visu@@ aliz@@ es@@ cent effect around 2 hours earlier than human@@ ities .
from the data was evident that during an application of insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before meal , a comparable post@@ p@@ ran@@ al gly@@ cem@@ ic control is reached , as with human normal levels , which will be given 30 minutes before the meal .
when insulin was harvest@@ ed 2 minutes before the meal , a better post@@ p@@ ran@@ al control was given as with human normal levels , which was given 2 minutes before the meal .
if insulin is turned into 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal , a similar gly@@ cem@@ ic control is given as with human normal levels , which is given 2 Mi@@ - N@@ es before the meal ( see Figure 1 ) .
insulin treatment in gift 2 minutes before the beginning of the meal was given in comparison to human normal levels , 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min ) before the beginning of the meal was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( Figure 1@@ B ) .
