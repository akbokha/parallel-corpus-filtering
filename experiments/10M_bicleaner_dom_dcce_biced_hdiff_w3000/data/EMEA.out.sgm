<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public Bedication Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee on Humanities (CHMP) has assessed the studies carried out in order to obtain recommendations regarding the application of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you require further information about your disease or treatment, please read the packagage (also part of the EPAR) or apply to your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">If you wish further information regarding the recommendations of CHMP, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, than 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of hot tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), as a solution to intake (1 mg / ml) and as a injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. wirres thinking and speaking, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not present), distrust and delusions; • Bipolar-I disorder, a mental disorder in which patients have manic episodes (periods of abnormal high spirits) alternately with periods of normal tuning.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used for the treatment of severe and severe therapeutic episodes and prevention of manic episodes in patients who have been addressed to the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for fast control of stressed unrest or behavioral problems if the oral ingestion of drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both diseases, the solution can be used to insert or use melting tablets in patients, which prepares the swallowing of tablets.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who simultaneously use other medicines, the same as Abilify should be removed, the dose of Abilify should be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="10">This affects the signal transmission between brain cells by "neurotransmitter," i.e. chemical substances which enable communication of nerve cells to another.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazol is believed to appear especially as "partial Agist" for the receptors for the neurotransmitter Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripiprazol as 5-hydroxytryptamin, and dopamine, but in lower dimensions as the neurotransmitter seems to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, helps normalize the activity of the brain, preventing psychotic or manic symptoms, and their restart is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="14">The efficacy of Abilify to prevent rebirth of symptoms, was investigated in three studies via up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of the injection solution was evaluated in two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases, compared to a placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abilify was opposed to 347 patients with Haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo which had been stabilized on 160 patients, in which the manic symptoms were stabilized with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of Abilify injection solution was evaluated in a study of 301 patients with bipolar disorder, which had an unceasing disturbance, compared to Lorazepam (another antipsychotic medicine) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies, the alteration of the symptoms of patients based on a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients suffering on treatment were examined.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted trials to investigate how the body absorbs melting tablets and the solution to absorb (decreasing).</seg>
<seg id="20">In both studies with the injection solution patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg received a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms resulting in a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In use for the treatment of bipolar disorder Abilify, Abilify in four of the five short-term studies lack as placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">In addition to 74 weeks, Abilify prevented the reoccurrence of Manic episodes in previously treated patients and if additional treatment was administered to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15 mg doses also decreased more effective than placebo perceived their symptoms and were similar to Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects of Abilify to insert (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients), vomiting, nausea (nausea), vomiting, nausea (nausea), vomiting, nausea (nausea), vomiting, nausea (nausea), redness and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnie (sleep disorders) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The conclusion that the benefits of Abschizophrenia (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and from moderate to serious incidents in patients who were mainly manic episodes on treatment with Aripiprazole, compared to the risks involved.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the Committee came to the result that the benefits of injection solution during quick control of stressed unrest and behavioral problems in patients with mitschizophrenia or patients with manic episodes are not suitable, compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004 the European Commission adopted the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. a permit for the transport of Abilify in the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">ABILIFY is for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of the bipolar disorder and for prevention of a new manic episode in patients showing the mainly manic episodes and their manic episodes on the treatment with Aripiprazol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg / day with a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">Increased effectiveness in doses above a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg once daily, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">With regard to the larger sensitivity of this patient group, a lower initial dose should be considered, if clinical factors have to justify this (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">When the CYP3A4 inductor is removed from combination therapy, the arithpiprazol should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suiciary behaviour belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after changing an antipsychotic therapy (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that patients with bipolar disorder mean no increased risk of risk with Aripiprazol compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazol should be treated with caution in patients with well-known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial insufficiency, overpowering disorders), cerebrovascular disease, conditions that can be applied for hypotony and hypertension (including acute and maligne form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 Spätdyskinesias: in clinical trials that observed one year or less, there were occasional reports on the treatment with Aripiprazol occurring Dynasty.</seg>
<seg id="39">When patients treated with ABILIFY patients and symptoms of late dydyskinesia should be taken, should reduce the dose or break the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient develops signs and symptoms resulting in a mns, or unclear high fever without any additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotics, including ABILIFY, must be set.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore Aripiprazol should be used in patients with seizures in the Anamnese or at the conditions related to seizures, with caution.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years old with Aripiprazol in patients with psychosis related to Alzheimer's disease had patients who were treated with Aripiprazol, an increased risk of death compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, there was one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between the dosage and the response to unwanted cerebrovascular events with Aripiprazol treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with Ketoaziz or hyperosmolarem coma or death, was reported in patients who were treated with atypical antipsychotic compounds including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="45">There is no precise risk assessment regarding hyperglycemia-related events associated with ABILIFY and other atypical antipsychotic compounds to patients who allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsy, polymers, polyphagia and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus, or risk factors for diabetes mellitus should regularly be monitored in terms of deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">A weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar mania due to comorbidities, which is known for weight gain than side effects, and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effects of Aripiprazol on the central nervous system, caution is advisable if Aripiprazol is used in combination with alcohol or other centralized medicines such as sedation (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2-antagonist Famotidin, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the resorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is not considered clinically irrelevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy volunteers a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidin) increased the AUC of Aripiprazol by 107% while the Cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected to have other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, similar effects and therefore should have similar dosing reductions.</seg>
<seg id="52">The joint application of CYP2D6 'bad' (= "Poor") can result in joint application with high-effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 from Aripiprazol compared to CYP2D6 extensiveness Metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="53">If one considers the joint gift of Ketoconazole or other high-effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY, the potential benefits should exceed the potential risks for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV proteinase inhibitors, may have similar effects and therefore should have similar dosing reductions.</seg>
<seg id="55">After placing the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitors, the dose of ABILIFY should be increased to the dosing height before the beginning of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Dileazem or Escitalopram (or CYP2D6) together with ABILIFY can be administered together with a moderate increase in the Aripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical studies, doses of 10-30 mg Aripiprazol had no significant impact on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan / 3-methodxycycine-Ratio), 2C9 (Omeprazol) and 3A4 (dextromethorphan).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to inform their doctor if they are pregnant or planning a pregnancy during treatment with Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="59">Due to the insufficient data situation for the human being and due to the concerns regarding the human rights, this drug may not be applied in the pregnancy, unless the potential benefits justifies the potential risk for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, in other antipsychotics, patients should be warned of using dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, including motor vehicles, until they are certain that Aripiprazole does not have any negative influence.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medical-related side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria: frequently (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - in a controlled long-term study over 52 weeks joined patients who were treated with Aripiprazol, a total of lower incidence (25,8%), including Parkinsonism, Akathisie, Dystony and Dycorinesia, compared with patients who were treated with Haloperidol (57,3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, incidence of EPS 19% was included in patients under Aripiprazol treatment and 13,1% in patients under Placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14.8% was treated with Aripiprazol, 15.1% in patients under Olanzapper therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Therapeutic episodes in bipolar-I disorder - In a controlled study above 12 weeks the incidence of EPS amounted to 23,5% in patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 53,3% in patients under Haloperidol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study above 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26,6% showed in patients under Aripiprazol treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium-treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">During the long-time period, over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled trial was the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 15.7% for placebo treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between patient groups under Aripiprazol and placebo in which potentially clinically controlled laboratory parameters were found, yielded no medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Increases the Cpk (creatine-phosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazol, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">To the side effects, which may occur in connection with an antipsychotic therapy, the maligne neuroleptosis, spätdyskinesis and increased mortality in elderly dementia cases, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the market launch, unintentionally or deliberate overdose with Aripiprazol has been observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death sequence.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although no information about the efficacy of a hematalysis in treating an overdose with Aripiprazol, it is unlikely that hematalysis in the treatment of an overdose of use is, da Aripiprazole has a high plasma binding.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is assumed that the effectiveness of Aripiprazol in schizophrenia and bipolar-I disorder on the combination of a partial agonistic effect on dopamine and serotonin 5HT1- receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors will be conveyed.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripiprazol showed a high affinity for dopamine and D3-receptor and serotonin 5HT1a- and 5HT2a receptor as well as a moderate affinity for dopamine D4-, for serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, for alpha-1-repinepy and to the histamine-H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">In the gift of Aripiprazol in dosages of 0.5 to 30 mg once a day over 2 weeks of healthy subjects showed the positive-dependent reduction of the combination of 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligands, at the Nucleus caudatus and on the coup.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled trial studies (4 to 6 weeks) in 1.228 schizophrenic patients showed a statistically significant improvement of psychotic symptoms in comparison to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a week 52 of the study conducted in a Haloperidol study enrolled in both groups (Aripiprazol 77% and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values of measuring scales, which were defined as secondary studies, including PANSS and Montgomery - depression rate, showed significantly stronger improvement than at Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study, more than 26 weeks in stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia was significantly higher reduction in recurrence, which was 34% in the Aria prazol group and 57% below placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an Olanzapin-controlled, multinational double-blind study included in schizophrenia (N = 18 or 13% of the analysis value) in significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the output value (i.e. an increase of at least 5,6 kg) with an average weight of approx. 5 kg.</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with a flexible or mixed Episode of Bipolar-I-Disorder, Aripiprazol showed a placebo-superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dose of patients with a manic or mixed Episode of Bipolar-I Disorder, Aripiprazol showed no superior effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placeboarding and active-controlled monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar element, Aripiprazol showed a comparison to placebo superior effectiveness in week 3 and a response effect that was comparable to that of lithium or Haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">In week 12 Aripiprazol also demonstrated a comparable share of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania to like lithium or Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled trial over 6 weeks with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar disorder study, with or without psychotic diseases, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazol revealed a superior effectiveness in reduction Manic symptoms compared to the Monotherapy with lithium or valproate.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled study, over 26 weeks, followed by a long-term expansion phase about 74 weeks before a stabilization phase, Aripiprazole was superior to placebo in regard to prevention of a bipolar return case, predominantly in prevention of a decline in the Mania.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies, the enzymes of CYP6 and CYP2D6 are responsible for the Dehydration and hydroxyation of Aripiprazole, the N-Dealkylation is catalysed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "the mean elimination period of approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazol is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazole through CYP2D6 and for nearly 146 hours at 'bad' (=" Poor ") Metabolisers via CYP2D6." ""</seg>
<seg id="90">In Aripiprazol there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy subjects, as well as a pharmacokinetic study of schizophrenic patients showed no gender-dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A populiar-specific analysis for pharmacokinetics was found no indication of clinically significant differences in the ethics or the effect of smoking at the Pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripiprazol and Dehydro-Aripiprazol were similar in patients with severe kidney failure in comparison to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study involving human liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the impact of the liver function to the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazol, but the study included only 3 patients with liver cirrhosis of the class C, which is not enough to draw conclusions to their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated gift, reproduction, resotoxicity and for canogeneous potential, the pre-clinical data showed no special dangers for human beings.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only during dosages or exposure, which clearly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans, so they have limited liability for clinical application only limited or no meaning.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects of dosing-dependent side effects and / or parenchycin loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (corresponds to 10 to 60 mg / kg / day) in female rats at 60 mg / kg / day (the 10times the medium-to-mean-state-exposure (AUC) during the recommended maximum dose of humans).</seg>
<seg id="97">In addition, in addition to the recommended dose of sulfate conjugums of Hydroxy- Metabolites of Aripiprazol in the bile duct of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (AUC) was found at the recommended clinical dose or the 16 - to 81times of the recommended maximum dose when people is based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg. of the sulphate conjugate of hydroxy- Aripiprazol, however, found no more than 6% of the concentrations found in the study above 39 weeks in the gall of monkeys and are far below the limit values (6%) of in vitro solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits these effects were observed by dosages, which led to Expositions of 3- and 11 times the medium Steady-state AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="386">Anonymity symptoms and symptoms can be different depending on age, sex and total disease load; therefore the evaluation of individual clinical diagnosis and health insurrection is required by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="387">A rise in hemogglobins around more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to the variability between patients, individual hemoglobinings may occasionally be observed on or under the hemoglobin- target concentration.</seg>
<seg id="389">In view of these hemoglobinaries, the hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6,2 mmol / l) to reach 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l) is needed.</seg>

<seg id="599">Aclasta is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure (Kreatinine-Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min), there are only limited clinical experiences.</seg>
<seg id="600">Pre-existing Hypokalzemia is used prior to treatment with Aclasta to treat sufficient supply of calcium and vitamin D (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="601">Due to the rapid implementation of Zoledronc acid on bone structure, a temporary, mittedly symptomatic hypokalemia may develop, whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days following the infusion of Aclasta (see section 4.8).</seg>

<seg id="634">The total mortality was 10% (101 patients) in patients treated with Aclasta compared with 13% (141 patients) in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="635">Effect on bone mineral density (BMD) In the HORIZON RFT study increased the Aclasta treatment in comparison to placebo treatment the BMD on the total surface and scraps of all time points.</seg>
<seg id="636">The Aclasta treatment performed over 24 months compared to placebo treatment for an increase of the BMD by 5.4% on the total rate and 4,3% of the total population.</seg>
<seg id="637">Clinical efficacy in males In the HORIZON RFT study were randomized 508 men and were evaluated at 185 patients the BMD was evaluated after 24 months.</seg>
<seg id="638">The study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical trials in men; the frequency of clinical trials was 7.5% in Aclasta-treated males compared to 8.7% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="639">In another study in males (study CZOL446M2308), an annual administration of Aclasta was referred to as compared to the once weekly change of lumendronat, based on the percentage change of lumbar vortex-BMD after 24 months.</seg>
<seg id="640">Clinical efficacy of treatment at Morbus Paget of the bone of Aclasta was studied in patients and patients at the age over 30 years with radiological confirmsuit (mean serum mirror of alkaline phosphatase correspondingly to 2.6x to 3-fold-specific upper normal value for inclusion in the study).</seg>
<seg id="641">11 The effectiveness of an infusion of 5 mg Zoledronc acid in comparison to the intake of 30 mg risedronat once daily for 2 months was demonstrated in two six months of comparison studies.</seg>
<seg id="642">In the combined results, a similar decrease of pain intensity and pain-influenced comparing for Aclasta and Risedronat was observed after 6 months.</seg>
<seg id="643">Patients who were classified as responding at the end of the six month main study (on the therapy) could be recorded in a follow-up phase.</seg>
<seg id="644">From the 143 with Aclasta and 107 with the risron of patients treated at the follow-up study, the therapeutic response was 141 with Aclasta, compared with 71 who treated with Risedronat treated patients with a median duration of the follow-up period of 18 months after application.</seg>
<seg id="645">Unique and multiple 5 and 15 minutes of infusion of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg of Zoledron acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmacokinetic data that proved to be dosisindependent.</seg>
<seg id="646">After that, the plasma level increased rapidly to &lt; 10% of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1% after 24 h, followed by a long lasting phase, no more than 0.1% of the maximum value.</seg>
<seg id="647">Siberian biphasic vanishing from the great circulation of half times t ½ α 0,24 and t ½ hours 1,87 hours, followed by a long elimination phase with a terminal elimination cycle of ½ h 146 hours.</seg>
<seg id="648">The early distribution phases (α and white, with the aforementioned t ½ -values) will probably represent the rapid resorption in the bone and the excretion about the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">In the first 24 h 39 ± 16% of the administered dose can be found in the urine, while the rest is mainly bound to bone tissue.</seg>
<seg id="650">The total body-Clearance is independent of the dose 5.04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains unaffected by gender, age, race or body weight.</seg>
<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion period from 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of Zoledronacid concentration by 30% at the end of infusion, but had no effect on the surface under the curve (plasma concentration against time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A diminished Clearance of the P450-EnzymSystems metabolized substances is unlikely, because Zoledron's folic acid is not metabolized and because they require a weak or even no direct and / or irreversible, fuel-dependent inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Special patient groups (see section 4.2) The renal Clearance of Zoledron acid correlated with the creatinine-Clearance, namely 75 ± 33% of the creatinine-Clearance, and at the 64 examined patients in average 84 ± 29 ml / min (range 22 to 143 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="654">As a result, a slight (clcr = 50- 80 ml / min) and excessive kidney function up to a creatinine-clearing up to 35 ml / min does not require any dose of dosing of zoledron.</seg>
<seg id="655">For severe kidney problems (Kreatinine Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min) only limited data are available, no statements are possible for this population.</seg>
<seg id="656">Acute toxicity The highest non-leted intravenous single dose was 10 mg / kg body weight in mice and rats 0.6 mg / kg body weight.</seg>
<seg id="657">In studies of dogs, single doses of 1.0 mg / kg (based on AUC) have been administered during a period of 15 minutes, good and without any renal influence.</seg>
<seg id="658">Subchronic and chronic toxicity In studies with intravenous application, the renal tolerability of Zoledron's exposure was obtained in 3-day intervals, a total of 6 times (a cumulative dose that is given at intervals of 2- 3 weeks (a cumulative dose, which corresponds to the 7x of the human therapy exposition to the AUC, corresponds to), well tolerated.</seg>

<seg id="660">The most common results in studies with repeated application was an increased primary spongiosa during the Metaphysification of the long bones with almost all doses, a result that reflects the pharmacological, antiresortive effect of the substance.</seg>
<seg id="661">In rats a teratogenic function was observed from 0.2 mg / kg as an outer and inner (visceral) abnormalities and such a skeleton.</seg>
<seg id="662">In rabbits, no teratogenic effects or embryo-fetal effects were observed, although the maternal toxicity was calculated at 0,1 mg / kg as a result of the seriedrigter serum-calcium mirrors.</seg>

<seg id="749">Summary of the EPAR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Bedication Report (EPAR), in which explains how the Committee for Humanism (CHMP) evaluates the studies carried out in order to obtain recommendations regarding the application of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="750">Acettos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). it can be applied solely on patients (especially overweight patients). • It can be used together with another diabetic medication (al therapy).</seg>
<seg id="751">In addition to metformin in patients (especially important patients) can be applied in particular with metformin alone in the highest tolerable dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulfa drugs or insulin, the previous dose of sulfa drugs may be retained, except for patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); this should be reduced by the dose of sulfa drugs or insulin.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's own insulin can be utilized and blood sugar levels, thus reducing type 2 diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1 400 patients the effectiveness of Acettos in tripletherapy was investigated; in addition, patients received a combination of metformin with sulfa drugs, in addition, they received either Acettos or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycoylized hemoglobin, HbA1c) measured how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="756">Acettos resulted in a lowering of the HbA1c value, which suggests that blood sugar levels were reduced by 15 mg, 30 mg, and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the Tripletherapy study the effect of additional treatment with metformin and a sulfa drugs result in a lowering of the HbA1c values increased by 0.94% while the additional gift of placebo increased to a reduction of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study, in which the combination of Acettos and insulin was studied in 289 patients, the patients who Acettos increased from 0.69% to 6 months, compared with 0.14% in patients who took a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common adverse events related to Acettos were visual disturbances, infections of the upper respiratory symptoms (colds), weight gain and hyalesthesia (reduced sensitivity to irritation).</seg>
<seg id="760">Acettos may not be used for patients who may react sensitively (allergic) to pioglitazone or one of the other components, even in patients with liver problems, congestive heart failure or diabetic Ketoaziz (high ketonists - acidspar - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It has been decided that Acettos can serve as part of a monotherapist (for all use) as an alternative to the standard treatment with metformin in patients, where metformin is not displayed.</seg>
<seg id="762">In October 2000, the European Commission informed the company Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited for authorization to run actos in the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">"" "the tablets are white to whitish, round, curved and carry on one side the marking" "" "15" "" "and on the other side the inscription" "" "ACTOS." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazon is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is inadequate and in which metformations is inadequate due to contraindications or incompatibility (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">For the use of pioglitazone in patients under 18 years no data is available, so the use in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients suffering from the presence of at least one risk factor (e.g. early heart attack or symptomatic coronary heart disease), the doctor should start the treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose continuously.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of a heart failure, weight gain or eyelids, especially those with reduced cardiac reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of a heart failure, weight gain and eyelids, if pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular outlet with pioglitazone in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and existing advanced macrorovascular disease has been performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">In this study, an increase in reports of congestive heart failure, which however did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased output liver disease (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range) or with other signs of liver disease, Pioglitazon may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT mirrors are increased to 3 times the upper limit of the standard range, Liver Enzymes are as soon as possible to control.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient develops symptoms occurring on an oral dysfunction, such as unsolved nausea, vomiting, harmonic problems, fatigue, loss of appetite and / or darker harn, these are the liver disease values.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision whether the treatment of the patient with Pioglitazon should be continued, should be guided by the laboratory parameters of clinical assessment.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical trials with Pioglitazone, a dosing-dependent weight gain was detected, which may lead to fat deposits and is related to some cases with fluid retention.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of a havocation at the therapy with Pioglitazon a minor reduction in medium hemoglobinings (relative reduction by 4%) and hematokrits (relative reduction by 4.1%).</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparative controlled trials with pioglitazone in patients under metformin (relative reduction of hemogglobalization around 3-4% and hematokrits around 1-2% and hematocrits (relative reduction of hemogloins around 1-2%) and hematocrits (1-2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin sensitivety in patients, the Pioglitazon as oral or triple combination therapy with insulin-insulin or as two-way combination therapy with insulin, the risk of dosing dependent hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">Following the market launch, under the treatment of Thiazolidindices, including Pioglitazon, on a occurrence or deterioration of a diabetic macular dema with a reduction in visual acuity.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there are direct connection between the intake of Pioglitazon and the occurrence of macular dema, but patients should be aware of the possibility of a macular demon, if patients should report on the visual acuity; a suitable ophthalmological examination should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary of reports of adverse events in randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with over 8,100 patients treated with Pioglitazon were treated.</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated questionnaire was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years, treated with Pioglitazone women and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the PROACTIVE study, a study over 3.5 years to the study of cardiovascular events, fractures were treated with 11 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy, and if a patient is pregnant or entering a pregnancy, the treatment is canceled (see section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies on the investigation of interactions showed that Pioglitazon has no relevant effects on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of Digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interaction with medicines that are metabolized from these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptives, Cyclosporine, calcium-canblocker and HMGCoA-reductasemmer are not expected to be expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous use of pioglitazone with the fibrosis (a cytochrome P450 2C8- inhibitor) resulted in an increase of AUC from Pioglitazon to increase the 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">Simultaneous use of pioglitazone with Rifampicin (a Cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) resulted in a reduction of AUC from Pioglitazon by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the treatment of hyperinsulinemia and increased insulin-resistance of the parent in pregnancy and thereby reduces the availability of metabolic substrates to the federal state growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very common &gt; 1 / 10; often &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 1000; &lt; 1 / 100; seldom &gt; 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, single cases: unknown (from present data not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change of the engine and the index of the lens, as they are also observed in other hypoglycaemic drugs.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical trials with Pioglitazon, ALT attacks on the triple and the upper limit of the norm range frequently occur equally as under placebo, but less commonly used in comparison of metformin or sulfa drugs.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an outcome study in patients with existing advanced macrorovascular disease the frequency of a severe heart failure under Pioglitazone was 1.6% higher than under Placebo when Pioglitazon or in the case.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the market launch, rarely exceeds the heart failure under Pioglitazon, however, more often if Pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin or patients with heart failure in the Anamnese.</seg>
<seg id="795">A summary of reports of adverse events in randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with over 8,100 patients treated in treated groups and over 7,400 patients treated with comparative medication treated groups.</seg>
<seg id="796">Over a period of 3.5 years of the PROACTIVE study, fractures came to 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with Pioglitazone patients treated with 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="797">Taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, then 180 mg / day over seven days were no symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazon seems to work on a activation of specific core receptors (Peroxisome Proliferation) Receptor-γ (PPAR-g)) which leads to an elevated insulin-sensitive treatment of liver, fat and skeleton muscle cells.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitazon reduces the glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose levels in case of insulin resistant.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with Pioglitazon versus Gliclazid as a monotherapeutic was continued over two years to investigate the time of the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 treatment months).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years after the therapy, a blood sugar monitoring (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) was maintained by Pioglitazon at 69% of the patients treated (over 50% of patients under Gliclazid).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled study over 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was inadequately adjusted to insulin or placebo was randomized to Pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under Pioglitazon reduced the mean HbA1c - value to 0.45%, compared to the patients who continue to receive insulin. a reduction of insulin treatment in the treated with Pioglitazon was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">Clinical trials over a year showed a statistically significant decline of the Albumin / Kreatinine-Quotiants compared to the baseline values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of pioglitazone (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was evaluated in a small, 18-week study of type 2 diabetics.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical studies, a reduction in the plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids and a rise in HDL- Cholesterinspiegel, as well as minor, but clinically significant increased LDL- Cholesterinspiegel.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, pioglitazone reduced the overall plasmatriglyceride and the free fatty acids and increased the HDL cholesterol.</seg>
<seg id="808">In comparison to Plazebo found no statistically significant increase in LDL cholesterol, while under metformin and licliclazid were observed.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study over 20 weeks, pioglitazon not only reduced the caustic triglycerides, but also improved triglyceride levels in addition to the triglyceride absorption, as well as on the triglycerides of triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the PROACTIVE study, a cardiovascular disease study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and existing advanced macrorovascular disease were randomised in groups over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular therapy in either Pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral application, Pioglitazone is absorbed quickly, with the peak concentrations of unaltered pioglitazone in the plasma normally takes 2 hours after use.</seg>
<seg id="812">On this basis, the contribution of M-IV represents the efficacy in roughly the threefold of the efficacy of pioglitazone, whereas the relative efficacy of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In intervention trials demonstrated that Pioglitazon has no relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of Digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous use of pioglitazone with the fibrosis (a Cytochrome P450 2C8- inhibitor) or with Rifampicin (a Cytochrome P450 2C8-inductor) or reduces the plasma concentration of pioglitazone (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">According to oral use of radioactive markzed Pioglitazon in humans the marker was found mainly in the case (55%) and a lower extent in the urine (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The mean plasma-elimination time of unaltered Pioglitazone is 5-6 hours, and all the active metabolic rate is 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasma centriculations of Pioglitazon and its metabolites are lower in patients with reduced renal function than with healthy volunteers, but the installments of the oral Clearance of the parent are resemble itself.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies appeared in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys consenting after repeated appointment of plasma, anemia and reversible surgical cardiac hypertrophy.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is attributable to the treatment of hyperinsulinemia and increased insulin-resistance of the parent and thereby reduces the availability of metabolic substrates to the federal state growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years), hyperplasia (in male and female rats) and tumours (in male rats) was induced by the bladder epithelium.</seg>
<seg id="821">In an animal model of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), treatment with two other thiazolidindices led to an increased frequency of colorontological tumors.</seg>

<seg id="823">The calculated questionnaire was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years, treated with Pioglitazone women and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the PROACTIVE study, a study over 3.5 years to the study of cardiovascular events, fractures were treated with 11 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study over two years the effects of a combination therapy of metformin with Pioglitazone or Gliclazid were examined.</seg>
<seg id="826">Clinical trials over 1 year showed a statistically significant decline of the Albumin / Kreatinine Quotiants compared to the baseline values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study over 20 weeks, pioglitazon not only reduced the caustic triglycerides, but also improved triglyceride levels, resulting in a effect on the Tryglyceride absorption, as well as on the Tryglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study was lacking in relation to its primary endpoint, a combination of the total mortality, non-deadly coronartery syndrome, leg amputation above the Knuckles, coronarer Revascularisation and Revascularisation of the leg arteries, lay the results close to ingestion of pioglitazon no cardiovascular long term risks.</seg>

<seg id="873">Patients whose blood sugar is significantly improved by a intensified insulin therapy, the hypoglycaemia warning symptoms can be perceived and should be advised accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="874">Any change in strength, brand (manufacturers), insulin type (fast acting, biphasic, long acting insulin), type of insulin (animal insulin, humaninsulin or insulin) and / or manufacturing method (via recombinant DNA in animal origin) may lead to a change of dosage.</seg>

<seg id="1336">Characteristics in patients with clinical trials have shown that the percentage of alendronat, which is not deposited in bone, is quickly excreted through the urine.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Although no clinical data lies on it, it is estimated that the renal elimination of alkalinity like in animal experiments will also be reduced in patients with reduced renal function.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Therefore, in patients with reduced renal function, a slightly higher Kumulation of Alendronat can be expected in the bone (see Section 4.2).</seg>

<seg id="1428">Dosisizations in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function for maintaining blood mirror in the targeted range can be necessary in patients with severe liver function disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced renal function Since the kidney function exerts no influence on the pharmacokinetics of Tacrolimus, it can be assumed that a dose adaptation is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1430">Due to the nephrotic potential of Tacrolimus, however, careful monitoring of renal function (including a regular determination of the serum increatinspiegel, a calculation of the creatinine and a monitoring of urea volume) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Conversion from Ciclosporin on Advagraf during the conversion from a Ciclosporin to a Tacrolimus-based therapy is advisable (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">Recommendations on the mirror in full blood The dose should be primarily based on the clinical assessment of shock-shock and tolerability in individual case by thoroughbred Tacrolimus-Talks controls.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended to perform frequent checks of the Tacrolimus valley levels during the first two weeks after transplantation, followed by periodic inspections during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood-level mirror of Tacrolimus should also be changed after the conversion from Prograf to Advagraf, dosing adaption, changes of immunosusive therapy or in the same application of substances which could change the Tacrolimus whole blood concentrations (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">Since Advagraf is a drug with a low Clearance, adaptations of the dose may need several days until the Steady State has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The data in clinical studies indicate that a successful treatment is possible in most cases when the blood levels not exceed 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice the valley levels of Tacrolimus are generally found in the first time after liver transplantation in the first time after liver transplantation in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and in glands and heart transplant patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">In general blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were used during subsequent conservation of liver, kidney disease and cardiac transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This led to severe undesired events, including transplantation or other side effects, which can occur in a result of tacrolimus or overlays.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always maintain the same Tacrolimus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage; modification of the formulation or the regime should be performed only under the engaging control of an experienced physician (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>

<seg id="1442">In the childhood prophylaxis of the transplant with adult heart transplant and transplantation in the child's age are not yet clinical data for retarded wording Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Because of possible interaction effects, which can lead to a reduction of tacrolimus in the blood and a weakening of the clinical effect of tacrolimus, is the intake of herbal supplements (Hypericum perforatum), or other herbal remedies during treatment with admiraraf (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea, a particularly careful monitoring of Tacrolimus are offered in the blood, as the Tacrolimus weight levels can be subject to considerable variations in such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases, a chamber or septic hypertrophy was observed under Prograf, which can therefore also occur under Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors enhancing the risk of such clinical disorders, are an already existing heart disease, a treatment with cortiosteroids, hypertension, kidney or liver function, infections, liquid strain and oil.</seg>
<seg id="1447">Like in other immunosuppressants, exposure to sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to suitable clothing or use of a solar control using a high protection factor.</seg>

<seg id="1450">Simultaneous use of medicines or herbal medicines that are known as inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4, can affect or lower the metabolism of Tacrolimus, or reducing blood values by Tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1451">It is therefore advisable to monitor the Tacrolimus weight levels in the same gift of substances that can change the CYP3A metabolism and adjust the Tacrolimus dose for maintaining constant levels (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>

<seg id="1453">Pharmacokinetics studies resulted in increasing blood levels mainly from the elevated oral bioavailability of Tacrolimus, due to the inhibition of gastrointestinal pollution.</seg>
<seg id="1454">High-dose prednisolon or methylprednisolon, as it is used in acute degradation transactions, can increase or lower concentration of tacrolimus in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The effect of Tacrolimus on the metabolism of other drug Tacrolimus is known as the CYP3A4 inhibitor; therefore, the simultaneous application of tacrolimus with medicines, which are metabolized by CYP3A4, can affect the metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Because Tacrolimus can come down the Clearance of steroid-contraceptives and thus increase the hormone levels, is particularly careful with the decisions about receiving sensitive measures.</seg>

<seg id="1468">Because of its high molecular weight, its low water solubility and high bonds to erythrocytes and plasma samples can be assumed that Tacrolimus is not dialyable.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Mechanism of action and pharmacodynamic effects on molecular level will be conveyed by the effects of Tacrolimus through its liaison to a cytosolic protein (FKBP12), which is responsible for enriching the connection in the cell inside.</seg>

<seg id="1486">Patients treated with Tacrolimus were found in 21.7% of cases to produce a bronchiolitis in comparison to 38.0% under Ciclosporin (p = 0.025).</seg>
<seg id="1487">The number of cases in which of Ciclosporin had to be changed to Tacrolimus (n = 13), was significantly larger (p = 0.02), which were converted from Tacrolimus to Ciclosporin (n = 2) (Keenan et al., Ann Thoracic Surg 1995; 60: 580).</seg>
<seg id="1488">The number of cases where there were no acute transplantation in which there was 6 months (57.7% versus 45.8%) and after 1 year (50% versus 33.3%) in the treatment of the Tacrolimus group (Treede et al., J Heart Lung Transplant 2001; 20: 511).</seg>
<seg id="1489">In a study the frequency of the formation of a bronchiolitis was significantly reduced in patients treated with Tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Pancreta transplantation A multi-centric trial was conducted at 205 patients who simultaneously underwent a pancreas and kidney transplantation, which received a randomized process of Tacrolimus (n = 103) or Ciclosporin (n = 102).</seg>
<seg id="1491">The oral initial dose (per protocol) of Tacrolimus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was thereafter to achieve the targeted talent level of 8 to 15 ng / ml on 5.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Intestinal transplant The published clinical results of a monocentric study with oral prograf in 155 patients (65 only intestine, 75 liver and intestine and 25 multi-visceral transplants) showed an update survival rate of 75% after 1 year, 5% after 5 years and 42% after 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="1493">Methods for early detection of Epstein-Barr (EBV) - and CMV infections, bone marquism, supplemental enhancing of Tacrolimus, which lead to talmirrism between 10 and 15 ng / ml and the latest transplantation irradiation (Abu-Elmagd et al., Ann Surg 2001; 234: 404).</seg>
<seg id="1494">Factors such as a low haematocrite and low protein concentrations, which lead to an increase in the disassociated faction of Tacrolimus, or through treatment with cortiosteroids, which should be responsible for transplantation observed higher Clearance Rats.</seg>
<seg id="1495">This suggests that Tacrolimus is almost completely metabolized before the excretion, the excretion is mainly carried out via the bile.</seg>
<seg id="1496">For stable patients suffering from Prograf (twice a day) to Advagraf (once daily) in relation to the total dose of Tacrolimus (AUC0-24), the systemic exposure of Tacrolimus (AUC0-24) was nearly 10% lower than under Prograf.</seg>

<seg id="1530">Advance is used to treat and prevention of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (a hemorrhagulation disorder) caused by the lack of factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1531">The dosage and frequency of the application will be aligned to apply for the treatment of bleeding or to prevent bleeding in surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with haemophilia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency, causing blood clots such as bleeding in joints, muscles or internal organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma, but according to a method described as "recombinant DNA technology":</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced, which it enables to facilitate the formation of the human clutter factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Advancement is similar to another in the European Union called Recombinate, but it is different, so that the medicine contains no proteins of human or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate hisophilia A, including a study with 53 children under six years, the application of the drug was investigated prior to prevention of bleeding and in surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1537">In the main study the efficacy of advances in the prevention of bleeding in 86% of 510% has been awarded with "excellent" or "good."</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common adverse events of Advices (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are dizziness, headaches, pyrexie (fever) and the formation of antibodies over factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">Advices must not be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) against human clotating factor VIII, mouse or hamsterprotein or any of other components.</seg>
<seg id="1540">In March 2004, the European Commission adopted Baxter AG for authorization of Advance in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Dosage: the dose and duration of the subject line therapy is directed by the severity of the factor VIII-deficiency, after the place and the degree of blood and the clinical condition of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1542">For the following hemorrhagic events, the factor VIII activity should not fall under the stated plasma level (in% of the standard or in I.U. / dl).</seg>
<seg id="1543">Injection all 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years) for 3-4 days or longer repeat until the pain and acute impairment has been removed.</seg>
<seg id="1544">Injection all 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years) repeat until the danger is over for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1545">During treatment of treatment, the dose and frequency of injections administered appropriate determination of the factor VIII-Plasmaspiegel.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Individual patients may differ in response to factor VIII, different in vivo recovery and have different half times.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 prophylaxis In the long-term prophylaxis of patients with severe hemophilia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 i.E. by factor VIII per kg body weight in a distance of 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected factor VIII-plasma activity is not achieved or when the bleeding is not controlled with a reasonable dose, a test must be performed to prove a inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitors, it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective, so other therapeutic measures must be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The expected speed should be determined according to the patient, whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">Formation of neutral antibodies (inhibitors) against factor VIII is a well-known complication in the treatment of patients with haemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are always against the procoagulatory activity of factor VIII caused IgG immunoglobulins which are quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml Plasma by modifying Bethesda Assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The risk of developing inhibitors, correlated to the extent of exposure to the factor VIII, where the risk within the first 20 exposure days is on the biggest and genetic and other factors.</seg>
<seg id="1554">In pre-treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 repositioning and anamnetically known influenza product was observed, after switching from a recombinant factor VIII product to another that reappeared from (lowest) inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1555">Due to the rare occurrence of hemophilia A in women there are no experiences about the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and lactation.</seg>
<seg id="1556">The patients, occurring in the largest number of patients, were inhibitors against factor VIII (5 patients), which exhibit a higher risk to the formation of inhibitors, headaches (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).</seg>
<seg id="1557">Very common (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10), sometimes (≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 100), rarely (≥ 1 / 10.000 to &lt; 1 / 100), very rare (frequency based on available data is not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="1558">A) The percentage of patients was calculated using the sum of the individual patients (234)) The unexpected drop of blood clotating factor VIII (10 - 14 postoperatively day) during a patient under continuous ADVATE infusion.</seg>
<seg id="1559">The blood clotting was maintained during the whole period and both the factor VIII- mirrors in the plasma as well as the Clearance Rate showed sufficient values on the 15 postoperative day.</seg>
<seg id="1560">In clinical trials with ADVATE to 145 children and adults 2 with diagnostics (≥ 150 days) and previous exposure to the factor VIII- concentrations (≥ 150 days) showed a low inhibitors (2.4 B.E. in modified Bethesda approach).</seg>
<seg id="1561">In addition, none of the 53 pädiatric patients with an age of less than 6 years and diagnosed with severe hemophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) after previous exposure to factor VIII- concentrations (≥ 50 days) a FVIII inhibitor was noted.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Previously untreated patients of a current clinical study formed 5 of 25 (20%) treated with ADVATE patients treated against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The immune response of the patients on traces of contaminated proteins was analyzed by investigating anti-antibody titres against these proteins, laboratory parameters and reported side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1564">A patient showed both a statistically significant upward trend towards anti-Cho cell protein, but otherwise no signs or symptoms occurred which referred to an allergic reaction or hypersensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="1565">In four patients the occurrence of Urtikaria, Pruritus, ruritus, rash and increased number of eosinophiles were reported in several repetitive products items in the study.</seg>
<seg id="1566">7 How with other intravenous products, ADVATE has been reported on hypersensitivity reactions from the allergic type, including anaphylactic / anaphylactic reactions (frequency not known).</seg>
<seg id="1567">The activated factor VIII acts as a factor for the activated factor IX and accelerates the formation of activated factor X by factor X.</seg>
<seg id="1568">All Pharmacokinetic studies with ADVATE were performed on previously treated patients with severe or moderate hisophilia A (base value of the factor VIII activity ≤ 2%).</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the data available since the initial approval, CHMP has still considered a positive rating, but considering that the safety profile must be closely monitored from the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore, CHMP is based on the basis of the security field of ADVATE, which makes an entry of PSURs every 6 months required, that the authorisation holder should apply for 5 years a further extension procedure.</seg>
<seg id="1640">In December 2008 Gendux Molecular Limited was officially distributed to the Committee on Humanity agents (CHMP), that the company recalls its application for approval of Advexin for the treatment of Li-Fraumeni cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">However, the breast, the brain, the bones or the soft tissues (tissues which connects the other structures in the body) are affected.</seg>
<seg id="1642">This is a kind of virus that has been genetically modified so that it can carry a gene in the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">"" "the virus in Advexin is a" "" "Adenovirus" "" "which has been modified so that there is no copies of itself and therefore no infections can trigger for people." ""</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advexin could have injected directly into the tumours and thus enable the cancer cells to re-form the normal p53 protein.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein that is formed from the non-defect in the human body of the p53 gene, normally contributes to the restoration of damage DNA and to kill the cells when DNA cannot be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="1646">At Li-Fraumeni cancer, where the p53 gene is defective, the p53 protein does not work properly, and the cancer cells continue to grow and share.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company presented data from a study involving a patient, with the Li-Fraumeni cancer, in the field of undermining, in bone and brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP tested the company's answers to the questions, some questions were unsolved.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the initial documents, CHMP has created a list of questions which will be sent to the company by day 120.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to CHMP opinion, the injection of Advexin Li-Fraumeni tumors is not proven to bring benefits to the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The Committee also had concerns relating to the processing of the drug in the body, the type of administration and safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1652">In addition, the company had not proven sufficiently to be established in a reliable manner and that it is neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">"" "the company did not inform the CHMP, whether the withdrawal are consequences for patients currently taking part in clinical trials or" "" "Compassionate" "" "programs with Advexin." ""</seg>

<seg id="1655">Aerobaze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis (hypocrates, caused by an allergy to pollen caused inflammation of the nose) in patients with nasal muctival swelling (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">In adults and adolescents from 12 years the recommended dose of Aerinaze is twice daily a tablet that should be taken entirely with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible, as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucosa (clogged nose), are suspended.</seg>
<seg id="1658">Treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug may be found on the blockage of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main effects were the changes in the severity of the hypocrite symptoms that were reported from patients before the start of treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, patients carried their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and rated a default scale, as heavily the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In case of all locustupfensysymptoms but the blockage of the nose reported the patients who came to aeronautics, over a decrease of symptoms by 46.0%, compared with 35.9% in the patients receiving pseudoephedrine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was considered, the patients under Aerobaze showed a relieving of symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% in patients who had desloratadin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of Aerobaze (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are speedometer, dizziness, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity (lack of appetite), fostering, headache, fatigue, insomnia (insomnia), somnolence (sleepiness), insomnia and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerobaze may not be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) against desloratadine, pseudoephedrine or any of the other components, against repinephrine agents or lauatadin (another medicine for the treatment of allergies) are not used.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerinaze can also not be used in patients that suffer from a narrow-angle glaucoma (hypertension), cardiovascular disease (hypertension), hypertension (hypertension), or even a risk of hemorrhagic stroke (cerebral hemorrhage), or a risk of hemorrhagic stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007 the European Commission granted the company SP Europe approval for the Intraffic of Aerobaze in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, however, is to be swallowed (i.e. without them to crush or chew).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aerinaze should not be applied to children under 12 years due to the lack of data for unquestionable and efficacy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the end of the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days, since long-term application can take the activity of pseudoephedrine at the time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After the decrease of mugous membranes in the upper respiratory tract, treatment can be continued with desloratadin as a monotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Since Aerobaze contains Pseudoephedrine, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients who are treated with a monoamoxidase (MAO) inhibitor or within 2 weeks after the termination of such therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is attributable to alphamimetic activity in combined application of pseudoephedrine with other vasoonstructions such as Bromocripitin, Pergoydroergotamine or other Decongestiva, the peroral or nasal as aborted Rhino (phenylpropanolamine, phenylephrine, ephedrine, Naphazard etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">Safety and effectiveness of this combination therapy were not examined for this patient collective, and the data are not sufficient to express appropriate recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Safety and the efficacy of aeronautics were not checked in patients with kidney or liver function, and the data is not sufficient to express appropriate recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients need to be informed about the treatment of a hypertension or speedometer, or of palpitations, arrhythmia, nausea or any other neurological symptoms (like headaches or a gain of the headaches).</seg>
<seg id="1677">Care of the following patient groups will be careful: • Patients under digitalis "patients with heart rhythm disorders - patients with hypertonia • patients with a myocardial infarction in the Anamnese, diabetes mellitus, bladder or bronchospasm in the Anamnese.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aeronauaze is to suspend at least 48 hours prior to performing dermatological tests, since antihistamines can prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions or reduce in its magnitude.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In the context of clinical exams with desloratadine, in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were added, however, no clinically relevant interactions or change of the plasma concentration of Desloratadin were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">In the results of the psychomotor tests, there were no significant differences between patients treated with placebo and placebo-treated patients regardless of whether desloratadin alone or alcohol was taken.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme Q10 has not yet been identified for the metabolism of Desloratadin, so that interactions with other medicines cannot be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadin inhibits in-vivo CYP3A4, and in vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 is not inhibits and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoprotein.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The insolvency of the application of aerobaze during pregnancy is not secured, yet gained experience from a large number of affected pregnancies, however, no increase in frequency of abnormalities in comparison to the frequency of normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since reproduction studies on animals are not always transferred to humans and due to vascular properties of pseudoephedrine, Aerobaze should not be applied in the pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">"" "" "" "the patients should be clarified, however, that it may result in very rare cases that may lead to a impairment of perseverity or ability to serve machines." ""</seg>

<seg id="1689">These include both inhibiting of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13, IL-8, IL-8, IL-8, IL-8 and IL-13 of human master cells and the expression of the adhesion smolecüls P-seltin on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">In a single dose-dose of adults, Desloratadin showed no influence on standard measuring sizes of fluorestation including amplification of subjective drowsiness or the tasks that are connected to the flies.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical studies, the recommended dosage of 5 mg. daily was no increased frequency of drowsiness compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of pseudoephedrine in the recommended dosage can cause further sympathetic effects, such as an increase in blood pressure, a speedometer or manifestations of a ZNS arousal.</seg>
<seg id="1693">It took 1,248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rhinitis, whereby 414 patients received Aerinaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies the histamantagonistic efficacy of Aerinaze tablets, determined by the total cores for symptoms (except nasal muctival swelling), significantly higher than under a monotherapy with pseudoephedrine over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The efficacy of Aerinaze tablets with regard to the swelling effect, determined on the basis of the nasal muctival swelling, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with desloratadin over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The effectiveness of Aerinaze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender, age or ethnic origin.</seg>
<seg id="1697">As part of a single dose study on Pharmacokinetics of Aerobaze, Desloratadin is demonstrable within 30 minutes after administration.</seg>
<seg id="1698">Following the peroral application of Aerobaze with healthy subjects over 14 days, the flow of the flow of Desloratadin, 3-hydroxydesloratadine and pseudoephedrine was reached on Day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">In the framework of a pharmacokinetic multi-dosing study, which was performed with formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects, was found that four female subjects desloratadin were badly damaged.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component interactions study shows that exposure (Cmax and AUC) of pseudoephedrine according to the sole gift of Pseudoephedrine was the exposition to the gift of an Aerinist tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on conventional studies on safety macology, toxicity with repeated gift, for genotoxicity and for reproduction, the pre-clinical data with Desloratadin discusses no special dangers for man.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination had no greater toxicity as its individual components, and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredient pseudoephedrine.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductioning clinical studies, the combination of Loratadin / pseudoephedrine was not termed up in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and on rabbits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day.</seg>

<seg id="1722">Aerius was evaluated in a total of eight studies involving approximately 4 800 adults and juveniles with allergic rhinitis (including four trials in seasonal rhinitis and two studies of patients who also had asthma patients).</seg>
<seg id="1723">Efficacy was measured by changing the symptoms (itching, number and size of addling, impairment of sleep and performance on days) before and after six weeks of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies have been presented to prove that the body uses the syrup, the solution to insert and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and application in children is harmless.</seg>
<seg id="1725">Allergic rhinitis carried out when the results of all trials were considered, the two-week treatment with 5 mg Aerius was given an average decrease of symptoms (symptoms) of 25 to 32%, compared with the decrease of 12 to 26% in patients who received a placebo.</seg>

<seg id="1737">The most frequent adverse events that were reported more frequently than in placebo were fatigue (1,2%), harmonica (0.8%) and headaches (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical study with 578 young patients from 12 to 17 years the most common side of headaches, this occurred at 5.9% of patients who were treated with desloratadin, and 6.9% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">In a multi-dose study, with up to 45 mg of desloratadine (ninety clinical dose), no clinically relevant effects were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes both inhibiting of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13, IL-8, IL-8, IL-8, IL-8 and IL-13 of human master cells and the expression of the adhesion smolecüls P-seltin on endothelial cells.</seg>

<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius was effective in relieving symptoms such as nieses, nostrils and itching of the nose, itching, lacrivation and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in saisonal and perennial, an allergic rhinitis can be divided in dependence on the duration of symptoms alternatively also in intermittent allergic rhinitis and persistent allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persistent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As demonstrated by the total cores of the questionnaire to life of life in Rhino-ligtivitis, Aerius effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronic idiopathic uraria was investigated as a representative for further forms of urine, because the underlying pathophysiology is disregarded as the underlying pathology in different forms and chronic patients can be recruited easier.</seg>
<seg id="1750">Since the histamine release is a causal factor in all primary diseases, is expected to improve the loratadine in other forms of urine to improve the symptoms; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic uraria, Aerius was effective in improving Pruritus and the reduction of size and number of addling at the end of the first dosisintervalls.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistamines in chronic idiopathic uraria the minority of patients who did not react to antihistamines, was excluded from the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">Improvement of the itentives around more than 50% was observed with 55% of patients treated with desloratadin treated patients treated with placebo-treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Treatment with Aerius reduced the disturbance of sleep and growth as it was measured by a 4-point scale to assess the variable.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmacokinetics study, in which patients with the general seasonally allergic rhinitis-population was comparable, 4% of patients achieved a higher concentration of Desloratadine.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no clustering points for clinically relevant couplings after once daily application of Desloratadine (5- 20 mg) over 14 days.</seg>

<seg id="1759">In a single dosing study with desloratadine in a dose of 7.5 mg, meals (fetal, low-calory breakfast) did not affect the availability of Desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1760">The clinical studies carried out with the desloratadin and Loratadin study showed a comparable degree of exposure of desloratadine, no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxicity studies by Desloratadin and Loratadin.</seg>

<seg id="1764">The prescription doctor should be aware that most cases of Rhinitis is caused by infection in children under 2 years (see section 4.4) and that no data suggest that support an infection of infectious rhinitis with Aerius.</seg>
<seg id="1765">In addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatomical anomalies, the diagnosis, physical investigations and appropriate laboratory and skin tests should play a role.</seg>
<seg id="1766">For about 6% of adults and children between 2 and 11 years of age, desloratadine is restricted and experienced a higher level of substrate (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1767">The safety of Aerius Sirup in children between 2 and 11 years, who are limited metabolized, is identical to children who are normal metabolized.</seg>

<seg id="1775">Because the course of allergic rhinitis / chronic idiopathic uraria and the profile of Desloratadin is similar in adults and children, the efficacy data of Desloratadin can be extrapolated in adults to the children's population.</seg>
<seg id="1776">In the context of a clinical study of multiple adults and juveniles, in the desloratadine in a dose of up to 20 mg has been applied daily for 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>
<seg id="1777">In a clinically pharmacological study of adults and juveniles, in the desloratadine in a dose of 45 mg. a day (the Neunfold of the clinical dose) was applied more than ten days in adults, no extension of the QTc interval was found.</seg>
<seg id="1778">In controlled clinical trials the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and teenagers had no increased frequency of drowsiness compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1779">For a single daily dose of 7,5 mg, Aerius tablets resulted in clinical trials to no impairment of the psychomotor.</seg>
<seg id="1780">In clinical pharmacological studies on adults, alcohol was neither a reinforcement of alcohol-induced performance detailing to increase drowsiness.</seg>
<seg id="1781">In adult and adolescent patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius tablets were effective in relieving symptoms such as nieses, nostrils and itching of the nose, itching, lacrivation and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1782">As with the total cores of the questionnaire to life of life in Rhino-ligtivitis, Aerius tablets effectively reduced the allergic allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1783">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic uraria, Aerius was effective in improving Pruritus and the reduction of size and number of addling at the end of the first dosisintervalls.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The spread of this limited metabolious phenotyps was comparable to adults (6%) and children between 2 and 11 years (6% adults, 16% children) than with Caucasians (2% adults, 3% children).</seg>
<seg id="1785">Similar pharmacokinetic parameters were observed in a pharmacokinetic multi-dose study with syupformulation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rhinitis, which are generally metabolized, observed.</seg>

<seg id="1912">This drug ashonavir increased drug Agenerase has been compared with 206 adults who previously used Protease inhibitors to be compared with other Protease Indies.</seg>
<seg id="1913">The main indikator for the effectiveness was the proportion of patients with non-detectable concentration of HIV in the blood (viral load) or the change of viral load after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In studies with patients who previously had not taken a protease inhibitor, even after 48 weeks under Agenerase, more patients had a viral load of 400 copies / ml than under Placebo, but Agenerase was less effective than Indinavir.</seg>

<seg id="1946">Because the fuel change of the HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitor and Simvastatin is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, is not recommended for an simultaneous stopping of antigen with Lovastatin and Simvastatin because of the increased risk of myopopathies including Rhabometyolysis.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some medicines that can cause severe or life-threatening side effects, such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under supervision of International normalized Ratio), methods are available to determine the active concentration.</seg>
<seg id="1948">For patients who use this medicine at the same time, aspirase may be less effective due to a reduced plasma level of Amendavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with Amendavir, the efficacy of hormonal contraceptives may be altered, however, the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interaction.</seg>
<seg id="1950">If methadone is given at the same time with Amendavir, patients should therefore be monitored on opiatentric symptoms, especially if there are still low doses of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Due to the possible risk of toxicity, due to the high propyl glycolt solution of the Agenerase solution, this formulation form is contraindicated in children under an age of four years and should be used with care in certain other patient groups.</seg>

<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrates with low therapeutic width Ageneration may not be given simultaneously with medicines, which represent a low therapeutic width and also substrates the cytochrome P450-Isoenzms 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with low therapeutic width Ageneration with knonavir must not be used together with medicines, their active ingredients are primarily associated with CYP2D6 and are linked to increased plasma and / or life-threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It was shown that Rifampicin causes a 82% reduction in AUC of Amendavir which can lead to an astrological failure and to a resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In the attempt, the reshaping plasma hedgehogs caused by a dose increase of other protease inhibitors in combination with Ritonavir have been observed very often unwanted effects on the liver.</seg>
<seg id="1963">St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) The serum levels of Amendavir can be induced by the simultaneous use of plant preparations with currant wort (Hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If a patient already decreases St. John's wort, the Amendavirus comes and if possible to check the viral load and depose St. John's wort.</seg>
<seg id="1965">A dose adjustment for one of the drug is not necessary if Nelfinavir is administered together with Amendavir (see also Eterirenz below).</seg>

<seg id="1968">52% decreases when Amendavir (750 mg twice daily) combined with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily) was given.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of Amendavir (600 mg twice daily) with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily) were achieved in combination with 100 mg Ritonavir (600 mg twice daily) in combination with 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1970">A dosing dosage for the simultaneous administration of Amendavir and Kaletra can not be given, but it is not recommended to use narrowing monitoring since its effectiveness and immunity of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">There was no pharmacokinetic study on the use of andano in combination with didanosin, but is recommended because of the antazione component of didanosin, however, that the revenue of didanosin and asgeneric gases are at least one hour apart. (see Antacids below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore, in combination with amiraboons (600 mg twice daily) and Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) and Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) no dosisadjustment is required.</seg>
<seg id="1973">The treatment with the irradiotherapy in combination with Amendavir and Saquinavir is not recommended, as the exposure of both protease inhibitors would degrade.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effects of Nevirapin to other protease inhibitors and existing limited data suggest that Nevirapine may be sunk into the serum concentration of Amendavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If these medicines should be used simultaneously, caution is advisable because Delavirdin is less effective because of the reduced or possibly subtherapeutic plasma concentration.</seg>
<seg id="1976">When this drug is used together, caution is advisable; a thorough clinical and virology monitoring is to be made, as a precise prediction of the effects of the combination of Amendavir and Ritonavir is difficult at Delavirdin.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous gift of Amendavir and Rifabutin led to an increase in plasma concentration of 193% (AUC) of Rifabutin to increase the side effects associated with Rifabutin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is required for clinical reasons, Rifabutin combined with Agenerase is recommended to reduce the dose of Rifabutin at least half of the recommended dose, although no clinical data can be found.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies with aspirin in combination with erythromycin were not performed, but the plasma reflection of both medicines could be increased in the case of concurrent administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg of cosampavir and 100 mg Ritonavir with 200 mg ketoconazole once daily resulted in a increase of cetoconazole on 2,69times compared to the value that was observed after 200 mg ketoconazole once daily with no simultaneous use of Fosamputavir with Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other medicines that are listed below, including substrates, inhibitor or inductors of CYP3A4, can be applied together with aspirase may lead to interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Patients should therefore be based on toxic reactions which are combined with these medicines, if they are applied in combination with aspirase.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data of other proteases, it is advisable that Antacids are not taken at the same time as aspirase may occur as it may come to resorption.</seg>
<seg id="1984">The simultaneous use of anticonvulsva that are known as enzymes (phenytoin, phenobarbital, phenobarbital, carbamazepine), with Amresistavir can lead to a lower level of plasma reflection of Amendavir.</seg>
<seg id="1985">The serum concentration of calcium-channel blockers such as Amlodipin, dipin pin, nifpin, Nimodipine, nifedipin, Nimodipine, Nisoldipin and Verapamil can be increased 10 by Amendavir, which may increase the activity and toxicity of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1986">Simultaneous ingestion with Agenerase may increase their plasma centriculations and amplify with PDE5 inhibitors in conjunction with the PDE5 inhibitors in conjunction with hypotacetic, visual disturbances and primapism (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical study, in the Ritonavir 100 mg capsules twice daily with 50 µg of fluid propionate intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days of subjects were reduced by approximately 86% (90% -convection interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">As a result, the simultaneous gift of Amounase with Ritonavir is not recommended with these glucores coids, unless the potential benefits of treatment systemic cortiosteroy (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">At HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, which depends heavily from CYP3A4, increased enhancements of plasma screens with simultaneous increase of Amounase.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Since plasma cutting increases of these HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitor can lead to myopathy including a Rhabometyolysis, the combined application of this drug is not recommended with Amendavir.</seg>
<seg id="1991">There is a frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations as recommended as stabilisation of the mirrors, as the plasma centriculations of Cyclosporine, Rapamycin and Tacrolimus can be increased by the same gift of Amendavir (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore Amounase may not be applied together with orally collected midazolam (see section 4.3), while in the same application of Agenerase with parenteral Midazolam caution is advisable.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data on the simultaneous use of parenteral Midazolam with other proteinase inhibitors indicate a possible increase in the plasma level by Midazolam for 3 to 4 times.</seg>
<seg id="1994">If methadone is administered together with Amendavir, patients should therefore be supervised on opiatentric symptoms, especially if there are still low doses of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Because of the maximum reliability of historical comparisons, there is currently no recommendation to be adjusted, such as the Amorphan dose can be adjusted simultaneously with methadone.</seg>
<seg id="1996">In the same gift of warfarin or other oral antibodies along with Agenerase, a stronger control of INR (International normalised debt ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of a weakening or amplification of the antithrombotic effect (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of Ritonavir on hormonal contraceptives is not predictable, so alternative methods are recommended to contraception.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example, Desipramine and Normal fertility) is recommended for the same gift of anticase (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">This medicine may be used only after the pregnancy of the possible use of the possible usefulness in comparison to the possible risks for the fetus.</seg>

<seg id="2016">Amendavir binds to the active centre of HIV-1 protease and prevents the procession of viral gags- and gag-pol- polyproteination steps with the result of an assailant, non-infectious viral particles.</seg>
<seg id="2017">The antiviral activity of Amendavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was studied both in acute and chronic lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) and peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% Hemmkonzentration (IC50) of Amendavir lies in the range from 0,012 to 0.08 µM in acute cells and is 0,41 µM in chronic infected cells</seg>
<seg id="2019">The connection between the activity of Amendavir against HIV-1 in vitro and the inhibition of HIV-1 replication in humans is not yet defined.</seg>
<seg id="2020">In treating antiretroviral untreated patients with the currently permitted Fosamputavir / Ritonavir-Dosip - such as other knonavian inhibitors with proteinase inhibitors - the mutations described only rarely were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2021">Sixteen patients treated with 434 antiretroviral patients treated twice daily in the study ESS100732 twice a day in the study ESS100732, where 14 isolate genotypic could be investigated.</seg>

<seg id="2024">In the APV3003 study and its extension APV30005 (700 mg of cosamputavir / 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily: n = 107) patients treated with virology charts over 96 weeks, the following Protease inhibitor mutations appeared:</seg>
<seg id="2025">Based on genotypic resistance analysis, Genotypic interpretations can be used to estimate the activity of Amendavir / Ritonavir / Ritonavir / Ritonavir for patients with protease inhibitor-resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11-algorithm for Fosamputavir / Ritonavir defines resistance as the presence of mutations L10F / I, L33F, I36A / C / F / G, I84V and L90M in combination with a increased peripheral resistance to Fosamputavir with a reduced probability of a virology response (resistence).</seg>
<seg id="2027">The conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mutations or mutations can be subject to additional data, and it is recommended to always attract current interpretations to analyze the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">Based on phenotypic resistance analysis, clinically validated phenotypic interpretations can be used in conjunction with the genotypic data on the assessment of the activity of Amendavir / Ritonavir / Ritonavir / Ritonavir for patients with protease inhibitor-resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies to drive diagnostic resistance tests have been developed clinically-phenotypic cut-offs (separations) for FPV / RTV, which can be used for interpretation of a resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to Amendavir associated genetic patterns creates a certain crossresistance to Ritonavir, the sensitivity to Indinavir, Nelfinavir and Saquinavir remains generally preserved.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data on the cross-resistence between Amendavir and other protease inhibitors for all 4 Fosamputr Resistor, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">On the basis of twenty-five antiretroviral non-treated patients (one of which showed a resistance to Lopinavir / Ritonavir (three of 25 isolates), Indinavir / Ritonavir (three of 24 isolates), caquinavir / Ritonavir (three of 24 isolates), saviavir / Ritonavir (three of 24 isolates) and Tipranavir / Ritonavir (three of 24 isolates) and Tipranavir / Ritonavir (four of 24 isolates).</seg>
<seg id="2033">Vice versa, Amendavir keeps his activity against some other Protease inhibitors inhibitor-resistant isolates; the receipt of these activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">Early departure of a failed therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mutations in boundaries that can trigger the subsequent treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The evidence of the effectiveness of Amounase in combination with knonavir 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO30017 (100 mg twice daily) and nucleoside aloga (NRTI) or a standard therapy (standard of care, SOC) with a PI, mainly with low-rated knonavir. "</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred and sixty-threescore (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity to Amounase, at least one other PI and at least one NRTI included in the study study A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis provided the non-sub-balance of APV / Ritonavir compared to the period adjusted average (AAUCMB) in the viral load (HIV-1 RNA) in the Plasma-1 RNA (HIV-1 RNA) in a non-drug shaft of 0.4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The evidence of the effectiveness of untreated Ageneration is based on two uncontrolled trials with a total of 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18, of which 152 will be treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies, Agenerase solution was used twice daily, 20 mg / kg three times daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily, with the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">There was no low dozed knonavir at the same time; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously had at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the NRTIs.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks, the patients included a plasma-HIV-1 RNA concentration of &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase of CD4 cell numbers of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74).</seg>

<seg id="2043">After oral administration, the mean duration (tmax) to the maximum serum concentration of Amendavir is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">508% increased, for Cmax by 30% reduced when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered together with ambasavir (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of Amendavir with a meal leads to a 25% decrease of AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of Amendavir 12 hours after dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">The minimum concentration in the Steady State (Cmin, ss) of food intake remained unaffected, although the amount of food influences the extent and rates of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume is about 430 l (6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg) and can be placed on a large distribution volume as well as an unhinted penetration of Amendavir from the bloodstream into the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the overall concentration of the active ingredient in the plasma, with the amount of inbound Amendavir, which represents the active proportion which remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While the absolute concentration of unbound Amendavir remains constant, the percentage of free active components during dosing intervalls in the Steady-State during the Cmax, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore, medicines, the CYP3A4 induce or inhibits or a substrate of CYP3A4, should be given caution when they are given simultaneously with aspirase (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The gift of Amounase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily, leads to a similar daily amatavir exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Amendavir is available from the solution 14% less bioverfeed than from the capsules; hence Agenerase solution and Agenerate capsules are not interchangeable on a milligrammbase.</seg>
<seg id="2053">The renal Clearance of Ritonavir is also negligible, so the effect of a kidney function might be minimal on the elimination of Amendavir and Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2054">These treatment schemata are similar to those who are based on healthy volunteers following a dose of 1200 mg Amendavir twice daily without the simultaneous administration of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2055">In long-term studies in mice with amatavir in mice and rats appeared in male animals benigne (mice) or 3,8- multiple (rat) of exposure to people, after twice a daily gift of 1200 mg Amendavir, spoke.</seg>
<seg id="2056">The 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of ocell-cell carcinomas and carcinomas has not yet been resolved and the relevance of these observed effects for man is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="2057">However, there are little evidence for the adoption of a clinical relevance of this findings from the present study data on humans, both from clinical studies and therapeutic use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">In a standard battery of in-vivo- and in-vitro genotoxification tests, the bacterial reverse mutation tests (amit test), optic nerve tests on rats and chromosome aberratic tests on human peripheral lymphocytes were neither mutagenic nor genotoxic.</seg>
<seg id="2059">These liver toxicity can be observed and proven by the measurement of AST, ALT and the activity of alkaline phosphatase.</seg>
<seg id="2060">So far, clinical trials have not observed no significant liver toxicity in patients, neither during the administration of asgeneric gases, nor after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2061">Studies on toxicity in young animals, which were treated at an age of 4 days, showed a high mortality in the control of the control and with the Amendavir animals.</seg>
<seg id="2062">In a systematic plasma concentration, which was significantly lower (rabbits) or not significantly higher (rats) than the expected exposure under therapeutic dosage, however, a number of minor changes, including thymus ongation and minor skeletal changes, were observed in a delayed development.</seg>
<seg id="2063">24 If Amounase Capsules can be applied without the intensifying addition of Ritonavir (Booemy), need to apply higher doses to Amounase (1200 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2064">The recommended dose for AGenerase capsules is 20 mg ambavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral pharmaceuticals up to a daily dose of 2400 mg Amendavir which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Simultaneous application should be observed in patients with weak or light liver function with caution, in patients with severe liver function, it is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2066">26 For some medicines that can cause severe or life-threatening side effects, such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under supervision of International normalized Ratio), methods are available to determine the active concentration.</seg>

<seg id="2234">A minimum systemic recording of the 5% Imiquimodine-cream through the skin of 58 patients with actinic keratosis was observed during the three weekly use during 16 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2235">The highest drug conconcentrations in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and lived in the face in the face (12.5 mg, 1 disposable bags), on the scalp (25 mg, 2 bags) and on the hands / arms (75 mg, 6 bags).</seg>
<seg id="2236">The calculated obvious half-life was about 10times higher than the 2-hour half-time after subcutaneous use in an earlier study; it indicates an extended retention of the drug in the skin.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Data to systemic exposure showed that the Resorption of Imiquimod was low in patients at the age of 6 - 12 years and comparable to that of healthy adults and adults with acute keratosis or super-targeted basal cell carcinoma.</seg>
<seg id="2238">In a four-month study of dermal toxicity at the rat, doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased spleen weight; another four months carried out a study at the mouse yielded no similar effects.</seg>
<seg id="2239">A two-year study involving carcinogenicity in mice during three days a week induced no tumors at the application site.</seg>
<seg id="2240">The corresponding mechanism is not known, but since Imiquimod has only a small systemic absorption of human skin and not mutages, is a risk for humans due to systemic exposure as very low.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The tumors came in the group of mice, treated with the real-free crème, sooner and in larger numbers than in the control group with low UVR.</seg>

<seg id="2271">Aldurazyme is used to treat patients with vented diagnosis of a Mujahysacchariot I (MPS I; α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (the symptoms that do not stand with brain or nerves in connection).</seg>
<seg id="2272">This means that certain substances (glycoheroglycanes, Gags) will not be mined and thus accumulate in most organs in the body and damage it.</seg>
<seg id="2273">The following non-neurological symptoms of MPS I can occur: enlarged liver, stiff joints, the movements complicate, diminished lung volume, heart and eye diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2274">Treatment with alkalazyme should be monitored by a doctor, who owns the experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other hereditary metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2275">The administration of Aldurazyme should take place in a hospital or hospital with revitalizing equipment, and the patients need appropriate medicines to prevent an allergic reaction.</seg>

<seg id="2277">In the study, mainly the safety of the drug was investigated, however, its effectiveness measured (by its effect in relation to reduction of gag concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver was studied).</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under five years Aldurazyme killed the gag concentrations in the urine by approximately 60%, and half of the treated children showed a normal big liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common side effects of Aldurazyme in patients at the age of over five years (observed with more than 1 of 10 patients) are headaches, nausea, abdominal pain, arthraloarthritis (joint pain), back pain, pain in limbs (in hands and feet), heat feeling, fever and reactions at the infusion point.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very common side effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure, reduced oxygen saturation (measuring size of lung function), speedometer (accelerated heart rate), fever and chills.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyme may not react sensitively (allergic) on laronidase or one of the other components (anaphylactic reaction), not applied.</seg>
<seg id="2282">Each year, the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) is updated every year, which may possibly be announced, check and update this summary if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The manufacturer of Aldurazyme is given to patients who observe alkalazyme in terms of reactions to infusion and development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission granted the company Genzyme Europe B.V. authorization for the transport of Aldurazyme throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of human α -L-Iduronidase and is produced by recombinant DNA technology using Cho-mammal cells (Chinese Hamster Ovary, derived from the Chinese hamsters).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is indicated for long-term enzyme therapy in patients with secured diagnosis of a Mujahysacchariot I (MPS I, α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">Treatment with Aldurazyme should be carried out by a physician, who owns the experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other hereditary metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased when the patient is carrying out all 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 e / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and effectiveness of Aldurazyme in adults over 65 years has not been determined, and no dosing scheme can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Safety and effectiveness of Aldurazyme in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined, and for these patients no dosing scheme can be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients treated with alkalazyme can develop infusion-related reactions which are defined as each associated with effect, which occurs during infusion or until the end of the infusion process (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, especially those patients should continue to be closely monitored, and the infusion of Aldurazyme should only be made available in a reasonable clinical environment, where revitational facilities for medical emergencies are available.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical phase 3 study, almost all patients IgG antibodies against Laronidase are generally formed, usually within 3 months from treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of infusion-related reaction must be treated with caution (see sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">Because little experience in resumption of treatment after a lengthy disruption, has to be careful due to the theoretical risk reaction after an interruption of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2296">60 minutes before the beginning of infusion with medication (antihistamines and / or antipyherka) to minimize the potential occurrence of infusion-related reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In case of an easy or moderate infusion-related reaction, the treatment of antihistamines and paracetamol / Ibuprofen was to be considered and / or a reduction in the infusion rate to the half of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In case of a single, severe infusion-related reaction, infusion must be stopped until the symptoms are brought to decline, treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / Ibuprofen is weakened.</seg>
<seg id="2299">The infusion can be resumed with a reduction in the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate when the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 (antihistamines and paracetamol / Ibuprofen and / or corticosteroids) and a reduction in the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate, occurring in the previous reaction.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be applied at the same time with chloroquin or Procain, because there is a potential risk of inference with the intracellular surface of laronidase.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Experimental studies do not depend on direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, the embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since there are no data to newborns that exposed to Laronidase, above the breast milk, it is recommended to breastfeeding the treatment with Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2304">The effects of clinical trials were mainly classified as infusion-related reactions which were observed in 53% of patients in phase 3 study (treatment duration of up to 4 years) and 35% of patients with participants under 5 years (treatment duration up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Undesirable drug interactions in connection with Aldurazyme that were observed during the Phase 3 study and its extension in a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 or older in a treatment duration of up to 4 years (≥ 1 / 10); frequently (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-related participation of the upper respiratory system and lungs in prehistory, moreover, severe reactions came up, including bronchospasm, respiratory and visual acuity (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children undesired drug interactions in connection with Aldurazyme that were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients in the age of 5, with mainly heavy traffic form and a duration of treatment up to 12 months, listed in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenously once weekly (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">In most patients, patients received a serum version during the age of 3 months, with a severe vanishing form mostly in the age of 5 years (average after 26 days over 45 days with patients at the age of 5 and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">By the end of the Phase 3 study (or until a premature retirement from the study), there were no strable antibodies for 13 / 45 patients (RIP) Assay demonstrable antibodies, among them 3 patients with which it never appeared to seroonates.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with infant until low anti-antibody mirrors have been demonstrated to a robust reductions in the gag, while patients with high antibody titres was a variable reduction of Gag in the Harn.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in the phase 3 study and one in the Phase 2 study) showed a marginal and low-neutralising effect on the enzymatic Laronidase- activity in vitro, which seemed to affect clinical efficacy and / or the reduction of Gag in the urine.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies seemed not to be associated with the incidence of undesired pharmaceuticals, even if the occurrence of adverse drug reactions might typically fall together with the formation of IgG anti-antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Reasoning for the enzyme is in one for the hydrolysis of the accumulated substrates and preventing further accumulation of an enzyme.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After intravenous infusion, laronidase is quickly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the lyphosomes, most likely about manic-6-phosphate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">Safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme were randomised in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study to 45 patients at the age of 6 to 43 years.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study, the majority of patients were identified by the mean phenotype and a patient showed the heavy phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited when they had a forcted expiratory volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the value expected and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the expected FEV and absolute distance in the 6-minute test.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were then recruited for an open-label extension study, where they received 100 E / kg Aldurazyme every week (182 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy the patients treated with Aldurazyme treated an improvement of lung function and the hearing on which is shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">The open renewal study showed an improvement and / or maintaining these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme / Aldurazyme group and 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazyme group as shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease of the expected percentage of FEV is not significant over this period of clinically significant and absolute lung-volumes increased significantly to the height of body-growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of 26 patients with a hepatatomic absorption of treatment 22 (85%) to the end of the study a normal liver image.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks, a significant drop of the Gag levels in the Harn (µg / mg of Creatinine) was observed, which remained constant until the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">Regarding the heterogeneous disease manifestation between the patients suffering from a combined end point, clinically significant changes in the 6-minute walk test, movement of the shoulder blade ancesti and visual acuity) was generally an improvement in 26 patients (22%) and a deterioration in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">A one year old open phase 2 study was conducted, mainly the safety and pharmacokinetics of Aldurazyme in 20 patients who were enrolled at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years (16 patients with severe form-form and 4).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg due to increased GAG- mirrors in the Harn in week 22.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients, a size of size (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) and a weight gain (n = 3) and all 4 patients with the mean follow-up form demonstrated a normal mental development speed, whereas the elderly patients were limited to a limited, limited or no progress in cognitive development.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a Phase 4 study, research into pharmacodynamics effects of various Aldurazyme dosing schemata were carried out on the gag levels in the Harn, the liver volume and the 6-minute walk test.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenously once weekly (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dosing scheme with 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks can be found in patients who have difficulties with weekly infusions, however, is not proven that the long-term clinical efficacy of these two dosizing schemata is equivalent.</seg>
<seg id="2333">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will provide any new information available, rate annually, and if necessary, the summary of the characteristics of the drug may be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2334">The pharmacokinetic profile in patients under the age of 5 was similar to those in elderly and less affected patients.</seg>

<seg id="2520">It is recommended to meet additional fluctuating measures in order to prevent the possible failure of oral contraceptions (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2521">Both in a study on exchange effects of medicines and in several cases with the same application of orlistat and Ciclosporin a decrease of Ciclosporin plasma was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2522">If using warfarin or other oral antibodies in combination with orlistat the Quick-Values (International normalizable, INR) could be affected (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2523">In most patients who were treated with orlistat in clinical trials up to 4 full years, the concentrations of vitamins A, D, E and K and beta-carotins remained in the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2524">However, the patient should be recommended to take a supplementary multivitamin preparate to ensure adequate vitamine intake (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2525">Based on the gift of one-time dose of Amiodaron, a minor decrease in the Amiodaron plasma concentration was observed at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="2526">Experimental studies showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2527">The side effects of orlistat are mainly gastrointestinal natural and hanging with the pharmacological effects of the drug, as the absorption of captured fat is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2528">The gastrointestinal side effects were obtained from clinical trials with orlistat 60 mg over a duration of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporarily.</seg>
<seg id="2529">The frequencies are defined as follows: very frequent (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100), rarely (≥ 1 / 10.000, &lt; 1 / 100) and very rare (frequency based on available data is not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="2530">The incidence of known adverse events that were noted after the market launch of orlistat is not known since these events were voluntarily reported by a population of some extent.</seg>
<seg id="2531">† It is plausible that treatment with alli can lead to anxiety related to possible or actual gastrointestinal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Single doses of 800 mg orlistat and multiple outlets of up to 400 mg three times daily were administered over a period of 15 days to normal and overweight subjects without any significant clinical findings.</seg>
<seg id="2533">In the majority of orlistat overdose, either side-effects or similar side effects were reported on either side effects, such as the recommended dose of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Based on investigations on human and animal, systemic effects can be derived from a quick regression of any systemic effects, which are attributable to the lipasian properties of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The therapeutic effect takes place in the lumen of Magens and the upper thin-intestine by covalent bonds to the active Serin-Rest of the gastric and pancreatic lipasen.</seg>
<seg id="2536">From clinical trials, that 60 mg of orlistat was taken three times a day, the absorption of approximately 25% of the food fetch is blocked.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Two double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trials to adults with a BMI of 28 kg / m2 provides the efficacy of 60 mg orlistat, which was taken three times daily in combination with a hypokaline, fetal feeding nutrition.</seg>
<seg id="2538">The primary parameter, the change of body weight compared to the output value (at the time of Randomization), was evaluated as follows: as a proportion of the body weight in the study (Table 1) and as a proportion of participants of study participants, which have lost more than 10% or more than 10% of their initial weight loss (Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2539">Although the weight reduction was observed for 12 months in both studies, the biggest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The average change in the total cholesterin was 60 mg -2.4% (output value 5,20 mmol / l) and with placebo + 2.8% (output value 5,26 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2541">The average change of LDL cholesterol was 60 mg -3.5% (output value 3.30 mmol / l) and with placebo + 3.8% (output value 3.41 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2542">In the waist circumference, the average change of -4.5 cm with orlistat 60 mg (output value of 103,7 cm) and with placebo -3.6 cm (output value is 103,5 cm).</seg>
<seg id="2543">Plasma centriculations of non-metallized orlistat were not measurable 8 hours after the oral application of 360 mg orlistat (&lt; 5 ng / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2544">7 In general, with therapeutic doses not metallized orlistat, plasma could only be sporadic and at extremely low concentrations (&lt; 10 ng / ml, or 0,02 µl) and without signs of cumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2545">In a study of obese patients with minimal resortive dose, two main metabolized dose could be identified, namely M1 (in position 4 hydrolysized Lactonring) and M3 (M1 after graduation of the N-Formyl-Leucine group), which demonstrated almost 42% of the total plasma concentration.</seg>

<seg id="2608">Aloxi is used for chemotherapies, the strong trigger for nausea and vomiting (like Cisplatin), as well as chemotherapy; the excessive trigger for nausea and vomiting are (like cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin or carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The effectiveness of Aloxi can be increased by the additional gift of a corticosteroids (a drug that can be used as antiemetics).</seg>
<seg id="2610">For patients under 18 years of age it is not recommended to provide enough information about the effects in this age group.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the substance prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamin (5HT, also known as serotonin) to prevent the receptors in the bowel.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Aloxi was examined in three main studies of 1 842 adult, chemotherapies received strong or moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">For chemotherapies, the strong trigger for nausea and vomiting are, 59% of patients treated with Aloxi were no vomiting (132 by 223), compared with 57% of patients treated with Ondansetron (126 of 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">At Chemotherapies, the moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting are, 81% of patients treated with Aloxi were no vomiting (153 from 189), compared with 69% of patients treated with Ondansetron (127 from 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In a comparison with Dolasetron these values were 63% for alxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 from 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">In March 2005, the European Commission adopted the company in Helsinki Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd. a permit for the transport of Aloxi within the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indexed: for prevention of acute nausea and vomiting with severe chemotherapy because of cancer illness and prevention of nausea and vomiting with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy due to cancer illness.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The effectiveness of Aloxi to prevention of nausea and vomiting, induced by a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy can be enhanced by adding a Corticosteroids due to chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since Palonosetron can prolong the colon-assure, patients should be monitored with amnesty fruit ipation or signs of a subacrosome Ileus after injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">As with other 5HT3 antagonists, however, caution is advisable for the same gift of Palonosetron with medicines that extend the QT interval or in patients with which the Qt- interval is extended or those tend to increase.</seg>
<seg id="2621">Besides a further chemotherapeutic gift Aloxi is to be used in the days following chemotherapy or for the treatment of nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In pre-clinical studies, Palonosetron not tumbled against tumors (Cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cytarabin, doxorubicin and Mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical study, there was no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between a unique intravenous dose of Palonosetron and a steady-static concentration of a CYP2D6 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In a population based pharmacokinetic analysis showed that the simultaneous gift of CYP2D6 Inhibitors (amethyline, coxetine, coxetine, coxetine, knitine, knonavir, Sertrine and terbinafin) had no significant impact on the Clearance of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experiences on the application of Palonosetron in human pregnancies not occur, so Palonosetron should not be applied in pregnant women unless it is considered necessary by the treatable doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2626">Clinical trials were the most common in a dose of 250 micrograms (a total of 633 patients) which were at least possibly associated with Aloxi in connection, headaches (9%) and fruit ipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10.000) of hypersensitivity reactions and reactions on the Board of Performance (burning, curing, discomfort and pain) were reported in post-marketing experience.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dose there were similar frequencies of adverse events such as in the other lectic groups; there were no dose of action to observe.</seg>
<seg id="2629">There were no dialysis studies carried out due to the large distribution volume, however, a dialysis is probably no effective therapy with an aloe superdose.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double blindness studies were received in total of 1.132 patients who received a moderate-etogenic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 of doxorubicin and 250 mg / m2 doxorubicin and 250 mg / m2 doxorubicin (half-time 7.3 hours), given to Day 1 without dexamethasone intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomised double-blind study, a total of 667 patients who received a strongly-etogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 of cyclophosphamide and dacarbazine as well as 250 or 750 microgram palonosetron received patients who received 32 mg ondansetron, which were given to Day 1 intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of studies with moderate chemotherapy and the study with strongly-etogenic chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical studies, chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) were similar to the effects of Palonosetron on blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters, including the corresponding effects of Ondansetron and Dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">According to the findings of clinical investigations, Palonosetron possesses the ability to block the Ionencanals involved in ventricular De- and Repolarisation and to extend the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study involved in 221 healthy subjects was the assessment of the ECG-effects of I.v. administered in single doses of 0.25, 0,75 and 2,25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption after intravenous gift follows an initial decrease of Plasmaientations a slow elimination from the body with an average terminale half-time of about 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally in the entire dose of dose of 0.3- 90 μ g / kg with butaries and cancer patient dosisproportional.</seg>
<seg id="2638">According to the intravenous gift of Palonosetron 0,25 mg every second day for a total of 3 cans, the mean medium (± SD) increase in Palonosetron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34%.</seg>
<seg id="2639">From pharmacokinetic simulations that once more than one-day intravenous gift received from 0.25 mg palonosetron on 3 consecutive days, total exports (AUC0- ∞) was comparable with the one-time intravenous administration of 0,75 mg, however, the Cmax after one-time ratio was 0.75 mg higher.</seg>
<seg id="2640">Approximately 40% are eliminated about the kidneys, and another 50% are converted into two primary metabolites, compared to Palonosetron on less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro studies for metabolic processes have shown that CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 have been involved in the metabolism of the palabolism of the palabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After a intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron, about 80% of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine, ponosetron as unaltered drug made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a unique intravenous bolt / inject, the total body of 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal Clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">While patients with severe liver function, the terminal elimination cycle time and the average systemic exposure to Palonosetron is increased, however, a reduction of the dose is not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In pre-clinical studies effects were observed only after expositions that are considered sufficient over the maximum human therapeutic exposure, which indicates a low relevance to clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 From pre-clinical studies, indications that Palonosetron can only block in very high concentrations of ion channels that are involved in the ventricular De- and Repolarization.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses Palonosetron (each dose corresponded to about 30 times of therapeutic exposure to humans), which were given daily over two years, led to an increased frequency of liver tumors, endocrine neoplasma (in thyroid, pituitary, pancreas, side nierenmark) and skin tumors in rats, but not mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not fully known, but because of the widely used doses and since Aloxi is determined for unique application, the relevance of these results is very low in humans.</seg>

<seg id="2669">In addition, concern was clearly expressed that data on the stability of the active ingredient and the drug may not suffice.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of patients with Hepatitis C demonstrated on treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A, was similar in clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After setting the treatment with Alpheon, the disease withstands for more patients than at the reference drug; moreover, Alpheon had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">In addition, the test developed in the study was to investigate how far the medication was immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug), not adequately validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used for the treatment of Impetigo (one with crustenosis) and small inunidentified infirmities (Rissing or swisdoms), diced and sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Allogo should not be used to treat infections that have been demonstrably or presumably caused by methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because Alargo may not affect this kind of infections.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Allogo can be applied in patients from the age of nine months, but in patients under 18 years the skin surface should not exceed 2% of the body surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not respond to treatment for two to three days, the physician should investigate the patient and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial rift (the parts of bacteria, in which proteins are produced) and reduces the growth of bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">Main indices of efficacy was in all five studies of the patients whose infection was cancelled after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52,1%) of 71 patients were treated under placebo for the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected area-dogs, Allogo and Cefalexin showed similar response: when the results were taken apart from both clinical studies, about 90% of patients were enrolled in both groups of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In these two studies, however, that altargo was detected in the treatment of abscesses (sincerated cavities in body tissue) or of infections that have been demonstrably or presumably caused by MRSA.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with Altargo (which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is a irritation to the contractor.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The conclusion that the benefits of human medicines (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the benefits of altargo in the short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections has to prevail against the risks: • Impetigo, • infected small lazy, drafts or sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007 the European Commission granted the company Glaxo Group Ltd., a permit for the traffic of Altargo in the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients who have no improvement within two to three days should be examined once more and an alternative therapy is considered to be considered (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In case of lowering or severe local irritation by the application of Retapamulin Saline the treatment is canceled, the ointment carefully wiped out and an appropriate alternative therapy of infection are started.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin is not used to treat infections in which MRSA is known as pathogen or suspects (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical studies, secondary wounds caused the effectiveness of retapamulin in patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).</seg>
<seg id="2689">Alternative therapy is to be considered, if a 2- or 3-day treatment is no improvement or deterioration of the infected place.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The impact of simultaneous use of retapamulin and other topical means on the same skin surface is not studied and the simultaneous application of other topical drugs is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to the low plasma centriculations caused by people after topical use, a clinically relevant inhibition is not expected to be expected in vivo (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After the simultaneous gift of 2 times daily 200 mg ketoconazole the average Retapamulin AUC (0-24) and Cmax after topical application of 1% Retapamulin saline increased on a reduced skin of healthy adult men by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the small systemic exposure after topical application in patients, dosisizations are not kept for necessary when topical retapamulin is applied during a systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a Reproductive function of oral intoxicity and are inadequate in terms of a statement on the birth and the federal state / postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin saline should be used during pregnancy, when a topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indexed and the application of Retapamulin is the gift of a systemic antibiotic.</seg>
<seg id="2696">By decision whether the breastfeeding continued / terminated or terminated with Altargo is concluded between the benefit of a halt for the infant and the benefit of the Allogo therapy for the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical studies of 2150 patients with superficial skin infections that Altargo have been applied, the most commonly reported side effects of Irritation, which affects approximately 1% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Mode of action Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivatives of pidromutiline, a substance that is isolated from fermentation from Clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly pleurotus passeckerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The mode of action of retapamulin is based on the selective inhibiting of the bacterial protein synthesis due to a specific binding point of the 50s subunit of the bacterial Ribosom, which differs from the ties of other ribosomal internal substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicate that the bonds of ribosomal protein L3 is involved in the region of ribosomal P-binding and the Peptide transfer centre.</seg>
<seg id="2701">By binding to this binding point pamromutiline the peptide transfer, partially P-binding interactions and prevent the normal education of active 50s ribosom subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">If the local prevalence of resistance to the use of retapamulin at least some infectious forms appear to be justified by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in the in-vitro activity of retapamulin towards S.aureus, regardless of whether the isolate were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In the case of non-responsive to the treatment of S.aureus, the presence of tribes was to be considered with additional viral factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin).</seg>
<seg id="2705">Absorption In a study with healthy adult, 1% Retapamulin Salbe was applied daily under occlusion and reduced skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Of 516 patients (adults and children), 1% Retapamulin Saline twice daily for 5 days to the topical treatment of secondary infected wounds, individual plasma samples were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">The sampling was performed on the days 3 or 4 in adult patients, before mediation and the children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systematic intake in humans after topical application of 1% saline has been reduced to 200 cm2 (Cmax = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) 660 times lower than the retapamulin IC50 for the PGP inhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism The Metabolism in vitro oxidative metabolism of retapamulin in human liver microsomes was primarily taught by CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies for oral toxicity in rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg), which were conducted over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid changes.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In-vitro examination on gene mutation and / or chromosomal effects in the mouse-lymphoma test or in cultures of human periphic blood lymphocytes and in rats-microkernels for in-vivo study chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">There was neither male nor female rats at oral dosages of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, whereby a maximum of 5 times higher exposure was achieved as the most appreciated exposure of humans (topical application on 200 cm2).</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used to protect hepatitis A and Hepatitis B (diseases, which affects the liver) in children aged between one and 15 years, which are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambirix is applied in the scope of a two-doses existing vaccine, whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after administration of the second dose.</seg>
<seg id="2725">This is why Ambirix can only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during immunisation and ensures that it is possible to end up existing vaccination with two doses.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If an ischemia is desired for hepatitis A or B, Ambirix can be given or another Hepatitis B or B vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines contribute to the immune system (the natural defense of the body), "as it can fight against a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">After a child has received the vaccine, the immune system recognises viruses and surface antigens as "alien" and produces antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same components such as the vaccine vaccrix adults and the vaccine vaccrix kids since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used to protect the same diseases, but Twinrix adults and Twinrix children are administered over three doses of existing vaccum.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix supports identical ingredients, some of the data, which support the application of Twinrix Adult, is also used as proof for the application of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indikator for the efficacy was the proportion of vaccinated children who had developed a month after the last injection a protective antibody concentration.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study with 208 children, the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six-month and a 12-month distance between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambirix resulted in between 98 and 100% of vaccinated children a month after the last injection for the development of protecting anti-hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of the protrix was similar to a six-month distance between the injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of Ambirix (observed at more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses) are headache, appetite deficiency, pain at the injection, redness, matchness (fatigue) and irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix must not be used in patients who react sensitively (allergic) to the active ingredients, one of the other components or Neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">In August 2002, the European Commission informed the company GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals s.a. for authorization for the transport of Ambirix in the entire</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standardization board with Ambirix consists of two vaccines, whereby the first dose is administered at the time of choice and the second dose between six and twelve months after the first dose is administered.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a collection is desired for hepatitis A and hepatitis B, vaccines can be vaccinated with appropriate vaccines or combined vaccination.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis B virus (anti-HBsAg) antibody and anti-hepatitis B virus (anti-HBsAg) antibody and anti-hepatitis B virus (anti-HAV) antibody values are in the same size as after vaccination with the relevant monovalants vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not fully assured whether immune competent individuals who have addressed to a hepatitis-A- vaccination, since they may be protected as protection in no longer detectable antibodies may be protected by immune memory.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As for all injectionate substances, for the rare cases of anaphylactic reaction after the gift of the vaccine, appropriate options of medical treatment and supervision may always be available immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a fast protection against hepatitis B is required, the standardization was recommended with combination of combine hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In case of hematalysis patients and persons with disturbances of the immune system, there is no sufficient anti-HAV- and anti-hbs antibody values, so the gift of other vaccines may be required in these cases.</seg>
<seg id="2746">As an intradermal injection or intramuscular administration could lead to an optimum impairment, these injections should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">In these cases, Ambirix can be injected, however, to injected subcutaneous amounts due to intramuscular injection of bleeding in these cases.</seg>
<seg id="2748">If Ambirix was given in the second year of a separate injection, simultaneously with a combined diphthie-, tetanophilus influenza type b vaccine (DTPA-IPV / HIB) or with a combined mum- mumps-vaccine vaccine, the immune response to all antigens was sufficient (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">In patients under immunosursive therapy or in patients with immunodeficiency, there must be no adequate immune response.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study conducted with 3 vaccination of these formulation in adults, the frequency of pain, redness, swelling, gastroenteritis, headaches and fever comparable to the incidence that was observed in former Thiomeric and preservative vaccination formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical studies, 2029 vaccines were administered to a total of 1027 vaccines at the age of 1 to and including 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study involving 300 participants in the age of 12 up to and including 15 years, the incompatibility of Ambirix was compared with the 3-doses combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2753">Only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and maturities on a calculation basis per vaccination Ambirix, but not on a calculation basis per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the gift of Ambirix in 50.7% of subjects, compared to 39.1% in the subjects following the gift of a dose of 3 doses to combination.</seg>
<seg id="2755">After the complete vaccination cycle, 66.4% of the subjects who had given Ambirix were given, over pain, versus 63.8% were vaccinated with the 3-dose combinations.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the frequency of Matuity was comparable to pro-band (i.e. about the entire vaccination cycle at 39,6% of subjects that were given Ambirix, compared to 36.2% during the subjects that received 3 doses of combination.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The incidence of impregnated pain and matziness was minor and comparable to which the combination of the combination of combination with the 3-doses vaccine was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study of 1 to 11-year-old vaccinations, the presence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambirixgroup was comparable to that with the 3-doses combination inactive hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2759">The 6- until 11- year-old, however, after vaccination with Ambirix a common occurrence of pain (at the injection site) per dose, not per proband, was reported.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The proportion of vaccines, which reported about severe side effects during the 2-doses vaccination with Ambirix or during the 3-doses of hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B virus and 10 µg of recombinant hepatitis B virus infection was statistically not different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials that were carried out in vaccines at the age of 1 to and including 15 years, the fusion ratios for anti-HAV 99.1% were a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, a month 6 administered dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The fusion rates for anti-hbs were 74.2% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, 6 administered dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study that was carried out at 12- to including 15 year olds, 142 two doses Ambirix and 147 were given the standard combinant with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">The 289 Persons whose immunogenicity was extendable (SP in the table below) were significantly higher compared to hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 according to the gift of the 3-dose-vaccines higher than with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immune response, which were achieved in a clinical comparative study at 1- and 11-year-olds, reached a month after completion of the full vaccines (i.e. in month 7), listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies, vaccines were either formed with Ambirix or a 3-doses vaccschema with a combination of 360 ELISA units formalinactive hepatitis-A virus and 10µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In persons, which were aged between 12 and 15 years old, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-hbs antibodies could be detected at least 24 months after immunization with Ambirix in the 0-6-month vaccination.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immune response in this study was comparable to both antigens, comparable to vaccination of 3 doses, consisting of 360 ELISA units formalininactivated hepatatitis- A-virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical study at 12- to including 15 year olds, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-hbs antibodies could be demonstrated 24 months after immunization in 0-6 months vaccschema comparable to that in 0-12 months vaccination.</seg>
<seg id="2770">If the first dose Ambirix was given in the second year of life using a combined diphthie-, tetanus, azellular protussis-, inactivated poliomyelitis- and 8 Haemophilus influenza vaccines was administered, the immune response to all antigens was sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical trial, which was carried out with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults, showed the current formulation similar to Seroprotections- and serokonic rates as for former formulation.</seg>

<seg id="2779">Like all vaccines, Ambirix can not completely protect the infection with hepatitis-hepatitis or hepatitis B virus, even if the complete vaccines was completed with 2 doses.</seg>
<seg id="2780">If you / your child are infected with hepatitis-hepatitis or hepatitis B virus (although you feel / her child may not feel uncomfortable or sick at the point of time), a vaccine may not prevent a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2781">Protection against other infections that harm liver or symptoms which are similar to those of hepatitis-hepatitis or hepatitis B infection can not be conveyed.</seg>

<seg id="2785">When a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination, the doctor will advise you / your child from a vaccination with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Instead, he / your child will recommend 3 injections of a combined hepatitis-B virus and hepatitis B vaccine per vaccine dose (360 ELISA units of a formal inactive hepatitis B virus and 10 micrograms of a recombinant hepatitis B surface coating).</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second vaccination of this vaccine with reduced amount of effective components is usually given a month after the first dose and should give you a vaccination protection before end of the vaccination series.</seg>
<seg id="2788">Sometimes, Ambirix will suffer from heavy blood clots suffering from the skin and not injected into the muscle. if you / your child are weakened in your own body or treatment in your own body, or if you / your child may undergo a hematalysis.</seg>
<seg id="2789">Ambirix can be given in these cases, but the immune response of these persons on the vaccine cannot be sufficient, so that a blood test may be necessary to see how strongly the reaction to the vaccine is.</seg>
<seg id="2790">21 Say to your doctor if you are taking / receiving your child further medicines (including those who have been vaccinated without prescription) or if you have received / or immunoglobulins (antibodies) has been given / or it is planned in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2791">However, it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is not protected against either one or both hepatitis A and B virus.</seg>
<seg id="2792">If another vaccine is given at the same time with Ambirix, separate places should be vaccinated in separate places and as many as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2793">If Ambirix is to be given at the same time or after an injection of immunoglobulins, it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine is still sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2794">Usually, Ambirix will not be given to pregnant or lactating women unless it is urgent that they are vaccinated against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B.</seg>

<seg id="2805">Based on the data, which has become known since the issuance of the first approval for the traffic authority, CHMP resigned the benefit of the benefit-risk ratio for Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2806">However, since Ambirix was only in one member state (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available security data for this medicine is limited to the low patient value.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammonium can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with incomplete Enzymatic or hyperammonium encephalopathy (brain damage due to high ammoniacconcentrations) in prehistory.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonium - divided into several individual components with meals - swallowed by the food mixed or via a gastrostomichives (through the stomach-ceiling in the stomach of leading hose) or a nose sonic (by the nose into the stomach of leading hose).</seg>
<seg id="2809">It was not a comparative study, since ammonium does not have to be compared to other treatment or placebo (a placebo, i.e. without active ingredient).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ammonium can also cause loss of appetite, loss of acid in blood, depression, irritability, headache, oops, vomiting, nausea, clogging, nausea, failure, skin rash or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">At the end, the Committee on Humanities (CHMP) concluded that ammonium is effectively prevented in patients with the urea cycle of high ammoniac disease.</seg>
<seg id="2812">Ammonium was approved under "exceptional circumstances" because of the condition of the disease at the time of admission only limited information on this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indicated in all patients with which a complete encymatic organ has already manifested in the newborage (within the first 28 life days).</seg>

<seg id="2832">These symptoms come with the accumulation of phenylacetat, which showed a doscope-limiting neurotoxicity at an intravenous administration of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetat is an metabolized active compound containing glutamine to phenylacetylene glutamine, which is excreted through the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Pestilometrically is seen in phenylacetylglutamine (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine therefore is therefore as an alternative carrier for excretion of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with disturbances of the urea cycle can be assumed that for each gram, sodium phenylbutystock can be produced between 0,12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylene glutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is of importance that the diagnosis is early and the treatment is immediately begun to improve survival and clinical results.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the appearance of the first symptoms in the newborns was almost always infectious - and the disease himself led to death with peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids, or with their nitrogen-free analogue in the first year of life.</seg>
<seg id="2838">Due to hematalysis, the use of alternative ways of nitrogen waste (sodium polyphenylbutyrate, sodium benzoate and possibly substitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of newborns at postpartal (however within the first month of life) to increase diagnosed diseases to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed during pregnancy, the survival rate was 100%, but even in these patients the survival rate was with many intellectual disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a late form of the disease (including female patients with the heterozygous form of the Orniintranscarzoylase-deficiency), which were treated from hyperammonium encephalopathy and subsequently treated with sodium phenylbutyrat and a proteined diet, the survival rate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Existing Neurological deficits are hardly reversible and in some patients, a further deterioration of the neurological condition can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylbutyrat is oxidized to phenylacetat, which is conjugated in liver and kidney, with phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites in plasma and urine were determined according to the gift of a single dose of 5 g sodium polyphenylbutystock in patients with disturbances of the urea cycle, hemogglobosis, and with liver cirrhosis as well as repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day (not controlled trials).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behaviour of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites were also investigated for intravenous gift of sodium phenylbutyrat (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetat.</seg>

<seg id="2849">According to the results of Micronucleus testing, Soviphenylbutyrat had been treated with toxic and non-toxic doses (examination 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS Granules is taken either orally (babies and children who can swallow not any tablets or patients with swallowing disorders) or a gastrostomifier or a nasal sonic.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to previous clinical experiences, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as for growing and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (in particular branched-chain amino acids), carnitine and serum proteins should be kept within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">In patients who suffer an early manifested lack of carbamylphosphate synthetic or orniintranscarbamboo, the substitution of citruline or arginine is required at a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS Granules contains 124 mg (5,4 mmol) sodium per gram sodium phenylbutyrat, corresponding to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrat, equivalent to the maximum daily dose.</seg>

<seg id="2860">After an oral individual dose of 5 g of sodium phenylbutyrat in granulatform, 15 minutes after intake of the plasma concentration of phenylbutyrat were noted.</seg>
<seg id="2861">During the duration of durability, the patient can use the finished product for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not over 25 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2862">In this case the small measuring scoop 0.95 g, the average measuring scoop of 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.6 g sodium phenylbutyrat.</seg>
<seg id="2863">If a patient has to obtain the medicine over a probe, AMMONAPS can also be dissolved in water before use (the solubility of sodium phenylbutyrate is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">In patients with these rare diseases, certain liver enzymes are missing, so that they accumulate the nitrogen of waste in the body after consumption of protein in the body.</seg>
<seg id="2865">If lab tests are performed, you must tell the doctor that you are taking AMMONAPS, since sodium phenylbutyrat can influence the results of certain laboratory studies.</seg>

<seg id="2879">Angiox will be used to treat patients with acute coronarsis "(ACS, reduced blood supply to the heart), for example at instabiler Angina (a form of pain in the chest with different strength) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) without" STRUTHING "(an anomination value at electrocardiogram or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If Angiox is used to prevent blood clots in patients who will undergo a PCI, a higher dose may be administered and the infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can help patients with angina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS, with the effect of angiox in sole gift or in connection with a glycoprotein-IIb / IIIA inhibitor (GPI, another medicine to prevent blood clots) with a conventional combination treatment with Heparin (another antibody drug) and a GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">During the PCI the patient was often a stent (a short tube that remains in the artery to prevent a lock), and they also received other medicines to prevent blood clots, such as Abciximab and Aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">In the treatment of ACS was Angiox - with or without a gift of GPI - in preventing new events (deaths, heart attacks or precascularization) after 30 days or a year as effective as normal treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients who underwent a PCI, Angiox was just as effective as Heparin, except for heavy bleeding in which it was significantly more effective than Heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox may not be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) against bivalirudine, other deudine or other components.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It may not be applied to patients who recently had a bleeding, as well as people with strong high blood pressure or serious kidney problems or a heart infection.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee on Humaninary Medicine (CHMP) concluded that Angiox is a acceptable replacement for Heparin during a PCI, while a PCI is an acceptable replacement for Heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission granted the Company The Medicines Company UK Ltd with permission to transport Angiox throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronarsyndromes (instabile angina / non-ST) infarction (IA / NSTEMI) or an early intervention is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended initial dose of angiox in patients with ACS is an intravenous bolt of 0.1 mg / kg, followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If a PCI is carried out in another sequence, an additional Bolus of 0.5 mg / kg should be increased and the infusion for the duration of the intervention should be increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2893">According to the PCI, after clinical requirements, the reduced infusion dose of 0,25 mg / kg / h can be resumed for 4 to 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Immediately before the procedure, a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be administered, followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dosage of angiox in patients with a PCI is made up of an initial intravenous infusion of 0,75 mg / kg body weight and a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Safety and effectiveness of a single Bolus gift by Angiox has not been examined and is not recommended if a short PCI procedure is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value is shortened to under 225 seconds, this value should be shortened by 0.3 mg / kg / bodyweight (ACT after 5 minutes).</seg>
<seg id="2898">To reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values, the reconstituted and diluted medicine should be carefully mixed and administered intravenously before applying to the application.</seg>
<seg id="2899">Once the ACT value is more than 225 seconds, another monitoring is no longer required, provided that the 1.75 mg / kg Infusion dose is administered correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with moderate-severe kidney function (GFR 30-59 ml / min), which is subjected to a PCI (whether with Bivalirudine is treated against ACS or not), a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT-value is less than 225 seconds, a second type of bolt of 0.3 mg / kg is enough to check the ACT 5 minutes once again after the second bolt.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with moderate kidney damage, which was included in the phase III- PCI study (Replace-2), which was included, the ACT value was 5 minutes after the gift of the Bivalirudin Bolus without dosissistency on average (366 ± 89 seconds).</seg>
<seg id="2903">3 For patients with severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and also with dialysis patients Angiox is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2904">The treatment with Angiox can be initiated within 30 minutes after the termination of the intravenous Heparin or 8 hours after the termination of the subcutaneous gift of low-molecular Heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2905">• known hypersensitivity to the active substance or other components or against herudine • active bleeding and / or irreversible hypertonia. • severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and dialysis patients</seg>
<seg id="2906">Patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding, especially when bivalirudine is administered in combination with another anticoagulant (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even if PCI-patient occur under bivalirudine most bleedings on arterial puncture, patients can undergo a percutaneous Koronarintervention (PCI), while the treatment is generally occurring in hemorrhages.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients receiving warfarin and treated with Bivalirudine, a monitoring of the INR value (International normalised debt recovery) should be considered to ensure that the level of treatment with Bivalirudine was once again achieved before the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Starting from the knowledge about the mechanisms of action of antioagulants (Heparin, warfarin, thrombolytics or platelbozytendencies) can assume that these compounds increase blood risk.</seg>

<seg id="2921">The following side effects, which are not listed above, were reported according to comprehensive application in practice and are classified according to system organs in table 6.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In case of an overdose the treatment with Bivalirudine is immediately broken down and the patient narroig with regard to signs of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains Bivalirudine, a direct and specific Thrombinwaror, which binds both in the catalytic centre as well as on the Animbin region of Thrombin, regardless of whether the Thrombin is bound in the liquid phase or on Gerinnsel.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The binding of Bivalirudin on Thrombin, and thus its effect, is reversible, because Thrombin considers the binding of Bivalirudin-Arg3-Pro4, making the function of the active centre of Thrombin regenerates.</seg>

<seg id="2971">The main indikator for the effectiveness was the change of concentration of the substance glycoiled hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes, a reduction of 0.014% (from 7,60% to 7.46%) compared to a decrease of 0.14% at insulin-lisper was noted after six months.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, the decrease in the HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra compared to 0.30% with human normal levels.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra can not be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) against insulin or one of the other components, or in patients who are already suffering from hypoglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra might need to be adjusted, if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood glucose level.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004 the European Commission adopted the company Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH, authorization for the transport of Apidra in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra is used as a subcutaneous injection either in the field of abdominal wall, thigh or to subcutaneous injector by continuous infusion in the field of abdominal cavity.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to the reduced glucose consumption and reduced insulin delivery, the insulin needs in patients with a limitation of liver function may be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change of action strength, the brand (Her- Steller), insulin type (normal, NPH, zinc delayed, etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the manufacturing method can draw a change of insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 An inadequate dosage or termination of treatment, especially in patients with an insulable diabetes, may lead to hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoaziz; these conditions are potentially endangered.</seg>
<seg id="2981">Conversion of a patient to another insulin type or an insulin treatment should be conducted under strict medical supervision and can make a change of dosage necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The timing of a hypoglycaemia depends on the action profile of the used insulin and can therefore change at the changeover of the treatment schemas.</seg>
<seg id="2983">To the substances that increase blood sugar levels and intensify the inclination to hypoglynics, angiotenin-converting enzyme (ACE) -Hemmer, pentoxifylline, propoxyphics, lyphylates, calizylates and sulfonamide antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, under the effect of sympatholytics such as Betablockers, Clonidin, Guanethidin and spare pin the symptoms of repinacea contradiction are weakened or missing.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Experimental studies on reproduction of reproduction showed no difference between insu- linglulisin and humanities regarding pregnancy, the embryonic / fetal development, the birth or the postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insulin is overtaking into human milk, but in general, insulin is not absorbed in either native milk, nor is it absorbs after oral application.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Below are those of clinical trials known to those unwanted drug conditions (very frequently: ≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; often: ≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10.000, &lt; 1 / 100; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10.000; very rare: (frequency based on the baits data is not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold-welding, cool and pale skin, fatigue, nervousness or tremor, anxiety, unusual fatigue or weakness, confusion, concentration problems, benommentionality, nausea, headache, nausea and palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophy is missed to continuously change the injection site within the injection area, a lipoystrophy can occur at the injection site.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglynics with consciousness-lessness can be given by a intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of Glukagon (0.5 to 1 mg), which is given by a correspondingly trained person or by a doctor treating glucose by a physician.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After a glucose injection, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the urine cause for severe hypoglycemia and to avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose intake (especially through skeletal musculature and fat) and the inhibition of glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in subcutaneous Ga- be effected by insulin treatment and the active duration is shorter than at hu- manem normal levels.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study involving 18 male individuals aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes, insulin-relevant dispensing area from 0.075 to 0.15 E / kg showed a proportional increase of the gluing effect, and with 0.3 E / kg or more a proportional increase of the gluing effect, precisely like humanities.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin-lulisin has a double so fast active ingredient like normal humanities and achieves the full visualizescent effect around 2 hours earlier than humanities.</seg>
<seg id="2996">From the data was evident that during an application of insulin-lulisin 2 minutes before meal, a comparable postpranal glycemic control is reached, as with human normal levels, which will be given 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">When insulin was harvested 2 minutes before the meal, a better postpranal control was given as with human normal levels, which was given 2 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If insulin is turned into 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal, a similar glycemic control is given as with human normal levels, which is given 2 Mi- Nes before the meal (see Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin treatment in gift 2 minutes before the beginning of the meal was given in comparison to human normal levels, 30 minutes (NORMAL - 30 min) before the beginning of the meal was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before a meal (Figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin treatment in gift 15 minutes (GLULISIN: after the beginning of the meal, compared to human norms, which was given 2 minutes before the beginning of the meal (Figure 1C) before the beginning of the meal.</seg>
