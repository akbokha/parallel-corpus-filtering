improved database with much more metadata , such as &amp; eg ; over the camera or the lens can be searched .
like all &amp; k@@ kers , programs is also &amp; digi@@ ous ; an open source project . that means , it is dependent on the support of the end . you should therefore report problems and improvement options .
&amp; digi@@ came ; try to make the problem of problems or improvements as easily as possible for them . wherever you use these links , your web browser will open a page in the error report system . all required information is listed here . please follow the instructions to send your message .
&amp; digi@@ came ; is a project supported by a community . that means that the user and developer help each other . if you are interested in other users of &amp; digi@@ ous ; ask here and hope to ask questions other users . in this mailing list , you should be English , therefore , you should be powerful .
you may also visit the digi@@ plug ; homepage visit News about shared versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ came ; to learn .
the best start to get to &amp; digi@@ came ; registration in the developer mailing list . instructions for sign in the developer mailing list by &amp; digi@@ came ; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you are running &amp; digi@@ ous ; for the first time you will be asked where you want to save your pictures and your database . simply enter a local , remote or remote folder . simply type sc@@ y@@ out names or click the folder icon to select a folder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the second field you have to specify a local folder on your computer . here the data ab@@ n@@ k is stored . this path remains the same for all image folders .
later you can add as many folders as you want . &amp; digi@@ came ; you can additionally set up as an alkal@@ ine library .
if you already have a picture collection on your hard disk , you can specify the top folder , the picture contains , as the base folder . &amp; digi@@ came ; look at each sub@@ folder as an album . no picture is changed . during the search for the folder , you get a progress indicator like this :
&amp; digi@@ came ; dur@@ st recur@@ sively add the libr@@ arian path in its depth . you can &apos;t leave sub @-@ folders , unless it is placed in cover@@ t folder . you can insert an extraordinary &amp; digi@@ ous folder ; you can add a point in front of the name of the sub@@ folder .
if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ list will have no photos as symbols . you can change it by using any photos from the album and it will then be used as an album symbol . more details will be found in the albums section .
once you have configured the base folder , you can set up in &amp; digi@@ . your digital camera was set up . afterwards , you should learn how to use My Albums and My Vari@@ ables to manage your photos in the albums .
raw file support : if you &apos;re using the raw mode of your camera , you may also handle it . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the menu help Roh@@ k@@ amer@@ a@@ assist .
how to set up and work with raw files is described in the sections of Ro@@ h Dec@@ oder@@ m and Ro@@ h @-@ workflow .
an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera body will be provided , so that you can connect with your digital camera and get your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ ous , with the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course every medium and every card reader is supported by your operating system , with &amp; digi@@ plug ; working together .
modern digital cameras are registered with the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; Memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IEEE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transmission . the camera will also be used as a USB mass storage device . the camera also appears as a USB transfer protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ atives . older cameras use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&amp; digi@@ ous ; uses the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 to communicate with digital cameras , which supports a constantly increasing number of over 800 cameras , which has a constantly increasing number of over 800 cameras , which has been developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows transmission of digital cameras to host cameras and other peripher@@ als without the need additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the calcul@@ ator . since photos in general are large files and transm@@ is@@ sions over the serial port is out@@ dated . &amp; digi@@ came ; supports these cameras and transfer the transmission of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link .
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 has to be created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support . the EX@@ IF support is required from some lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 @-@ camera operators to read the thumb@@ nails . if the EX@@ IF support does not exist in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you may possibly be able to make thumb@@ nails or the production could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things at &amp; digi@@ came ; is how easy to extend his functionality by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image plug @-@ ins interface Project ( Manual ) is a joint mod@@ ulation structure for &amp; digi@@ came ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the goal is to provide the modules to all graphical programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate images in almost any way as it is also a user . their advantage is that it is much simpler , &amp; digi@@ ous ; through writing a small module to add a function as the changes in &amp; digi@@ came ; even perform .
to simpli@@ fy the window , you can either remove the page with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch in full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ trl + Shift + F .
pulling and down images works everywhere : you can place a picture in another part of the Al@@ ben@@ tree , via the horizontal partition line or in another application window . the only limitation is the one image not in keywords , data list or searching .
- a file selection allows you to extract the most common : JPEG , P@@ NG , TIFF , Ro@@ h , movies and audio
the text filter is used only for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view . this way the fil@@ tering is displayed on the fil@@ en@@ ame only if this ind is shown symbo@@ lically . which fields are shown in the dialog of the Al@@ ame Settings .
the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ evol@@ ve quot ; presents a organized view on your photo albums . all photos that have been saved on the hard disk will be sorted according to the names of their collection in the al@@ ben@@ ds or after the date , where the album was first created , sorted . the date can be modified in the properties of the album .

&amp; digi@@ came ; character@@ izes every picture by a long number with a special technique , the hair @-@ algorithm . this allows to compare images by compar@@ ing these signatures ; the less the difference between two pixels , depending on them . this technique is applied in three areas .
similar entries : this is a field where you can drop every picture , in order to be able to find a similar case . by means of a swelling result , the results can be enlarged or reduced by the symbol of in@@ accurate search in the left side@@ bar , then it will open and you can drop it down there .
sk@@ etch : draw a fast sk@@ etch and digi@@ plug ; find the right images . also here can be a swelling value .
this tab is an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . press C@@ trl ; left mouse button to pull out a square . all images within this co @-@ ordin@@ ates are filtered and displayed . this is of course keeping your pictures of ge@@ o data .

&amp; digi@@ came ; presents a light in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . it works with all supported frame formats , also raw files , together .
select one or more images from any view@@ point in the main window and then use C@@ trl @-@ L . the selection will be added to the light table and its windows open . if you are back in &amp; digi@@ plug ; main window , you can quickly open the LEDs with L Extras .
from the thumb@@ nail you can draw the pictures you want to compare , in the left or right area of the window . if you can preview it from the tool@@ bar and perform the different images on one of the pictures , then they will be able to compare these images on the other picture . so you can compare the same area to both pictures .
another mode is better to send out of a picture series . if you want to navigate out of the tool bar , then the two first images will navigate automatically to the comparison list . use the left mouse button in any thumb@@ nail to view it in the right pane . this is simplified by a number of similar images .
of course , normal del@@ e@@ actions work directly from the bulb , like F4 file editing ....
all image information from the right side bar of the main window are available for both thumb@@ nails . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
in the lower end of each area you will find a built @-@ in swi@@ pe function , which you can click on the cross@@ wise arrows . in order to preview the visible range of the picture , you have to preview it and down the picture . in the mode , both pictures will show the same image area .
the zo@@ oming works just as in other views . simply use the zoom kno@@ b under the images or c@@ trl ; mouse wheel to zoom into and beyond . this happens in both pictures when you are in the preview pane .
what is a digital inventory - away from the Mode@@ word ? digital controls are considered every part of the process after the image has been taken , sc@@ anned or digital photos , but most of us do not make this in a systematic and efficient way .
we will provide you with a tool , a plan and practical tips how you can back up your pictures , use , backup , upgrade , group@@ ing , secure , evaluate , upgrade , edit , edit , export and export image files .
&amp; quot ; digital inventory ass@@ umes , inde@@ xed , categ@@ or@@ ized , categ@@ or@@ ized , transformed , conf@@ ected and exported content that have a monetary or cultural value . quot ;
metadata is defined as data via data . metadata is defined according to your definition , information about or a documentation of other data , which are managed by a application or environment .
I do not claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you will need to find a certain photo no longer . if you don &apos;t know how many photos you have , then you will definitely use quick searching and secure archi@@ ving that you can access with other programs , platforms , and formats .
the first thing you can do and know before you want to know something in your system . you need to have any other access to your system . you need to have any other access to your photos , if you want to save them on a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc ; make sure you need to switch to a larger drive .
maybe you will be happy with this structure . you can easily organize articles about your location . if you &apos;ve been here several times the same place . if you have enough photos , then you will use sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; you can then print a folder for pictures you print or publish on a website .
professional photograph@@ ers have different requirements , such as ver@@ sion@@ ing photos , archi@@ ving , work processes , constant supply of images on different topics and a large number of all . within 10 years 95 % archives and 5 % working files will be and you will not want to re@@ organise your structure for this content .
what kinds of files fit together ? separation of file types makes the pile processing easier . separate new from old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derived image .
we also recommend the metadata into the file &apos;s settings page . if you forget that EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data will be written into the file . if you forget , then you can save the metadata from the database in the files by choosing the corresponding item in the menu album .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change what if you want to change ? add a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are the most important ones .
now the real work starts , as you should now select any photograph words , lab@@ s and an evaluation . of course , you can select all images that will need the same attribute . you start the best with the evaluation or the ranking . this makes sense when you can focus on the best photos .
let &apos;s go with keywords , keywords , as you often are called in other programs . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
when you import Catal@@ og@@ ging pictures from another source with embedded windows , then &amp; digi@@ came ; automatically set the tree for you to build the pictures on another . the changed keywords are done on one another . the changed keywords are taken by &amp; digi@@ ous ; updated during it the under@@ trees .
the graphic shows how different metadata changes . this is a very coar@@ se representation because every block of metadata is composed of many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar data are properties of all pictures .
enough of the keywords - the next section refers to labelling or comments , the third important tool for catal@@ og@@ ing your metadata .
most people don &apos;t want to just see your photos just , you want to share them with your friends , your family , other photograph@@ ers and agencies . they are safe to take care of your photos .
have a look at this panoramic view . from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look closer to see some details , people , the place .
and now I say to you this the lan@@ de@@ platz of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ ot ; in the French Nor@@ mans 60 years after the landing . Wow ! one starts to dream , associations , the historical time span is again present , you may even hear the silence . thus , your perception has completely changed this panoramic view .
for others viewing your photos it may be more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to help you understand the key to help you understand what you need to understand what you understand .
it is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to act with in@@ scri@@ bing alone .
with &amp; digi@@ ous ; you can use any other text in an internation@@ alised alpha@@ bet . you can even export it to a selection of pictures at the same time . if you export your pictures in Web @-@ galleries , then these labels will be able to tell your imag@@ inations in the label and / or the title of the web site .
do you remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find in another city without navigation system ? was the earth not a boring planet from Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures the train leaves the spatial presentation now with light speed .
the opportunities to explo@@ it ge@@ ol@@ oc@@ alization are already countless . I &apos;m sure that one day , in the near future , can be able to repeat your journeys by images with ge@@ ographic information . you can also export the photos on the capture site . you can also export the photos on the capture site . you can also export the images to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Flickr &amp; etc .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word game with copyright and den@@ oting the practice the copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on distribution and change of copies . the same fre@@ ed@@ oms also apply in all versions , so also for the work of others .
the following description tells you what information is in the setup page of &amp; digi@@ ous ; as information should be deposited as information :
author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the photographer , for example , to protect the identity of the photographer , then the name of a company or organization is used . after which this value was saved , it should not be changed . this field does not support compos@@ ites or sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ator .
aut@@ ism : linked to the author . this field contains the job title of the photographer . examples of this title can be titles as : employee photographer , freelance photographer , or independent commercial photographer . as this is a note to the author field , this must be completed as well .
publisher ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the vend@@ or field to identify those who offer this photo . if the photographer works for a news agency such as Reuters , or Associated Press , then these organizations can be listed here . if the picture is a storage picture , the group / agency is given the picture here .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although they have no protection against abuse . every one has a little more than basic knowledge in working with calcul@@ ator . for individuals , this is important for the majority of your photos only from low interest . for professionals and hal@@ e professionals , this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is unique in each image . &amp; digi@@ came ; in the near future , a module for stap@@ le processing is available .

of course we don &apos;t talk about CDs that were lost on the street or a fire . these kinds of losses are the same which can also happen to you with traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section it &apos;s about problems with the so @-@ called New Media .
Kro@@ ll On@@ track , the largest data recovery firm in the world , has some interesting statistics which reasons for a data loss .
to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs this must be treated more difficult and you may not buy more than a few years . of course , you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archi@@ ving quality . of course there are offers about gold @-@ coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 this piece can claim a lifetime of 100 years for themselves . if you believe it is in your mess@@ y room .
CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be ille@@ gible , but you can use this risk in which you can use good Dis@@ ks and good recording devices . the best DVD recordings are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write much reliable . it &apos;s about to select the right way .
CDs and DVDs are very sus@@ cep@@ tible to mistakes , even if you just have just written . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for the form@@ atting and the control environment . despite this massive prot@@ ections they are needed by chemical aging , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc ;
for faulty CDs and DVDs , there &apos;s a convenient program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster , but it doesn &apos;t work for Mac@@ s , but it &apos;s not available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read the damaged data of damaged disks , hard drives , flash media , USB drives , etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs seem to store the format war against the HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disc can save 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB . all that was said to CDs and DVDs is also valid for the Blu @-@ ray disc .
burn slowly with a good recording device on high quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ ated format . you should also read the media on a clean , dark dry and protected animals protected site . you don &apos;t forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the latest piece of hardware or software that can read these media .
disk manufacturers keep your statistics for themselves . your manufacturer &apos;s tools include a new disk , but not the data . Google introduces a large field study on the error @-@ mechanisms of hard drives .
shortly , Dis@@ ks keep the most frequent error rate when you are operating at the temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C . in case of lower temperature cases , this error may not determine the immediate failure . these are particularly readers and re@@ iter@@ ation . these are particularly readers and re@@ iter@@ ation . the expected lifetime of life is between 4 and 5 years .
this is only the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also have data loss due to an black@@ out before you have secured the files , but these losses are normally restored without major problems .
while most electric devices do not make up a lot , this can take heavy damage to devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed hardware . these may cause serious damage , hardware age , destroyed mother@@ boards and other defects . thus , protect yourself from the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money .
the most common protection against power peaks is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that is absorbed and the rest is earth@@ ed . it is normally available in the form of a plug bar . remember that not every plug @-@ bar also contains a sur@@ ge protection .
if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , then you should be sure that he ful@@ fil@@ s the UL 14@@ 49 standard . you should also take care of protection against lightning strikes and protects the correctly connected devices .
since an over@@ voltage of each cable can be used to your computer , you should also take care of all peripher@@ als that can be connected to your system . some manufacturers make a phone connection for your modem . others offer connection possibilities for the co@@ axial cable of the cable mode@@ ms and the TV card .
if you have a notebook , then you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially developed for not@@ ebooks , and therefore contain the protection for the modem . thus , you are ideal for travelling .
while an over@@ voltage protection your system protects against smaller variations in power supplies , it will not really help you with a complete failure . even a failure of few seconds can result in loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . therefore , it may be useful to invest in a interrup@@ tible power supply .
in addition to protection from over@@ h@@ ings , these devices can automatically add battery energy . this gives you the possibility to save your data and work on . if you buy a UPS , you should be sure to keep the same quality requirements like an over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the lifetime of the battery and the supplied software is interesting .
remember the potential risk of being exposed to your computing system and increase your safety in terms of energy costs with the costs to avoid this . a high @-@ quality over@@ load protection can be paid for less than &amp; euro ; 40 . this is only a small price difference if you are considering how well your computer is protected . at the end , you should always call all cables before you go to holiday .
the Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the correct configuration you can use this as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to save it as a backup destination for your software . Google Sh@@ ared Storage is another popular offer that you can store any quantity of data .
but compared to the hard drives at home , however , very expensive - 40 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 500 . in addition , you must send the data on compar@@ atively slow internet .
solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images . this is not a bad solution , but there is no general backup solution . it is too slow .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Flickr ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are available on photos . you will not have your pictures available , in case of Flickr dramatically more . for $ 25 per year you will get unlimited memory which should only be checked in reality .
the data backup is very secure from the point of view of data backup . transfer errors are automatically adjusted to the TCP protocol , and in the big companies offer a backup and a stored memory . thus , they are safe .
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the calcul@@ ator . all transfers are sus@@ cep@@ tible to transmission errors . the fil@@ esystem support and b@@ tr@@ fs establish at least the data integrity between operating system and hard disk .
the worst thing is that there is no one to tell you when a transmission error occurred . all these distur@@ ban@@ ces remain un@@ discovered until you stay in your computer . no one seems to have thought about it . no one seems to have thought about it . the Internet with its TCP protocols is a much safer data path than that in your computer .
un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses , as they generate inter@@ ferences within data currents . these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are not affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . in 2010 , you will see thousands of errors per year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ FS from Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who are able to deal with record lack and highly scal@@ able . it is open source , with many patents and is available under one of the GPL licensed license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it is available soon for &amp; Linux ; and Windows is available . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oracle started an initiative with his b@@ tr@@ fs fil@@ esystem . this is still in alpha state . it uses the same prot@@ ections of the z@@ fs and is also available for &amp; Linux ; but it is not part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the data loss in the notebook and 46 % of the workplace systems . in case of not@@ ebooks , the proportion of theft is already 50 % .
data loss because of viruses is less common than most people think . it is currently limited to Microsoft systems , such as theft or re@@ install@@ ments . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; no one has been sigh@@ ted for long .
open source file systems are less vulner@@ able to data loss as proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reis@@ er@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to call the common fil@@ es@@ ystems . you can find a very good English article here .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of trial during a sudden inter@@ ruption during surgery is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file was not completely saved before the problem occurred , it is lost .
viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : wrong , theft and human faul@@ ts are the major causes of data loss .
digital cameras sensors are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings removed from fundamental physical limits . it is meant that while technology continues to develop a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and space characteristic for all types of light sensors are no longer removed from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras go towards the 10 meg@@ api@@ x@@ el@@ s. even though this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the final result is more deteri@@ or@@ ating for compact cameras . even DS@@ LR cameras have a full @-@ format sensor ( 24x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard drive you get responsible today for 100 &amp; euro ; so you don &apos;t think any other data loss for data loss . so your data is often affected by a data loss . so check your data often according to a plan and try to make sure you feel any more dangerous like the new installation of your operating system , the exchange of disks or the size change of hard drives .
suppose you take your securities on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , you hit a flash when the drive was not connected in the moment .
a disaster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget airplane gap : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous enough for your data . they usually concern a whole room or the whole house .
therefore des@@ ks always means a non @-@ local storage . bring your f@@ uses up the stairs up to the neighbor@@ ing house , in your office or something like .
there is another advantage of the physical separation : as above already is a common reason for a data loss despite f@@ use the panic . if you have a backup that is not available immediately , then you can save that one day .
full backup : a full backup of all files that should be secured . it is a snap@@ shot without history and represents a complete copy of a date .
differentiation : a backup of files that have been modified since the last complete backup . creates a complete snap@@ shot of two time points : the complete backup and the last differential .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of files that have been changed since the last backup . you can restore the original status at any time to which one backup is made . this f@@ use comes with a ver@@ sion@@ ing system next to the exception that it is only de@@ get@@ ed and not continuous .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . in contrast to script controlled FTP , or other kinds of file transfer scripts , r@@ sync only the difference of files that have really changed . this happens and if you want to enhance safety about ssh .
backup important pictures directly after you saved them on your computer to a DVD or another optical media .
this approach makes you enough time to detect and restore loss . at the same time , you come to secure , but with &amp; lt ; 130 % of the size of the working files . at the end , you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snap@@ shot for at least one month and a snap@@ shot of each month . every further di@@ lution should be done manually , after which you have made a complete review .
topics : metadata , stored in the image file used IP@@ TC data , retain memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ locate of images and metadata , copy the images to the next generation of media , applications , OS@@ es , virtu@@ alization , visibility , ...
with that valuable pictures can survive the next 40 year , that is approximately the time span in which you are really interested in your childhood or adolesc@@ ence , there are two strategies that should be respected :
as the future is predic@@ table because of your nature is not predic@@ table , you need to review and re@@ assess anything today . unfortunately , there is no other way to ask yourself as a certain vig@@ il@@ ance . every 5 @-@ 8 years you should ask yourself how the current system is backwards . if less you have used in the past , it is easier to assess the questions of the future .
this question should actually be answered using the explanations in this document . use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications .
virtu@@ alization is now available for everyone . so if you have an old system that is important to read your images , keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for a later use .
on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , your memory and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard . stay open to open standards .
scal@@ ability is designed to change a system in its size . this is actually increasing .
let &apos;s assume that you have entered the scal@@ ability with you and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition . at * nix systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and shift it to a new record :
check the d@@ mes@@ g command , if your new record has been recognized by the system , but do not hang them .
&amp; dollar ; dd if = / dev / S@@ DC # source is / dev / S@@ DC / S@@ DC . part@@ ed re@@ size / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; part@@ ed re@@ size / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; resi@@ ze@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of Reis@@ er@@ FS if necessary
open Source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if there is no software to read , then you can create it yourself . this task is easier for year to year .
GIF is a proprietary , patented format that dis@@ appears slowly from the market . therefore , you shouldn &apos;t use it anymore .
P@@ NG has been used as an open source standard to replace the GIF . however , it is no longer necessary to store X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC Metad@@ ata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . P@@ NG can store a lot of administrative information , but not as many as TIFF needs and has a slow compression . we would like to recommend you to store your images .
TIFF has been widely distributed as image format . it manages images in high quality , but it manages images in high quality , but requires very large files . with some cameras you can store your pictures in this format . a problem is that this format has been adapted from many people . there are therefore more than 50 different types , and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG The Digital Neg@@ ative File Format is a license @-@ free and open resource format that has been developed by Adobe Systems . it has been developed because of the need to use the camera power formats . it is already available on the TIFF / EP format and we hope to use the camera values and we hope to use the competitors Canon and Nikon also sometime .
this is possibly one of the reasons why , around 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology ; a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Metad@@ ata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mix of XML and R@@ DF . the file information is stored by extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; saved the XML / R@@ DF .
many photograph@@ ers pull it before an original of your recording , mostly in the raw format , to archive file formats and the image file is required . therefore , it can be linked to the link between the metadata stream and the image file . therefore , you should consider whether you use D@@ NG as container and put it together there .
the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata Initiative is an open organization supporting a wide range of application purposes and business models . the activities of D@@ C@@ MI belongs to the D@@ C@@ MI communities and the D@@ C@@ MI working groups , annual conferences and educational efforts to achieve extensive acceptance of metadata standards and practices .
import images from the camera , the card reader , or the scanner . as long as the pictures are available on the camera , you can use it as temporary f@@ use .
convert Roh@@ files to D@@ NG and save it in your raw Archive . this function is not implemented yet .
for a fine @-@ layer machining you can use external programs . if you have the pictures again with &amp; digi@@ plug ; then edit the metadata back again . these were cut down under circumstances from other programs .
protect the processed pictures for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export it only then in web gal@@ eries , en@@ code in MPEG , use in contact page , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ ous ; in the addition of a photo to an album , you can find a description of how you can already have photos that you have already installed on your hard drive . but the camera interface makes you a lot of advanced settings for import@@ ing images to your Alb@@ end@@ at@@ enb@@ ank .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug ; connect them with the computer , turn the camera on the display mode and turn it on . another description can be found in the manual of your camera .
when you start the camera interface , it &apos;s trying to connect to your camera . when the connection is made , a fer@@ tile indicator appears at the lower end and the thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera will be displayed . some cameras do not appear . if this is the case , the file names and a symbol for file access is displayed for each file , photos , movies , music etc .
before you can download the photos on your computer , you may need to see the camera information about any entry . with the lateral features and metadata from the camera interface , you can see the characteristics of an entry or its metadata .
this dialog shows file properties and the photo information that are stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer . note that in some digital cameras not all information available .
the rider metadata shows the internal metadata like EX@@ IF , production remark , GPS etc. of the image . this information is the same as in the Metad@@ ata side@@ bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ ous ; or the image editing . note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button to download and then download all the photos from your camera to a single album in &amp; digi@@ . . downloading the photos will not be deleted , and we will recommend you check out the pictures to be downloaded in an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you do not want to download all photos , you can only select the desired option with the standard selection methods of &amp; k@@ . . once you choose the photos , use the button to download and then download S@@ elected . select the button chosen as long as you choose some photos .
if your camera supports this , a new option is available . these images have been downloaded from &amp; digi@@ ous . in this case , the new images are marked with a star in the preview window . if you select this option , only the new pictures will be downloaded .
if you want to download or download the buttons below , a dialog appears where you can select the target album , in which the pictures are sorted , displayed . details on the folder you can read in the section My Albums . then select the target album from the list and press OK .
after completing the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ came ; invites the photos from the camera to the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete all of them from the camera . if you want to delete all the files , you will need to select it first and then you will need to delete it out .
please note that there is no way you want to recover from the camera . if you have been deleted from the camera , you should carefully check if the photos are successfully removed from the camera . if you want to delete it from camera , you should be able to delete it from camera platforms , as this is much faster .
cameras use as fil@@ en@@ ames for the photos often not particularly meaningful name . the fil@@ en@@ ames are usually re@@ comp@@ uted after taking photos from the camera to the same album . therefore , it can be useful , the date and the time when the image has been made to in@@ corporate into the fil@@ en@@ ame .
in the next section you will find options for rotating and flip @-@ up options . if you use this latter option , a folder will be created a folder each day .
the options During the transfer will open three more options which will be performed before the photos on the record will be stored . if you select , the respective entries will be copied from the EX@@ IF information in the IP@@ TC fields . with the latest option you can correct the date and time for all downloaded images .
if you wish to do another file format as the standard format , you can use the pre@@ fix photo - % Y@@ - % m@@ - % d % H : % M : % S . for further adjustments you should read the help of the command str@@ fil@@ time .
if you use the camera name file name , you have the possibility to change the fil@@ en@@ ames in lower@@ case . or in upper@@ case letters , if you prefer this .
the new fil@@ en@@ ame , the digi@@ plug ; for a photo is used , the camera will be displayed under the name . your settings for ren@@ aming are stored and automatically used when you open the camera &apos;s next time .
&amp; digi@@ ous ; can use all information about the orientation of the camera to the time point of recording . not all cameras put this information ready . in the side@@ bar Metad@@ ata you can read more details about the information that your camera is embedded in the photo .
the automatic turn is normally turned on , and if your camera does not deliver this information , it can be turned off . if you want to turn off the automatic turn , use the button Advanced and select the automatic turn in the bottom of the window .
if your camera provides information on the date , at which the picture has been made , it can use . all images with the same date will be loaded into the same sub@@ album . not all cameras put this information available in the same sub@@ album . not all cameras will be able to check out what information your camera could have embedded in the photos .
this option is normally powered , and in this case we stores , and in this case you need to change this option . if you want to change this option , use the button Advanced and select the option Dat@@ ums@@ based subtitles at the bottom end of the window .
the easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is the button to download . then select up@@ loading . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the Standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the image selection is done , asks and digi@@ plug ; you , where the images are uploaded , select a folder selection dialog for the camera . select the desired folder and press OK to boot the up@@ loading process . the pictures are not deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Pos@@ iti@@ oning System ) is used as a general term in this document , thus the determination of the data can be displayed in long@@ itude and lat@@ itude . the identification of data can be performed by the American GPS , the Russian GLO@@ NAS , the European Galileo or any other system .
not only for professional photograph@@ ers , it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise ge@@ ographic place . not everyone uses an airplane to cap@@ itali@@ ze an area by automatic recording of GPS data . environ@@ ment@@ ers , military , police , architecture offices and real estate agents can use this ability .
if you have forgotten where exactly the photo was made , you can click with a click to open the area . if you want to loc@@ alize a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ ous user ; users who want to loc@@ alize the place of the photos so it is good to record the position data of a photo .
the question is how do the GPS data come in the picture ? first you should know that ex@@ iv@@ 2 supports many GPS data fields , such as the direction , ar@@ ches and map refer@@ encing . there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the right hardware , via a post @-@ processing of GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for ge@@ ographic classification ( manual ) and last about manual input of well @-@ known locations .
as far as we know , there is currently no camera that has a GPS unit integrated . but there are a few that work with GPS receivers , either as card module or transfer of data using a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye iP@@ A@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ric@@ oh Pro G3 Sony
downloading GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ p@@ sb@@ abel , but you must save those data in GP@@ X format , as this is the only format supported by the ge@@ ographic assignment .
there are several programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS , which can extract and cor@@ related data from images and GPS . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux ; make : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the long@@ itude and lat@@ itude or other data , then you can use this script using the Ex@@ if@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the signs hairy coordinates , e.g. by map@@ s.@@ google .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com shows no European street types . here are some European pages , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe .

Aut@@ ort@@ itel is a syn@@ onym for authors : this field should be the job title of photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a detailed description on the field of author@@ ization , this must be also filled .
publisher is a syn@@ onym for suppliers : use this field to enter the photo . this does not have to be the author , as such as Reuters , or Associated Press , then these organizations should be registered here , then this picture should be shown here . if the picture is a warehouse , then the group and agency should be shown here .
the IP@@ TC @-@ actions save the data in the respective IP@@ TC @-@ field . thereby , the metadata is permanently included in the picture and not only in the database of &amp; digi@@ ous ; this metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported without getting lost .

the default settings can be reset once again by pressing the button on the right of each category .
the settings of the indicator of &amp; digi@@ ous ; can be set on this page at the default values . however , some pictures have different sizes and synchron@@ ous mode . you should only use different sizes and synchron@@ ous mode . if you have one , then you can only receive better visibility results .
by default , the image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can use the tool bar if you use the image processing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or bright color in the image . these colors are defined here . in the image processing , this indication mode can be switched on and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chro@@ ma sub@@ sampling is meant that the images are encoded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in the colour information . please read this article in Wikipedia about the next explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with setting P@@ NG @-@ compression you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not reduce the image quality , since P@@ NG is a los@@ s@@ less algorithm . if you have a fast calcul@@ ator , you can set this value to a high compression . this means 1 : a low and 9 high compression .
with the TIFF @-@ files option you can comp@@ ress the de@@ fl@@ ate compression rati@@ os for TIFF @-@ images . this reduces the size of TIFF @-@ images . it has no effect on image quality since the de@@ fl@@ ate algorithm works loss @-@ free .
with the h@@ unter @-@ free JPEG 2000 files you can freely save yourself . even if you have been writing the los@@ s@@ hairy setting , the ratio is far better than normal JPEG . when this paragraph was written , metadata was not supported yet , but was in planning .
in previous versions of &amp; digi@@ ous , the image processing was only a picture viewer for photos . currently , it evol@@ ves quickly into a tool for manipul@@ ating your photos . with this dialogue you can change the settings of the image processing .
the default is that all the green pixels are equal to ultra@@ violet light . if you use this option , this difference is slightly soft , elimin@@ ates this problem with minimal loss of details . this option is a bit soft , elimin@@ ates the 2x@@ 2 red pattern with V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the white camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic colour balance is used .
this setting is only used when the white is not set . standard is a fixed colour balance , which was photographed on a white map that was photographed in the sunlight .
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD S@@ LR cameras . the use of the second sensors has the effect that sub@@ str@@ ated images get more details in four steps . for other cameras this option is ignored .
the standard is the sh@@ lich@@ ter , so the parts of your pictures are burned , due to the in@@ ability of your camera to capture the top quality , as it shows the tail@@ er in various Ros@@ at@@ ö@@ nen . at last , you can try to re@@ design some parts of the missing information from the top perform@@ ers .
this is possible because blue pixels is generally not as fast as green and red . &amp; digi@@ came ; and d@@ cra@@ w are therefore trying to re@@ constructed the missing blue and red portions thereof . of course this is a question how much color or white you want .
when you select the option , you get the option to set up a level . this is a value of three a compromise and / should therefore be customized for each image .
put the lumin@@ ance value according to your taste . you probably need to put it slightly higher than the default 1 . but this can also be done later in the picture options of the digi@@ plug ; to keep the time for the demo body small , you should be conservative .
a demo account algorithm is a digital image process for calcul@@ ating a complete picture of the partial data sensor , which provides many cameras and that contains a Matrix coloured pixel . this algorithm is also known as CF@@ A Inter@@ pol@@ ation or Far@@ bre@@ eds .
&amp; digi@@ came ; and D@@ cra@@ w make you three alternatives available : Bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dient ) was the first algorithm created by D@@ cra@@ w . however , he generates Far@@ bar@@ te@@ facts on the edges . Bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting when you are looking for a fast solution with acceptable result .
if you know the color devi@@ ation of your lent@@ ils , you can set the red and blue correc@@ tions here . this is certainly the best method for color devi@@ ation , as it is performed during the conversion process .
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and instructions as they should be given back . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ added ; information such as the color information from a color space in the other means that the colors are as precisely as possible .
any questions , if a picture is opened in the image processing , start the color administration module with raw files .
color profile folders You can set the folder , such as / us@@ r / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , in which you save all your profiles . &amp; digi@@ came ; examine these folders then during the start .
settings of ICC profiles you have the option &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profile setting . everything can be changed when opening the raw file later .
the color administration view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Arg@@ y@@ ll . only your pictures are not managed on the whole screen .
the input profiles should be fit for the camera and model . not all profiles are built on the same type . there are some , such as Canon , which contain no colour ton@@ ed or g@@ amm@@ ak@@ or@@ um@@ cture . currently , d@@ cra@@ w gamma not corrected for conversion at 16 bit depth . this means that you need to perform the color image yourself .
there are more options like the Soft @-@ Pro@@ of Profile , with which you can em@@ ulate , as your printer has a smaller color range when your camera has a smaller color range as your camera and some colors are therefore very sati@@ ated . you can adjust manually , instead of leaving your printer on the blind algorithm .
for most cameras , it &apos;s pretty obvious that color profile for them is intended for . unfortunately , not with the models of Canon . therefore , a table of cameras and profiles can be fit together . this answer is of course in@@ official :
the Canon profile extension allows the style to recognize : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for neutral , P for portrait and S for standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; image plug@@ in interface . it is an interface that is supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; pic@@ ks and image processing supported by providing this interface , which have been written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . select the modules you want , and these modules will then appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition you will find some also in the context menu of the preview .
Short@@ cuts for tasks that are carried out by modules can be set in menu under settings Short@@ cuts .
further information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be found via the K@@ IP@@ I project via htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the Manu@@ als of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the Di@@ asch@@ au should be easy to understand . the top kno@@ b adjust@@ s the time between the pic@@ dives , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds well . the other check@@ boxes will switch on or off , which appears at the bottom end of the images while viewing .
the camera features show a list of all supported cameras on the left side . if you want to use a camera that is connected to the computer , make sure that the camera is properly connected , switched on and in the picture mode . there are currently serial , USB and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass memory .
at the bottom end , you can set the path for USB@@ - and Fire@@ Wi@@ re@@ - ( IEEE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage camera . you have to specify a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera team . you have to specify the path / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / or , on which you hang your camera .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug ; you need to connect the camera to your computer , and turn it into display mode .
try out whether &amp; digi@@ came ; the camera automatically det@@ ects ; if not , you can set camera models and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera .
you can select any name for your camera . this is displayed in the main menu of the main window . if you have more than one camera , you can insert all here .
with the confirmation dialog for the moving of &gt; images in the tr@@ ash@@ can display , you can set the talk of &amp; digi@@ ous ; when you drop a photo in an album . in the sections drop a photos and del@@ eting of an album , you will find further details .
the editorial changes due to the right side bar can be shut down through &amp; digi@@ ous ; if you use the option changes in the right side bar without consideration . otherwise you must apply the changes to the button changes .
you can also sign the display of the welcome screen of &amp; digi@@ ous ; when starting . this acceler@@ ates the starting procedure from &amp; digi@@ ous ; .
the adjustment when you are looking for new photos , select &amp; digi@@ ous ; the basic folder was deleted by &amp; digi@@ ous . this leng@@ th@@ ens the start time of &amp; digi@@ ous files ; if something from the base folder was deleted , &amp; digi@@ plug ; you know if it is to delete it from the database .
various color schem@@ as can be used in &amp; digi@@ ous ; in order to adapt the main window to your taste . these settings can be chosen below settings design from the tool@@ bar . a preview of available designs is listed below :
these designs are defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ plug ; you will find more information about this tutorial .
&amp; digi@@ came ; contains a quick image processing with some basic tools . you can use them to view your photos and for correction and improve . image processing can be started by clicking a click with the left mouse click on the preview and selection of the entry / Edit menu .
the image processing contains a number of tools to improve your pictures . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ ous ; therefore , you are not part of your distribution . further information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules can be found in the context of image processing .
a status line at the bottom of the window , the fil@@ en@@ ame , current file number , magni@@ fying factor and the current image size .
a menu bar at the top edge and below the tool bar for quick access to the most common required functions .
the editing functions change your photos . none of the functions will change the original photo , before you have used the original photo , before you can not restore the original photo , once you have saved the original photo , once you have saved the image .
so you should possibly install a copy of your image before you change it . you can save it with file .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the Edit menu or restore the image processing in the tool@@ bar . then you will lose any change that you have carried out in the photo since the last Save .
virtually every action of the image processing can be revers@@ ed or restored . the last action you can und@@ o by editing , or restored by selecting Edit from the menu .
if you are using this frequently , you should make your key short@@ cut , C@@ trl ; -@@ z for feedback and C@@ trl ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to restore .
when you select the &amp; L@@ MB ; through the resi@@ dual or restore button in the tool bar , select a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions in between are revers@@ ed or restored .
once you started the image processing , you can move between photos in the same album or the same keyword in the tool bar , picture high , image down or the entries in the menu . if you have made changes on the current picture , you will be asked if you want to save them .
you can get in the photo in and out zo@@ oming in which you c@@ trl ; mouse wheel or symbols in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the application menu .
to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : select magni@@ fying factor automatically
view full screen mode showing the photo in full screen mode . if you don &apos;t want to use the Es@@ c key . if you don &apos;t want to use the Es@@ c key , you can also call this in the Settings dialog . if you don &apos;t like this , you can call this in the Settings dialog . you can also call this section for setting up the image processing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to print the current image , you can select the image in the menu image and get the Standard &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the main menu , you can select individual images or whole sentences . you only need to select the images with the standard methods . if you follow the wiz@@ ard , you only need to make your choice .
the digi@@ plug ; main window has a side bar on the right edge , which provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same side@@ bar is available , also available in the picture processing , if one of the five riders is clicked on :
multiple click on the same tab lets the side@@ bar appear and disappear again in the edges .
in the let@@ tering view , you can enter labels with unlimited size or paste . note that all special characters are allowed . the labels will be copied to EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC@@ s , so that you may be used by other programs .
the IP@@ TC data will only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut according to 2000 characters . if you want to use the IP@@ TC label in other applications , you should consider these restrictions .
after you commented it , use either the button User or just switch to the next picture , the labels will then be saved .
besides the user button there is a button more . you can also read further metadata from the selected file or the database . however , you can also select the metadata into the files . however , this is always carried out when you have a metadata adjustment that is always written in the images .
the rating section shows an evaluation scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in searching and sorting . it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or with the key combination C@@ trl + 0 ... 5 . to rate multiple images at the same time , select this and use the context menu .
the evaluation is written into the IP@@ TC field . coding follows the scheme in the following table :
the Key@@ word view displays a search box for fil@@ tering the keywords , the keyword tree , and a selection box with previously appeared in this &amp; digi@@ ous session .
the keyword will be dynam@@ ically adapted to the given search word . you can quickly re@@ tren@@ ch the number of possibilities in search of a keyword . this ability is especially useful if you have many keywords .
the input field at the bottom is another relief in input of keywords in a picture series . if you typ@@ ed various keywords , they will be saved for quick access .
keywords can also be set by marking the appropriate check boxes in the tree . all keywords of an image are stored in the IP@@ TC @-@ field keyword .
if several pictures are selected in the main view and select a keyword in the keyword tree , this will only be applied to the highlighted picture , if you want to choose a selection with a keyword , please read the keyword filter section .
the side@@ bar is used to change the selection of images shown in the main window . normally , the left side@@ bar is used with their album , - data , wor@@ t- and search views . if additionally , one or more keywords filter will be used from the right @-@ hand side , only the sections of these two are shown . all created keywords are available .
you can also dress and place them . suppose you have selected multiple images in the main view . if the keyword already exists , you can simply drag it out of the right side bar , and then you can put it on the selection . then , a dialog appears if you want to put the keyword .
in the top example , the main window displays the pictures on one calendar day . the keyword filter is reduced to three images . they were drawn with C@@ trl + a and after that , a keyword will be drawn from the right @-@ down tree to the selection and put it on . a dialogue asks if this keyword is to be set .
this search for changes will take place every start of the program . it can also be switched on under settings .
if you have a rule with and created , and determine that it should be one or not , you can easily change this with a double click on the text and in the control area .
( 1 ) : the entry , which is searched in the database . this can be an album , name , keyword , pattern , key term , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or a string that is already stated in the database .
for example , you can specify a Advanced search through all elements of the database using the following options :
if you want to group options , just need the check box at the end of the rule and then use the button group@@ ing . you will see the options as follows :
why are Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Flickr not listed ? free space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the images in full resolution there .
this article / Tut@@ orial was written primarily by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I have mostly adapted to &amp; digi@@ ous ; s concrete implementation adapted .
the reason why one is using a color@@ administered workflow , the colors that have actually photographed or sc@@ anned colors are the colors of your camera or scanner . with a colour@@ less workflow you can reach the colors on your camera or make the colors that you print or publish on the web to them from your digital dark chamber .
if the topic comes to colour management , everyone wants to know which buttons he must press for the results that he wants . additionally , the sense of this tutorial is to give you sufficient background information about color administration . additionally , you will make links with deeper information to make your own informed decisions .
when your picture @-@ bar meets all six criteria listed below , you don &apos;t need to worry about color administration .
they work on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated on the s@@ RGB color space . ( please find more information below )
your only other pic@@ n@@ im@@ prints are by e @-@ mail or the web , where s@@ RGB is the de facto standard .
so if s@@ RGB works so well and the life for all so simple is why you should then use another color space and thus have thoughts about color @-@ managed life ?
a visual example of the limitation of s@@ RGB compared to the colours we really can see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see the hu@@ fe@@ isen@@ shaped region , and the colors in the s@@ RGB color space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some bigger colour spaces , please visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms excell@@ ente page and click on Info and then on Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I need to kiss my monitor if I decided to work only in the s@@ RGB color space ?
yes ! if you &apos;re working in the s@@ RGB color space or not , you need to pull your monitor . if you are working in the color space of s@@ RGB , then you must use either your monitor on the s@@ RGB standard , using a suitable monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions that can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use it before you try a further manual processing .
the functions norm@@ alize , identical , automation and contrast extend from the menu Cor@@ rig@@ ize automatic correction automatically try to make your colors the best . you will need to experiment with these effects to watch what &apos;s best on your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method sc@@ aled the Illumin@@ ation values above the whole picture , so that the dar@@ k@@ est point black and the bri@@ ghtest spot is as bright as possible without its colour sh@@ ady . this function is often a magnetic correction for pictures that are dark or washed .
ab@@ orted : this method adjust@@ s the light weight of the colors of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity is as flat as possible . sometimes it has produced very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it produces only tr@@ ash . it is a very powerful operation , which causes either miracles in an image or it destroyed .
automatic ab@@ orted : this method maxim@@ izes the colour range in red , green and blue channel . it calcul@@ ates the dark and bright boundary tones and adjust the red , green and blue channels to the whole hist@@ o@@ grams zone .
contrast Exten@@ sions : this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values on the maximum possible area and a re @-@ ji@@ ing of all values in between . this is only visible in washed images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white lev@@ eling of &amp; digi@@ ous ; is a semi @-@ automated tool to carry the white ab@@ normal@@ ities of a picture .
the tin@@ ting correction is a bit limited to a color space with 8 bits per color . if you can run too far from the original image , if you are able to do so far from the original image , if you work in 16 @-@ bit mode , your possibilities will drop better to the correction .
this tool is based on a white ab@@ normal@@ ise copyright protected by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . you start the menu entry of colors of white image processing .
the preview can be adjusted in size . on the left hand side you will see both the original image and preview of the target image . if you want to see the original whit@@ eness settings , click on the sub@@ window .
the preview of the target photos has a red mark@@ ers . the L@@ umin@@ ance of Pix@@ els under this mar@@ ker is displayed as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
right above will be a hist@@ ogram shown that as soon as you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well lit pictures , most pixels are very small L@@ umin@@ ance values . with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your total is displayed . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ ance .
the contrast of your result depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and gamma . the shadow ordin@@ ation makes you improve the shadow of your photos or di@@ mming down .
An@@ stat with the above controls are used , you should use the color @-@ temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press on this button and then click on the image preview to use selected color to calculate the colour temperature of the whit@@ eness . in this way , the temperature and green values are set automatically .
in addition , you can set the white image with the list of pre@@ ferences . the following settings are available :
the exposure inde@@ xes increases the colors , when more than a color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed . it will be displayed in preview as pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
buttons Save as and load is exactly this . each setting of the white image you have set you can store it into a text file and re@@ load later .
the button settings will return all filter values to their default values and the corresponding neutral white wine . note that even neutral settings will be displayed a different photo as your original . if you save this , your original image will be changed .
you can set the code output per color channel of the processed image . 8 @-@ bit encoding is better suited to high quality images . however , this coding is also needed for high quality images . however , this coding is also needed for high quality images , calcul@@ ating time and only available for formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , TIFF and D@@ NG .
this tool opens the same dialog like the processing of raw pictures . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . it can be performed by the sub@@ window for the hel@@ lig@@ ations . a detailed instructions for use of color profiles can drag the chapter color administration .
another important tool can be found in the menu under colours color correction . this tool provides an integrated way to save multiple color channels and allow you to use them for multiple photos . this is helpful if your camera or your scanner will always need the same error , so you can always find the same correction . in the manual to the audio error you will find further information .
a very powerful possibility to correct siege problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you find under colours gra@@ dation in the menu .
the digi@@ plug ; tool colour effects provides you four colour effects , a solar panel effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a Neon Effect and a C@@ anton filter .
in times of the chemical processing , solar power was called solar power , also Sab@@ ati@@ er , a effect that was developed when they have completed a slightly developed print of a short flash . this result was a partial neg@@ atives of the image . this tool was a partial neg@@ atively of the image . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect finely .
the intensity controls the solar energy . at about 50 % intensity the picture is chem@@ ically possible . a further increase will eventually produce a negative image that is not generated on phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier .
this is an example of the solar panel . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vid filter sim@@ ulates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from a satur@@ ation to make the colours brilliant and g@@ lowing . try it easy , it emb@@ ell@@ ishes many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for a sound@@ proof@@ ed color film of the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . Vel@@ via offers very saturated color in daylight and high contra@@ sts . Vel@@ vi@@ as strongly saturated color paints are but also some photograph@@ ers , especially those who are hardly ins@@ ane , too much .
the ne@@ on@@ filter sim@@ ulates ne@@ on@@ light on the contrast edges . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the sli@@ p@@ way repe@@ ats the strength of the ne@@ on light . for big images , the filter can re@@ lie@@ ve the whole CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual to change the colour contrast and the lumin@@ osity of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors . all your adjustments can be seen in preview . once you are satisfied with the result , use the button O@@ k and you will be used .
if you make a photo in bad light conditions , you can get the opposite problem . also in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation will reduce the satur@@ ation instead of increasing your satur@@ ation . if you like the results you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tool Gra@@ dation and the simple cand@@ y / contrast / gamma tool , the tool is very complicated to improve the exposure . even if the dialog appears very complicated , you need for the application of use only . concrete the three push below the hist@@ ogram .
the window contains a graph of intensity values , an hist@@ ogram , the active canal or the selected area . under the graph , three sliding windows can be clicked into the inside and that can be moved to change the intensity values of the picture . the left side represents the dark and the right side of the bright areas .
the sim@@ pl@@ est way to learn the operation is to move the kno@@ b and take care of how the image changes .
on the right hand you can view the original and preview of the picture . the preview is dynamic , based on the settings of the picture , updated . on the left , the following options are available .
sc@@ aling : with this selection box can be set if the hist@@ ogram with a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic Y @-@ axis is displayed . for images of a constant color , the linear hist@@ ogram of a single column is dominated by a single pillar . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic classification is more useful .
three kno@@ b : the top for the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle sounds , often called gam@@ ma@@ values .
the three color pin@@ ball can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input rate of the shadows , middle and bright tones . furthermore , there is a button for fully automatic alignment .
ga@@ it values : the output values allow manual values for each area . there are also two controllers which can be used in order to change the output values , e.g. in the input rate . the compression of the output values can be used as a background to create while something else is visible in the background .
automatically : with this kno@@ b the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image .
store as and load : with these buttons , the set values in the file system can be saved and re@@ loaded later . in addition , the Gimp level format is used .
if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ p@@ ette , the inputs are automatically adjusted for all shadows , resources and sun@@ shades . select the color pi@@ p@@ ette that you want to use and click on the thumb@@ nails to set the original image of the hist@@ ogram for red , green , blue and L@@ umin@@ ance channels .
the Over@@ exposure indi@@ k@@ ator controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined outcome of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it &apos;s no effect on the final outcome .
below you can see an example of the application values applied to red , green and blue channel of a photos . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected picture ( 2 ) .
on the left , half of the original and the target image is displayed . the preview will be updated dynam@@ ically depending on your settings . on the right side the following options are available :
modifications channel : this selection box allows to specify the channel , which is modified by the module :
in addition to this box , two symbols are located between linear and a log@@ arith@@ mic view . for pictures featuring a digital camera , the linear mode generates a wide beam . in this case , the linear mode generates a wide beam . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic mode helps further .
for example , if you move a cour@@ t@@ eil to the right , e.g. the bright tones , then you can see that these bright tones sounded with dar@@ ker output and the related image pixel are dar@@ ker .
on the preview of the original photos is a red markings to see . if you want to change this mark on the area you want to change the original value . create a dot on this line and move it up and down , until the value is adjusted to your taste .
store as and load : with these buttons you can do exactly that . every curve that you have generated is stored in the file system and later the file format is the Gimp cam format .
if you want this method and the three color pi@@ p@@ ette buttons automatically create the control points for all channels of the shade , middle and sun tones . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette that you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for red , green , blu@@ e- and L@@ umin@@ anz@@ kur@@ ve .
the Over@@ exposure indi@@ k@@ ator controls all color channels to display superior pixel . if in more than one channel , you get the combined result . this is a indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it &apos;s no effect on the final outcome .
below you can see a black @-@ and @-@ white photo , which has been corrected in the L@@ umin@@ ance Channel . shadow and sun tones used with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel mixer der &amp; digi@@ came ; image processing is a tool to improve the colour channels or change the colour cas@@ ings of the photos .
the channel bl@@ ender is another sophisticated tool to mix the colour shades of the pictures . you can edit it from the colors channel bl@@ ender of the screen processing .
with the can@@ al@@ selection box you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram . this gives you a first note how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and r@@ ash . the left area of the window shows you a preview of . the original can be viewed by comparison of your own rider .
the preview of the target image has a red mar@@ ker . if you move it in picture a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram to show you the corresponding color value .
the controls for the module are on the right below : controls for red , green and construction allow you to change these channels . if you enable L@@ umin@@ ance , you can also use the corresponding color components . this is especially convenient if you can also reduce the corresponding colour components . try to reduce the Flash @-@ and @-@ white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits .
sometimes , especially when you mix Mon@@ ochro@@ me , the reduction in a visible color will emerge from the same place . if this is the case , you can improve your Mon@@ ochro@@ me conversion in which you can reduce the color of color .
the Save as and load buttons are used precisely for this purpose . any con@@ current Mixer allows you to save and then load . the used file format is the Gimp @-@ channel format .
the Over@@ exposure indi@@ k@@ ator controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined outcome of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it &apos;s no effect on the final outcome .
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been adjusted . the original image is enabled . you can see the original image below ( 1 ) and the original image below ( 2 ) .
black / white photograph was always fascinating because of your abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a work step , since color images can be easily converted to the computer . also with a set of film roller profiles .

with the digi@@ plug ; tool texture , you can apply decorative tex@@ tures on one picture .
by adding a texture to your image , regardless of it &apos;s a color picture or not , you can look like an oil painting on a canvas , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or as a wall picture on a wall . the menu entry image texture can be used for it .
relief : move this parameter to the right increases the depth of the depth or three @-@ dimensional texture of texture .
a paper texture effect has been applied on the picture below . the original image is ( 1 ) and that changed under ( 2 ) . the parameter relief has been set to 200 .
with the digi@@ plug ; add tool frame can be added a decorative frame around one picture .
the eye of a viewer &apos;s eye is no easy task . a possibility to keep his attention is to put the picture a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the atter@@ ing eye . in the frame of the frame , the module can be started .
type : with this parameter you set the desired cream type for your image . permanently , the image with a colored line , Nie@@ p@@ ce surro@@ unds it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white pictures ) , with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame which is ideal for a touch of touch and decor@@ ative add a ornam@@ ental frame with patterns .
width : specifies the width of the frame in percent . the value range for width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
this target range becomes bigger than the original , but have the same aspect ratio . this is important for the print of images , especially when you cut the tool after side rati@@ os before use .
with this practical tool , you can insert an easy @-@ format text into a picture of any location . this also includes several places when you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply type the text and place it with the mouse . the larger the image you need . the larger the picture , the larger the character set must be . at the end , simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; any setting that you have chosen for your text can be changed until you click the button &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OK &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; after the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it cannot be changed anymore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the digi@@ plug ; tool template apply you can put a template about one image .
the Edit Photo template in the image processing can be used to put templates on a picture .
for sten@@ cil there is no restrictions regarding size and orientation . if you want to add the P@@ NG file format and you should add a maximum compression ( 9 ) to add file size . if you want to add an e @-@ mail in English to the digi@@ plug ; Mail@@ ing list digi@@ came @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org ..
if you use this tool for the first time , you need to put your template folder with the button basic folder in the dialog . select the folder in which you can copy the template files .
after the root folder for sten@@ cils has been set , a tree view which reflects the folder structure of the template &apos;s folder . the selection of a folder is updated automatically .
under the preview there are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fying factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this button increases the underlying image . it is cent@@ ered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
size : this kno@@ b resi@@ zed below the underlying picture . it is cent@@ ered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template onto the whole picture , check the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move : use this button to post@@ p@@ one the picture below the template . take the image and place it on the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template onto your image . then the image will be adapted automatically .
&amp; digi@@ came ; manufactures three different tools for shar@@ pen@@ ing . each of you have advantages in other areas .
shar@@ pen@@ ing is a traditional tool for shar@@ pen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy , but creates especially in dark areas , gra@@ ined pictures .
the sharp@@ ness mask works on the contrast of the edges to look shar@@ pen@@ ed . in fact , it doesn &apos;t work a bit , it works more mentally . you can use it a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gimp and he is protected by Winst@@ on Chang .
focus might be the best of the three because it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little complicated in its application and has different parameters for adaptation .
photos without focus as well as most digit@@ alized images need a correction of the sharp@@ ness . this is the same thing that sharp edges are put together with only minimal differences . the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper . S@@ LR cameras normally need more retro@@ fit than normal cameras for the private application .
in JPEG pictures , a camera has been applied internal shar@@ pen@@ ing . images in the raw format against it must always be weak@@ ened during processing .
a few scanners apply a shar@@ pen@@ ing filter during the reading of the image . if you disable this , you get control of your image .
in some situations you can get useful results by shar@@ pen@@ ing a photo using the shar@@ pen@@ ing value . you can call it with the menu entry cor@@ rig@@ ating sharp@@ ness .
but you should fix it carefully , as the results are not very natural . the shar@@ pen@@ ing increases sharp@@ ness of edges , but also ampli@@ fy the noise . in general , you can focus on the menu entry . in general , you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for shar@@ pen@@ ing .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy . the solution to draw a bit less than it is much easier than it . use the tool for soft@@ war@@ fare with the menu entry cor@@ rig@@ ation soft@@ ly and experiment@@ ing with Settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter must be sharp mas@@ ks is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and the preview help edit the picture . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values produce often good results and should be tried first . if you make the sharp@@ ness mask deeply , noise and impression of gr@@ ats will generate near sharp edges .
the radius poses as many pixels on each side of a can@@ te affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow greater radi@@ i . you should therefore print images at best in their final resolution .
the amount is added to the percentage between the original and the wis@@ ely image that is added to the original . thereby , the strength of the edge is placed .
the swelling value is a fra@@ ction from the maximum RGB value and the amount of difference . you can thus define a minimum difference thus for a can@@ te of the filter . in this way , areas with a soft change between shar@@ pen@@ es and therefore beauty errors are avoided in faces , sk@@ ies and water surface areas .
this is an example of the un@@ sharp mas@@ c@@ ate filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) and the processed image has been applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a sw@@ ell@@ value = 0.@@ 0 .
the digi@@ plug ; tool re@@ focusing re@@ focuses on a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copyright protected de@@ pressing filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries to create a picture &amp; quot ; re@@ foc@@ uss@@ ed ; in which it &apos;s a technique called F@@ IR Vienna fil@@ tering . this is using a technique called F@@ IR Wiener Fil@@ tr@@ . it is using a technique called F@@ IR Wiener Fil@@ tr@@ . you can start using a technique called F@@ IR Vienna fil@@ tering . you can launch it from the menu by calling colors re@@ focus in image processing .
in practice , the circular saw is much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;s folding . the Gau@@ ß &apos;s folding line has a very long tail , which causes the mathematical result too far from the spring bl@@ ink , which is far affected by the original pixel size . the F@@ IR Vienna In@@ verse is even heavily influenced by the distant pixels . it causes undes@@ i@@ rable results .
circular tip : this is the radius of circular folding . it is the most important parameter for use this module . for most images the default value should set the value of 1 good results , but if your image is very un@@ sharp , but should pay attention to hal@@ o .
cor@@ relation : an increase in cor@@ relation can help you reduce arti@@ facts . the cor@@ relation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . useful values are 0,5 and the values near 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0,@@ 99 . a high value for the cor@@ relation reduces the sharp@@ ness effect of the module .
Rau@@ sch@@ filter : an increase in the smoking filter can help you accept arti@@ facts . however , values are higher than 0.1 , &amp; eg ; 0 is the image quality very bad . a usable value is 0,@@ 03 . a high value is still heavily poll@@ uted .
Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness . in most cases , use this parameter to avoid annoying ar@@ te@@ facts . if you use a value zero , you may also have to increase the cor@@ relation and / or the smoking filter .
Mat@@ ri@@ zen@@ ith : this value determines the size of transformation material . however , if you choose great values for the circular tip or the Gau@@ ß &apos;s edge . note that the module is very slow when you select major values for this parameter . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
the Save as and load buttons are used precisely for this purpose . any re@@ focus parameter you have set is thus stored for later and can be loaded .
try to execute all enco@@ ders , color and intensity sk@@ ul@@ tures on the picture before using the module .
otherwise you should use the module , before you can change the image otherwise . the reason for this is that much operations make changes not immediately visible , but later left un@@ comfortable arti@@ facts .
if you read and comp@@ ress images , &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
generally , un@@ sharp mas@@ ks produce better results than shar@@ pen@@ ing . this could cause this to be causing un@@ sharp mas@@ ks a bigger neighborhood than shar@@ pen@@ ing .
theore@@ tically , un@@ sharp mas@@ ks must always create arti@@ facts . even under optimal conditions , it can never show the effect of the im@@ perme@@ ate filter . practically , the result of the F@@ IR Vi@@ enn@@ ese filter is always at least as good as the imm@@ ac@@ ity mask . the F@@ IR Vi@@ enn@@ ese filter is often better when processing small details .
below you can view a comparison between different filters , on a small , focused image :
this image has to be corrected . this picture has been taken with an analog camera . the un@@ foc@@ uss@@ ed result is due to in@@ sufficient light for the auto focus lens .
for more information about the methods of focus in digital images , you can consult a technical comparison in English under this address .
the regulator sp@@ read@@ ed the sharp@@ ness of the range of the dark zone , in order to create a more natural P@@ up@@ ille .
colour tin@@ ts allows the customized colour for P@@ up@@ ille . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , then you can set this here .
the tool &apos;s image error correction is one of the most advanced tool designed to remove the desired arti@@ facts with un@@ preced@@ ented speed .
the in@@ feed algorithm was developed by the IM@@ AGE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en , France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains various pre@@ ferences than Star@@ ts to simpli@@ fy the restoration . the available pre@@ ferences are listed below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings , you can use the rider smooth@@ ing and advanced settings .
detail @-@ keeping p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the maintenance of details . a small value leads to a uniform gli@@ ding over the image . what is needed to suggest larger values mainly hom@@ o@@ gene@@ ous regions and details . a value of 0.9 should not be avoided . please note that detail protection always should be sub@@ ordin@@ ated .
accuracy ad@@ diction alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smo@@ ked evenly into all directions , while a value is near to 1 only in one direction . if you generate a high value wave @-@ like pattern . JPEG arti@@ facts are best removed at a value near 1 .
smooth@@ ing &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum glasses factor via all@@ es@@ . p then defines the relative smooth@@ ing . therefore , set this value matching the degree of smoking in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects greater structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is needed , as it is difficult to generate the geomet@@ ry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ let effect , it must be set higher than 3 .
repet@@ itions : are there how often the algorithm is running through . usually 1 or 2 is enough .
An@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha version &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angular @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if alpha is small , it should also be selected too . take this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs .
integral stri@@ de length &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral stri@@ de length in pixels . you should avoid the value of smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smooth@@ ing and never larger than 2 .
linear inter@@ pol@@ ation use : the More to quality you get through the choice of this option is only minor . it doubles the run@@ time . we therefore recommend it to allow him out .
buttons Save as and load does exactly this . any setting of image errors can be saved in a text file and later re@@ loaded .
image errors are compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and take a high CPU load . you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the button crash .
below you can see how image errors have been corrected with little arti@@ facts . the module is shown on a photo that was created in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you can see it is a pec@@ uli@@ ar movie storage during the trip . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; smoking reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce image noise . it uses a protected algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides sel@@ ectable video filters , to remove st@@ ains and other arti@@ facts , e.g. dust or hair on the lens , too . it can also be used to remove sensors from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ alism ; effects from sc@@ anned images from books or magazines .
if you need further information about digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial .
the screen picture above shows a typical scene that has been made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a grain size , which can be used successfully with this tool .
in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window and the Advanced Settings menu can remain at the default settings .
radius controlled the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 41@@ x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . great values improve the time that the filter is needed per pixel and can be used through the radius described by the radius and the color in it is smooth@@ ed and thus smaller mistakes are adjusted .
sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness . this value sets the pixel pitch of the filter to be fixed . if it is increased , you may need to re @-@ adjust the edges of the filter . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter image details cannot be obtained and r@@ ushing down again .
edges : controls the edge accuracy of the shar@@ pen@@ ing . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong , not the entire room can be removed or rou@@ gh@@ ness can occur . if you want to remove a weak r@@ ushing or JPEG arti@@ facts , you want to lose weight without details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the ligh@@ tings of the image . we recommend to change either color or light@@ density to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the glass process which is controlled by the details settings .
colour : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend to change either color or light@@ density to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the glass process which is controlled by the details settings .
gamma : controls the Gam@@ mat@@ ol@@ er@@ ance of the picture . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of dar@@ ker areas , which typically are stronger , however , also the shadow areas .
absorption : controls the adjustment of the ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter@@ ing absorption . this value is defined as quickly the adap@@ tive filter radius on variations of the lumin@@ ance . if it is raised , the edges can appear . it can remove noise and Ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter on the edges . it can remove noise points and is the recommended method for it .
store under and load : these buttons are used precisely for this . all parameters for the noise reduction which you have set can be stored into the file system and then loaded .
this is an example of how the reduction of your life can change . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) was applied to the default settings .
sometimes a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . the solution to draw a bit soft , is fortunately much simpler than a picture to shar@@ k . use this tool for soft@@ war@@ fare and experiment@@ ing with the smooth@@ ing . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ came ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools for photo ar@@ te@@ facts .
this filter for rest@@ oring gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted arti@@ facts from your pictures . it is very well adapted to remove sn@@ ails , scrat@@ ches , scrat@@ ches and local mistakes produced in digital , original or retro@@ actively digit@@ ised images . thereby , the smooth@@ ing occurs along the picture con@@ tours and thereby gets the content as it also makes human eye .
the same algorithm can be used for colour and tex@@ turing . the algorithm has been developed using another tool , image error correction . the algorithm for restoration was developed by the IM@@ AGE Team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ ich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG ar@@ te@@ facts reduce : the compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas , it creates some comp@@ resses &amp; quot ; arti@@ fact quot ; - small standards that are in un@@ compressed image . this setting should correct these problems .
buttons Save as and shop make exactly this . each setting of photo restoration can be saved in a text file and later re@@ loaded .
photo restoration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and take a high CPU load . you can therefore break the calculation at any time using the button .
below you can reduce the picture of a photo with a uni@@ form@@ ulation of 3200 ISO .. The module is applied to a black and white photo that was recorded with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( TM ) HP @-@ 5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious film gra@@ ins on the faces . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time tex@@ tures can be seen on an old colour picture taken with a scanner . you can see the scan ar@@ te@@ facts created by sc@@ ann@@ er@@ lighting and the photo v@@ ulture . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ came ; Tool Hot@@ pixel makes it Hot@@ pixel of photos that have been fitted with a CCD camera , eight were used to remove algorithms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pi@@ xi project , which are protected by copyright by Martin Dick@@ opp .
bright , dead , or hot pixels are a problem with high quality raw mode photos , as many cameras have JPEG compression via a built @-@ in supp@@ ression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot Pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright Pix@@ el@@ quot ; &quot; there is no manual method to select the bad pixel .
download this file in the wiz@@ ard with the button dark . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the image preview .
if you have an old digital camera , it is important to record the dark picture directly in the connection to discover new hot or light pixels by CCD defects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should find the matching dark picture to the correct picture . an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixel . note that the wiz@@ ard will re@@ print the last night@@ fall and re@@ charges this automatically in the next session .
the image area and the preview help you correct the result in the image . the thumb@@ nails shows the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are highlighted in all segments .
select an area to preview the defective pixel on the preview and the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to pol@@ ate these pixel p@@ eg@@ s . these are the available filters :
Dur@@ an : an average of the neighbouring pixels is determined . the resulting colour is assigned to all def@@ ens@@ ers in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation this is done separately for horizontal and vertical lines .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are dra@@ gged to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to pol@@ ate the defective pixel in the block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are moved to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
Kub@@ isch : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are moved to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to pol@@ ate the defective pixel in the block .
below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long expos@@ ures . the original image has been increased to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the vig@@ net@@ ing , i.e. under@@ lined corners , an image .
wide angle lens , especially those in the medium and large photo format , frequently illumin@@ ate the whole sensor range not equally light . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ ting quot ; ( shaded ) they can reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the sensor cap@@ tiv@@ ating . Tel@@ e@@ Ob@@ jective could also show this behavior .
but he has draw@@ backs . many Center filters need a factor 1.5 or 2 at the aper@@ ture filter , which is impossible to hold the camera by hand . wide angle lens should also use with center filter , an opening of f / 16 or less , as otherwise sense effects are caused by movement .
with the large exposure ranges of digital cameras and film scanners , it is possible to sim@@ ulate the effect of a C@@ enter@@ Filter by using an equi@@ val@@ ent transformation in a body image that is made without these filters . the tool is protected by a C@@ enter@@ filter . the algorithm is protected by John Walker .
using three shelves , you can control the vig@@ net@@ ting correction filter and with three further parameters of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light star@@ chy absorption at the point of the largest density to compens@@ ate the filter . the default density is 2.0 , or randomly offset the density of a greater degree of vig@@ net@@ ting , reduce it to offset a small degree .
Leu@@ ch@@ starch , contrast and gamma @-@ settings : the editing of an image with the vig@@ net@@ ting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels . you have to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . the controls provide you only positive values , as you just need to raise the settings .
if you want a fin@@ er re @-@ adjust of exposure to finish , let the values for lumin@@ osity / contrast / Gamma at zero and use the gra@@ dation of the digi@@ plug ; picture processing from the menu color gra@@ dation .
this is an example of the vig@@ net@@ ting correction to an image . the original image ( 1 ) shows the correct picture in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected picture . a den@@ ial and contra@@ sting correction was also performed with this tool .
the digi@@ p@@ lock is a tool to correct the effect of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a protected algorithm by David Ho@@ d@@ son .
this tool works with geomet@@ ric dist@@ or@@ tions . colour dist@@ or@@ tions cannot be corrected using this tool .
the coefficient of the second gra@@ dient handles the general geomet@@ ric dist@@ ortion of the lens and can correct the con@@ cave or con@@ ve@@ x form of the image .
the coefficient of the third degree has a similar circuit effect , but laughs at the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool .
the coefficient of fourth gra@@ des correc@@ ts the remote corners attached to that of the second degree . if you combine these two geomet@@ ric dist@@ ortion , almost eliminated is eliminated .
general : this value controls the strength of the dist@@ ortion of the second degree . with negative values , tons of dist@@ orted dist@@ or@@ tions are corrected and positive values of con@@ scientious ob@@ struction .
corner : this value controls the power of dist@@ ortion fourth se@@ des . this value is stronger on the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses , the &apos; corners parameter has the opposite sign of the parameter General .
zoom : this value sc@@ aled the image size and thus leads to the correction of the first degree through . negative values enlarge while positive the picture shr@@ inks .
light : this value adjustment the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values reduce the brightness of the image in the corners during positive values they increase .
to help you find the best filter settings , illustrates the dialog with a preview of correction . the values you use for your image are stored and used for the next start as default values .
the broad / res@@ p @-@ shaped correction was to be performed prior to all cutting or size changes . best , you perform this correction as all first . if you want to re@@ cut a picture and then make a broad @-@ shaped correction , the effect would become apparent .
to help you find the best correction line you will find this tool a vertical and a horizontal aux@@ iliary range . move it to an important place to fix the dot@@ ted lines . in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this place . in the connection you can correct the broad / k@@ ins@@ ular dist@@ ortion with the help of the lines .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you correct a c@@ ylind@@ rical dist@@ ortion , the resulting image will have black ver@@ tices . you can remove this with the cutting tool transform@@ ers from the image processing or the zoom regulator of this dialog . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for most pictures the broad @-@ shaped correction is sufficient . the next logical step for some motives , such as recordings of the front , frame and paintings are the perspective to correct the angle in the picture 90 degrees . note that if you hold the camera with your hand , you will always have a slight dist@@ ortion of perspective .
this is an example of the broad @-@ shaped correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method to sim@@ ulate infrared movie of the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org website which is accessible under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( TM ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ infrared film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window , you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the image .
below the preview you can add two parameters to adjust movie gra@@ ins and movie sensitivity ( ISO ) . the ISO kno@@ b changes the quantity of the gra@@ ins and domin@@ ance of color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in conversion . green meadows are white as snow !
since the filters color channels are mixed for re@@ produce infrared film , especially the green channel makes it no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos since the colour information is missing .
this is an example of the infrared optical filter used on a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is set under ( 1 ) and the original image has been set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values generate a kind of aura in the branches .
the digi@@ plug ; filter film shelf is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to re@@ produce film @-@ gra@@ ding on your pictures . this is of classic high @-@ speed movies such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the films , the makers mix great silver gra@@ ins of the photo emul@@ sion .
the film@@ strip effect gives your photo a certain mood or appears to move back into the past . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , street photographic , gra@@ zing sight especially in your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , you have to use this filter .
using the regulator , the ISO sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ular@@ ity of gra@@ ins . the default value is , although often higher values are needed , on ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need more gra@@ ins , then you can apply the filter several times .
this is an example of the film@@ strip thickness onto a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that worked ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity is ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; filter oil painting generates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; filter oil paintings gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting . natural pictures and sty@@ list@@ ings are good for this effect .
there are two controls to affect this effect . the top elec@@ ts the pin size between one and five . thick brushes are better suited for great pictures . smooth@@ ing the smooth@@ ness or , viewed from the other side , the char@@ ist .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the original is marked with ( 2 ) . brush size for this 640 pixel size is 1 and smooth@@ te 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ came ; filter charcoal drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dient to produce a cab@@ bage in drawing . therefore images whose gra@@ dients may change slowly but are not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you could have chosen that scene you could have chosen to sk@@ etch . this would be good pictures to start with it .
there are two controls with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper kno@@ b elec@@ ts the pin size and the lower adjust@@ s the contrast ( smooth@@ te ) .
this is an example of the carbon copy filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the changed image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
the digi@@ plug ; filter engraving shaped your image in 3 @-@ D , as if it was stamped in wax . it uses an protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the digi@@ ous laser engraving is a fast tool to give your pictures again with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well with images with a simple structure , with which color is not the most important part of the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the picture into a grey , mon@@ umental landscape .
the depth allows the contrast of the fil@@ tering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % is the default setting .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by dist@@ ortion effects . it uses protected algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
shaft block 1 : divi@@ ding the picture in cells and looks like it is considered by glass blocks .
shaft blocks 2 : analog@@ ous to the shaft block 1 the image is dist@@ orted here with another version of glass blocks .
some effects require a long time to calculate and create a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects anytime with the button .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo in a work of art by means of im@@ perme@@ ate effects . it uses protected algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom In@@ flu@@ ff : wi@@ ped out the image along st@@ ern@@ able lines leading from a centre . this sim@@ ulates the im@@ perme@@ ation of a zo@@ oming camera and thus creating a dynamic expression of often in sporting photography .
Radi@@ al Un@@ ity : wi@@ pe off the image by rotating the pixels at a point . this sim@@ ulates the im@@ perme@@ ation of a rotating camera .
distance un@@ sharp@@ ness : wi@@ pe the image to generate the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object appears back in the background .
movement of motion : wi@@ pe the image through horizontal movements of pixels . this sim@@ ulates the def@@ use of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train photographic , camera .
soft sharp@@ ness : wi@@ pe the image soft into the dark and strong in bright tones . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ our photos , or add a warm and subtle glow .
sh@@ aking : wi@@ ped the image by random shifting of pixels and sim@@ ulates the sharp@@ ness of an arbit@@ r@@ ary moving camera .
intelligent In@@ sharp@@ ness : finds the p@@ add@@ ling pool in the picture and wi@@ pes them without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : share the photo in rectangular cells and then create it by the filling with an average pixel value , new .
some effects require a long time to calculate and create a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel this calculation at any time with the button .
the shelves are a nice small tool to make reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ es on your image . this makes it natural pictures an awesome look . it uses a Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n protected by protected algorithm .
dri@@ p size allows the size of the drops to change . since the size of the image is not automatic , it is often necessary to reduce the size of the image . number changes the number and density of drops . Fisch@@ au@@ gen changes the optical effect of drops in the image .
you can hold with the digi@@ plug ; image processing a range free from ra@@ ind@@ rops . use the range of tools to choose the area , e.g. a face that will remain free of charge . if you start the filter reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ es , the area will remain free from ra@@ ind@@ rops .
this is an example of the Reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ fen Fil@@ ters . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the painted picture ( 2 ) indicates a sunset over a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can bring it through mirrors or rotating in the right orientation . you will find the tools transform@@ ers in the transform@@ ers , rotating respectively .
photo infl@@ atable is definitely one of the most advanced tools designed to enlarge a photo at a minimal loss of image quality .
a picture to shr@@ ink is simple . the big question is how can you infl@@ ate an image and keep the details sharp ? how can you re@@ invent the missing information again ? how can you re@@ invent the missing information ? how can you re@@ invent the missing information here ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm is here a good job . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo is the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . select transform@@ ers size change in the menu and specify the target values . the dialog is below .
the tool for the size change uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to enlarge the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool for infl@@ ating .
many educational programs use a kind of pol@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. Spl@@ ine inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge one image . &amp; digi@@ came ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo set was developed by the IM@@ AGE Team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you need to say the tool like you want to change the size . these settings are available in the tab new size and are listed below :
maintain side ratio : if this setting is enabled , at entering the new size , the aspect ratio of the original image is maintained .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects greater structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is needed , as it is difficult to generate the geomet@@ ry of the image . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Gogh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect , it must be set higher than 3 .
buttons Save as and load are used exactly . each photograph for photo can be saved as text file and will be loaded later .
photo infl@@ atable is very fast when it does , but it can still take a long time and take a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button .
you can see an example of the picture below , by increasing a small color image to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged image ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of the linear standard enlargement comparison .
cutting a photo is not only a common operation , but also a common tool to put together a picture . simply to cut a photo with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and pull the rect@@ angle , you will then see this rect@@ angle you &apos;ll see the mouse .
when you release the mouse button , the area of the photos will be cut out . you can change a good overview of how your photo would look like . you can create the size of the right area by clicking on the corners of the rect@@ angle , by using a new rect@@ angle using the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with the cutting table , use the button The C@@ utter button of image processing in the tool bar and the photo is cut ( C@@ trl ; + X ) . use the file Save or Save file under the file to save the newly allocated photo .
in the fo@@ aming process , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog remains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the tool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cut aspect ratio &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can specify the orientation as high @-@ format or horizontal format . in the high format , the larger value of height and in the cross format is always assigned . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tool after aspect ratio is used to cut a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same as if you use cen@@ tim@@ eters , in@@ ch or any other physical size . you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo v@@ ulture and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog , two buttons are to be automatically cent@@ ered horizont@@ ally or vertically .
below the dialog you can set with the Max . ratio button to cut the area to the maximum possible depending on the chosen ratio and orientation .
the tool can be cut according to the aspect ratio ( horizontal or vertical ) . if you are using the cutting tool , these settings are stored in the EX@@ IF tables , so that the EX@@ IF data will be reflected in the EX@@ IF data , so that the EX@@ IF data reflect the cut image and not the original image .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the settings of support help allow help to da@@ zzle out , so that you can put your images better . these help are : &quot; &quot; &quot;
harmon@@ ic triangle : harmon@@ ic particles are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third party , harmon@@ ic triangles are possible to share a rect@@ angle in a similar harmon@@ ic triangles .
golden middle : the golden middle is a division that is on different natural growth patterns like e.g. the spiral of a Naut@@ il@@ us mus@@ sel or the leaves of a Sun@@ flower . it emerges in all possible things we feel as beautiful .
the golden division is the Ir@@ r@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was already used in ancient Egypt and Greeks used to construct the golden pitch in all times when you put your paintings , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number is derived from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; from where every number is equal to 1 equal to the sum of its two leading figures . a composition that this rule is considered visually harmon@@ ically .
the golden middle provides liquid aux@@ iliary lines when you put a picture together . these help are listed below :
the Golden Spir@@ al will bring you good results for your photos . in comparison to the third party , the golden spir@@ als produces a liquid line of the eye through the picture . this type of composition introduces the views along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ ric visual river .
another rule is the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spir@@ als , also called golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . this sp@@ ind@@ ran@@ gles is used to create the golden spir@@ als . this can be a line or different objects . this somewhat can be simply because without the eye , it will fulfil its task .
the golden triangles are also derived from the above @-@ mentioned golden spiral . note that in contrast to harmon@@ ic triangles , golden triangles are no equivalent triangles . diag@@ onal to these lines can be a static object dynamic .
when you use golden triangles to break your frame , create a effect of creating professional photographer dynamic sym@@ met@@ ry . try to place your image focus on one of the chi@@ ves and other visual information in the triangles . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot reach differently .
the options horizontal reflect and vertical mir@@ r@@ ents can be used to reflect the harmon@@ ic particles .
with the button color you can set the paint of relief lines . if you have a picture of many colors and a high contrast , the relief lines can be invisible . you can adjust the color of lines in your current image .
the free rotation is a tool to rotate an image of any angle .
if you make a photo , it &apos;s easy to fix the camera not exactly vertically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which the things are rot@@ ated by an angle . you can fix this with the digi@@ plug ; image processing and the tool free rotation . select Transform@@ ations Free Rotation and adjust the target angle .
turn your picture with the sli@@ der angle . the values on this sli@@ p@@ case are indicated in degrees . by button settings , you can set the slide back to 0 degrees . a preview of rotation is available on the right @-@ hand side of the window . the new dimensions of the picture are displayed right above .
at your help , the free rotation module provides a horizontal and vertical line . move the mouse cur@@ sor in the image preview to position the two lines . now you can adjust it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in previous section .
after you shot a picture , you &apos;ll find unwanted three @-@ like holes in the corners . one way to fix it is to use the function transform@@ ers from the image processing .
an elegant way to cut the picture is the function Automatic Cut . choose one of the following options :
the option anti @-@ ali@@ asing smooth@@ s the image a bit after the turn . note the above warning .
all per@@ spec@@ tiv@@ al transform@@ ations are performed to a fixed point in the so @-@ called reference point . this point is shown in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective , you need to use the red squares at the corners of your picture . the preview will then be automatically calculated . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information which will help you to change the perspective :
new width : shows the width of the new image , including empty areas which are created through the transformation .
new height : displays the height of the new picture , including empty areas which are created by the transformation , in pixels .
angle left : displays the current angle in degrees on the top left of the transformed territory .
angle Right : displays the current angle in degrees on the upper right corner of the transformed territory .
angle Left : displays the current angle in degrees on the lower left corner of the transformed territory .
angle Right below : displays the current angle in degrees on the lower right corner of the transformed territory .
after adjusting the perspective , the image will be somewhat poll@@ uted . for a single adaptation this effect is small , but two adap@@ t@@ ations produce a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you have adapted the perspective , you get un@@ happy dirty holes on the corners . one way to see it is the picture with transform@@ ers cutting out of the picture processing .
the tool is used to move a portion of the picture in one direction and move the other part to the opposite . this is not rotation , the picture is dist@@ orted . in other words , a rect@@ angle is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can start this module about transform@@ ers .
she@@ er your image by pressing the horizontal angle and the vertical angle . you can set horizont@@ ally and vertically . if you push for pres@@ ets , the angle to zero will be displayed . a preview of the effect will be displayed on you and the new dimensions of the target range will be shown on the right of the thumb@@ nail .
for your help , a vertical and horizontal line appears . move the mouse to an important point , like e.g. the lake , a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to adjust the lines to adjust your image .
after completing the calibration , the image will get a bit wi@@ ped out . for a single shift , this effect is generally negli@@ gible , but two ch@@ ings produced twice as much desol@@ ation and so you should avoid this .
after shifting , the image has un@@ tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate it is the picture with transform@@ ers cutting out of the picture processing .
&amp; digi@@ came ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write about image formats . in some cases , you will depend on your system and , in some cases , from the type as these libraries comp@@ ili@@ ert . in most distri@@ butions , you will need a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ plug ; edit .
because of this dependence on other libraries , it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on their system . however , you &apos;ll always find JPEG and TIFF .
&amp; digi@@ came ; displays only files in file formats . this is done using the file extension and a comparison of this with a pre @-@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list . you can change this list of file extensions . you can change this list of file extensions . you can find further information in the list .
virtually all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras allow you to choose to use format . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ came ; supports both formats .
image compression is the use of data compression procedures on digital images . redundant information is reduced to save the image data to a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general there are better , smooth results as JPEG at the same compression ratio . the 200@@ 0s version can also be saved freely , if it is indicated in the settings .
if you want to know more about the pipe format , you can read more about Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English . you can find raw format pictures in JPEG or TIFF with the Roh@@ Image Converter from &amp; digi@@ added ; in the section configuration you will find further information on the use of modules with &amp; digi@@ plug ; .
&amp; digi@@ came ; supports the loading of raw pictures only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is supported in &amp; digi@@ ous formats . all support cameras can be seen below at the web site of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw formats that are supported by &amp; digi@@ ous ; supported :
many digital cameras support the recording short films . these clips are often stored in the avi@@ ary or MPEG @-@ format . here &apos;s no film processing program and is therefore not working on film files . if you click on a movie file , click here . if you click on a movie file , click Sli@@ de ; the &amp; k@@ de ; Settings to Play movies to play the program .
go forward to the previously visited album in chron@@ icles . you can only go forward if you went back before .
synchron@@ ize the metadata between the database and all files of the current main window . the images are the metadata of the database and not otherwise around like this menu .

all configured cameras are shown here . you can use the entry camera add from the menu to add a new camera to the list . please check in the camera &apos;s section after further information .
K@@ IP@@ I module , which exports a series of images into a K@@ ML structure . K@@ ML files can be opened and displayed with Google Earth .
if you can exchange the steps 4 and 5 , what you can do well if the initial contrast was very good , then you can carry out the first four alignment with the White module .
many tools you need the processing preparation are in &amp; digi@@ came ; included . your description follows here .
all image processing tools such as shar@@ pen@@ ing , sof@@ ar , spac@@ ing , reproduction , focus on preview displays before the filter is applied in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you see &amp; quot ; texture user quot ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this progress indicator shows the status of the filter on the current image . on the left of him , five buttons are allowing to change the comparison mode of the acting area . these modes are :
vertically divide without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area right of the selected thumb@@ nail .
horizontal with no dup@@ lic@@ ates . the upper area shows the original and bottom shows the filter applied on the range below the selected thumb@@ nail .
the left area displays the original and the right to compare the filter &apos;s effect .
set horizont@@ ally . the upper area shows the original and the lower compared to the effect of the filter .
&apos;@@ mouse over &apos; -@@ style : preview if the mouse is not in the hall@@ way and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can turn on to display over@@ - and exposure . the used colors can be adjusted in the general settings page .
( 3 ) : the frame to preview the preview . you can draw this frame with the mouse within the picture and on the part of the picture you want to see . the preview in the left part of the dialogue will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all inser@@ tion from the last use of the module will be noted .
the side@@ bar characteristics shows the essential information on the selected image and is largely declared . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo properties : shows a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photos . these data are from the EX@@ IF data , if they are available .
this tab is an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . press C@@ trl ; left mouse button to pull out a square . all images within this co @-@ ordin@@ ates are filtered and displayed . this is of course keeping your pictures of ge@@ o data .
&amp; col@@ ore@@ dit ; is a editor for p@@ all@@ ets files . the application can be used to edit color palms and for selecting and using colors .
the p@@ all@@ ets files that are installed by &amp; k@@ de ; can be installed either for the entire system or only one user . in the latter case you are in your personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and pre@@ defined colors and last used colors .
in the dialog box , you can select from a list of installed p@@ all@@ ets or browse the folders according to files .
the cur@@ sor is displayed in the p@@ allet view as a line . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
it shows the color to it . color is described under the p@@ allet view . here , the color name can also be changed .
it can also be used to select such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cur@@ sor . afterwards , move the mouse with pressed left mouse button .
if the check box is inserted under the button color , the color is inserted into the cur@@ sor . this mode is either inserted or over@@ write a different ; depending on whether the mode is selected . this mode allows you to set over@@ writing the check box below the cur@@ sor .
a selection , which was created as described in the last section , can be used together with the actions of copying , cut and paste .
&amp; col@@ ore@@ dit ; uses the following format for data in the clip@@ board : for each color three values for the propor@@ tions of red , green and blue and an optional color name , followed by a line of lines , if there are three numerical values in the clip@@ board , these can be inserted as a color in &amp; col@@ ore@@ dit .
colours in the palette and the colour selection can be moved with the mouse .
select a color somewhere on the screen and then you can find in the color selection on the left .
&amp; k@@ graph viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; graphic programs are used in science , especially in computer science , especially in computer science , especially in computer science . so far , there was no modern &amp; GUI ; it contains , according to the program author , out@@ dated &amp; X11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with only a few functions .
the &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; project has set itself the goal to replace these programs by a modern and user @-@ friendly graphic interface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; k@@ graph viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; graphics are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; displays graph@@ s with all possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ block ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; Kate ; and &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; ( such a change in the graph in &amp; Kate ; graph@@ s newly calculated and illustrated in &amp; graphic viewer ; )
menu to open the graph in &amp; Kate ; open or open the graph to &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; in a &amp; Kate ; -@@ component
load big graph@@ s ( currently there are problems starting from about 1000 knots and one h@@ ack to display more than this node )
additional required software : &amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program which pre@@ sets the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tool &amp; dot ; for presentation of graph@@ s required . in detail , the following :
the main window displays the opened graph@@ s , each in a separate window . at the beginning , when you start &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; without a argument , the tool@@ bar contains only the symbol file and the ( empty ) list will open . click the first icon to view the dialog file .
after you have selected one or more &amp; dot ; files selected , the main window looks like in the lower screen picture :
as you can see , an overview in the corner is displayed , if the graph is larger than the drawing area . you can select a fixed position of this overview or select this position automatically .
use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special keys , left and right at pressed &amp; alt ; -@@ key ) ;
zoom is limited in both directions by a factor of 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graphic .
when the file in &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; loaded file has been modified by another program , the following window will be displayed :
you can choose whether the graph should be re@@ loaded or if you want to ignore the change . if you want to change the change . if you want to change your decision later , you can set up your decision later ; you can set up your choice later , see also .
if you open a graphic file outside of a running &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; instance open , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or at the command line , you have the choice if you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; instance open or want to display open graph@@ s in a sub@@ window of the already running instance .
as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but also with the setup dialog .
in the program start , you can open all the graph@@ s of your last session . again , you can save your choice as well as later .
you can also define how the graph should be divided on several sites . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be chosen freely .
if you are using multiple sites , you can choose whether the parts of the graph@@ s are to be inserted on this page . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled out of each part of the graph .
look with one on several pages distributed graph@@ s without head@@ line and with another font
the page once again gives the option to specify the behaviour if a file has changed to disk , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( automatically re@@ load or ignore the changes ) or program each time .
the page opening is the possibility to specify the behaviour of &amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; if a graph will be opened outside a current session . you can open a default behavior inside a new window , or determine that every time is asked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the side of the sitting position gives the possibility to specify the starting act of &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; you can specify a standard behaviour ( the files of the last session or not ) or determine if they are asked to be asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the context menu , usually appears at a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; it opens further possibilities :
here you can choose from various &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; select layout algorithms . the entries , as described in the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; are :
&amp; dot ; algorithm , the Standard for directed graph@@ s . it produces hier@@ arch@@ ical or dist@@ orted represent@@ ations of framed graph@@ s . the algorithm puts the edges into the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges and as few can@@ te@@ ers as possible .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for un@@ regulated graph@@ s . it produces depic@@ tions according to the bo@@ oting model . in doing so , the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is syn@@ onymous with statistical multi@@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorithm created for un@@ regulated or a spring@@ time model layout . it uses the fru@@ str@@ man net gold he@@ ur@@ istik , and includes a multi @-@ se@@ ver for the treatment of big and clu@@ ster@@ ed graph@@ s .
the &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm calcul@@ ates the no@@ des in a circular according to the description of Six und Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and meadow , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of several cycli@@ c structures .
open a dialog where you can specify a layout command , which will be executed by a shell command , and the calculated layout of the graphics after st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . with such a layout command you can specify &amp; graph@@ it ; displays special options , or modify the graph@@ s with a filter before it is drawn .
determines the type of graph@@ s ( directed or un@@ coated ) and applies the standard algorithm for each type ( dot ; for directed , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for appropriate graph@@ s ) .
if this setting is enabled , the overview is displayed if this is necessary . otherwise it is not displayed and the positioning menu is in@@ active .
displays what is the mouse cur@@ sor . click with this mouse cur@@ sor on a &amp; GUI ; element to get further help to this element ( if available ) .
a list of changes is available at this address and in the file Ch@@ angel@@ og in the base folder of the source archive .

the K@@ IP@@ I module for ge@@ ographic loc@@ alization allows GPS coordinates to add and process the ge@@ ographic data are stored in the EX@@ IF data of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for ge@@ ographic loc@@ alization is available to loc@@ alise images of geograph@@ ically in the spher@@ ical coordin@@ ate system , which is used by GPS and Galileo . height , length and lat@@ itude are used .
in order to cor@@ relate your pictures with ge@@ ographic data , you need a GPS track as an XML file in the GP@@ X format . g@@ p@@ sb@@ abel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
Bild Ge@@ ograph@@ ical loc@@ alization Cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can bring a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
select the images you want to cor@@ relate to the main window and call the menu on . the above @-@ to @-@ see dialog appears . of course , you need to load a file file with GP@@ X file . this file , of course , contains data at the same time , like the pictures of your camera .
when the file is loaded an automatic cor@@ relation , the coordinates is performed in red . GPS trace data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera @-@ time has to be converted to GMT . this can be done with time zone . click here your camera zone .
the adjustment for the maximum time devi@@ ation is the maximum devi@@ ation for the GPS time and camera @-@ time . lies the devi@@ ation below , the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you do not have trace data from a place for pictures you can edit the GP@@ X file manually and add to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will be cor@@ related all images in this area .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ishing and difference in minutes can be used if you don &apos;t have any suitable data . if you know that in reality a location in a big time difference between camera and GPS is , you can set these boundaries here and then press the button cor@@ related to inter@@ pol@@ ate .
the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful when you have made a number of photos on the same place . since the dialog you will need to use the coordinates of a call to the next , you just need to use the button OK to set the data with the current photo .
the location can also be found and set with the shown map and increase it . select this to the respective region and increase it again . the height must always be manually chosen . the card can always be manually selected . the card can be switched between card mode , satellite photo and a mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are ways to hang the GPS data to the images . here is a small script that the ex@@ if@@ tool uses to have a stack of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I Module gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums in a picture gallery from HTML pages . you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is encoded using UTF @-@ 8 , to provide the best possible internation@@ alization .
the module has four riders in which the settings can be customized according to the tab . you need to select all albums that will be exported to HTML . you need to quickly select this albums . in the area below , you will quickly find a large number of albums . in the section below , the Al@@ ben@@ ds and the text that appear in the header of the HTML page will appear .
the rider appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each side . this tab has been created largely by itself . if you click on a picture a new page is displayed in which the image is displayed . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your standard viewer , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ show , displayed
the tab album defines the settings where and how the gallery will be stored with all your related images . a sub@@ folder with the name K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export , which contains everything , will be created there .
if you select the JPEG file format , EX@@ IF data of your original pictures are also stored in the new images .
with other color depth , you can change the standard color depth . it also influences the file size . all other settings are in@@ explic@@ able .
the rider shows you some of the settings from the album tab for thumb@@ nails , those are small pictures shown in the gallery .
a progress window displays the user to how far the action is . press off to break the process .
when the module produces the sides the window will not be closed automatically . you can therefore read the programs to see if errors occur during the creation . the web browser will automatically start to preview the gallery . press close to the module .

the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG los@@ s@@ free module is a tool to change images without aff@@ ecting your quality .
this module allows you to save images in JPEG format , without the usual losses of quality or metadata .
the consequence of the los@@ s@@ less storage is that the file size increases , because no compression of the colour information is taking place . this can be found , e.g. at P@@ NG format .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client is a tool that allows you to connect your computer with a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client is currently no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I Team among k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. please note : the participants in this list speak English .

the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in form of a Di@@ asch@@ au .
the MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG @-@ Video , with a defined length to convert . this module uses the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick . you can also add an audio file to the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the Di@@ asch@@ au .
all images will be sc@@ aled automatically to the correct size for the selected video format . additionally , you can create a background color for the selected video format . with this module it is possible to create DVD / X@@ VCD / SV@@ CD / VCD for your DVD player . finally , you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
you must first select the images that will be packed into the MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au . afterwards , you can launch the module via Extras MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au .
the images selected by you will then be shown in the portfolio under image files . there you can also change sorting the images or the contents of the list .
after you &apos;re satisfied with your list , you should change the other settings . if you are brows@@ ing the file on a TV , you have to select the corresponding TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NTSC . PAL is pre@@ set and most likely the right choice for Europe .
in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds that will be displayed in seconds . a low value produces very sudden , a high contrast very smooth image changes .
the background color can be set next . in doubt , you should leave them black . you can set the name and path of the generated file under Name of the MPEG @-@ output file . if possible , keep the extension .
in case you specify an audio file under name of the audio source file , you can start creating the production of the movie . depending on your computer , you can go to the production of your computer . depending on your computer , you can go drinking a coffee and enjoy the Di@@ asch@@ au when you are back .
if a hint appears that Ko@@ di@@ erer or tools are missing , so you can adapt the paths to the programs of M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick Pack@@ ages to the right below .
the printer wiz@@ ard allows you to print multiple images on one sheet of paper together in standard phot@@ ovoltai@@ c . the combined images can also automatically be used with the image processing Gimp . this is e.@@ g : useful to improve you or using the Gimp module for direct expression .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import or convert your images stored in RA@@ W format to one of three formats JPEG , TIFF or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command line tool d@@ cra@@ w from Dave Coff@@ in . a original quote from Him is : expect the same results as the software from your camera team . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w better results ! .
first , select the RA@@ W file to be converted and start the module . the Ra@@ w image Converter window will then appear in mode for a single image . with the button preview , you can view the effect of your current settings .
you can now adjust the values to optim@@ ise the conversion process . the first option decides to adjust the camera settings like gamma , brightness and red / blue amplifier . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the image later .
a four @-@ colour R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ GB@@ G switch has no effect .
once you &apos;re satisfied with the preview , you can save one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the fil@@ en@@ ame remains the same and only the expansion will be adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a fun@@ ni@@ ated algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes .
tagged image format , TIFF , re@@ tains all the information of your image and uses the los@@ s@@ free L@@ Z@@ W compression .
if you prefer to edit your pictures often or later , you should not use the JPEG format , as there is only a limited number of operations before image quality deteri@@ or@@ ates . TIFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you select JPEG as a memory format , the metadata is stored in the RA@@ W file in the JPEG file in the EX@@ IF information .
if you have adapted your settings , you can start the conversion button . if you want to cancel this process , then you can use Canc@@ el .
the pile processing mode allows you to convert different images to one time . therefore , use this mode if you are safe , for instance by testing in a single picture , which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to the version for individual images . however , you have the possibility to automatically over@@ write the file . this is helpful if it is not available in an earlier test . however , a preview is not available as far the conversion has been advanced .
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in an album . it convert the program convert from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used for ren@@ aming all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the starting number and time@@ stamp of the album .
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images of a picture collection . it is used to make the convert program from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can make the image shr@@ ink or enlarge . four types of image change are provided :
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in dimension . width or height of the image is automatically selected , depending on image orientation , the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . this option remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adapt your picture to the screen format .
not proportional : proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed at this option .
printing preparations : prepare the image for the photo print . the user can set the print resolution and the size of phot@@ op@@ ap@@ iers . the target image , with background size , border size and background colour , will be adjusted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images with your preferred E @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the added pictures before . more pictures can draw on the list of these images and lay there .
after which you started the module , the images window with the selected images will be displayed . you can add more images via the button to add to a file selection dialog . for the last chosen picture , a preview of the right page is displayed .
you can also draw pictures to the picture list and add them to the list of the pic@@ tor@@ ial images .
with the button images you will remove the selected images from the list of the pic@@ tor@@ ial images .
after you selected all images , you can open the new message window of your e @-@ mail client with the button OK . you just have to add the addresses and the subject . the images selected by you are attached as App@@ endi@@ x .
do not check out too many pictures at once . most e @-@ mail accounts have limitations for the size of e @-@ mails . it is possibly a good idea to send several emails when you want to send a lot of pictures .
the e @-@ mail window will be used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is stored and used every time until you change them .
select your e @-@ mail clients from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you have to specify the right path for your installation .
if you use the Google Mail service , you must install the G@@ mail agent on your computer before . you can download it here .
after the selection of comments in a attached file , the comments on the images are joined to a text file and the mail is resolved .
the P@@ NG format under the menu image file format is not very suitable to use the size of photo files , but it is best adapted among the los@@ s@@ less formats like TIFF . you should therefore have to use P@@ NG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise , we recommend the JPEG format .
if you select JPEG under images file format and use the original files in JPEG format , then the original Ex@@ if@@ ications will be added to sens@@ ing images .
when the process is finished , the window will not be closed automatically , so that your e @-@ mail program will be started automatically , but your e @-@ mail program will automatically start at the end . with the button closing , you can sm@@ ite this window .
after starting the module advanced Di@@ asch@@ au , a window with questions like you want to view your slide show . you can choose between the albums selected and all pictures of the album .
the Open@@ GL @-@ trans@@ itions option in the presentation use very elegant photo outputs using Open@@ GL . however , you need to have a corresponding graph card since otherwise the slides will be very slow .
the fil@@ en@@ ames command ensures that the fil@@ en@@ ame of the images will be displayed in the lower left corner during the presentation .
the loop line ensures that the presentation is displayed in a loop loop . afterwards , you can manually inter@@ rupt it with Es@@ c .
the option images randomly select that the images are displayed in random order . so it will not be used in the order of images in the album .
with delay between the pictures , the time interval can be set between the individual images . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect . so you should watch this out before you show your friends !
there are more than a dozen trans@@ itional effects between which you can select . by chance you choose a different effect on every transition .
during the Sli@@ deshow you can access a tool@@ bar at the top left side of the screen . move the mouse to this corner to switch to you .
with this tool bar , you can start the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and next picture and stop the Sli@@ deshow .
at the left side of the screen you can see the current file name , the position of the current picture and the entire number of images in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date has now no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I Team among k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. please note : the participants in this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool to set a picture as a background image for the working surface .
this module requires the currently selected image , depending on the select option of the sub@@ menu , as the background for your K@@ DE working surface .
once you have signed your pictures and videos with remarks , you can see with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . by these brow@@ sen , see picture . as you can see by a comparison with the image , in persons , places and in group keywords .
in the browser window you will find the categories , for which you typ@@ ed your images and videos with notes . additionally , there are entries to look at EX@@ IF based information to view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course the current thumb@@ nails . in the following one is described for each other .
when you press the mouse on the entry , the browser will change . see picture .
if you want to select another person only the pictures are displayed , on which both persons are visible . by this selection method , you can limit the number of images displayed by a few thousand pictures on a few images .
if you have selected all the people , locations and other settings , you can view thumb@@ nails to view the images of your search area .
in the picture each person has the same icon in front of her name . they can store with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , but of course for each person a separate picture @-@ picture , this is of course also for places , keywords and other categories that you have defined . see the image .
in order to view images next to the name , select the button that you need to set the view on the tool@@ bar . in the appearing context menu , you can select the view for each category separately . in the appearing context menu , you can indicate that you can display the icons with images from people and simultaneously a list of keywords ( if you don &apos;t have any suitable images ) .
you must decide , however , to select which image is displayed for each individual person . in order to view this , you need to select the image editor , as shown in the picture . in the context menu , you can custom@@ ize the image for the appropriate person . in the An@@ si@@ fication window , you can select the magni@@ fication factor according to your wishes , which should be displayed and cut off .
if you want to locate the entry in the main window , a dialogue will be displayed , which is very similar to the dialog for finding the image properties . this dialog can take you on the picture again .
if you want to enter a string into the field label or description , you can also enter a date or descriptions of the images to search for ; the date can be either a part of the total date , i.e. 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the lower part of the window , you can browse all the pictures according to certain names , as you can see in the picture , on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene are depicted .
this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; . if you don &apos;t like to read manu@@ als but prefer to try out functions , you have the following alternatives to this hand@@ book :
go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , and check out the quick entry , screen photos and introduc@@ tory videos .
start &amp; start photo@@ album in the first dialog , if you start &amp; start photo@@ album ; for the first time , or choose the menu entry k@@ photo@@ album ; -@@ demo . thereafter , some sample images will be loaded and you can try out the features of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; try it out .
if you prefer to print this hand@@ book , you &apos;ll find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a connected HTML document to download .
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this strip you can see here : how the name already says , this bar will show you data statistics about the pictures in your database .
the tim@@ eline can display several different time units . every body shows a different unit . you can switch between the units , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing the bar only 10 @-@ minute sections .
the tim@@ eline can be viewed in the following ways : you can change the displayed preview view from the database ( if you select a Date in the preview pane ) and also displays the time@@ bar the current date of the currently displayed pictures , if you navigate in the preview pane .

&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; provides you with two options available to create HTML websites with your pictures ; integrated and the other as a module is available ( see ) . in the following part of the user manual , the integrated version is described in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version , which you can create via the HTML menu ...
before HTML pages you need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas of content , layout and purpose . in the following , each section is described in more detail .
first , enter the title of the review and a description , which should contain the HTML file later . on a photo@@ album ; HTML example pages you see an example of this settings .
next , choose whether a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album can be created ; the export file is to be seen on the reviews page . more information about export files can be found in .
last@@ ly , you can select which information to be displayed on the HTML pages . for example , you can see that information is displayed without description . for example , all pictures are displayed . you can &apos;t use this setting to hide specific images from certain amount .
in this area , you can specify how the HTML pages should look like . most options are clear why not specifically made .
at the bottom of the page you can view different resolutions for the images . thus , those you have to consider your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution of 800x@@ 600 , no images that have a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewer &apos;s viewer can change the resolution at any time you have defined . it can , therefore , search your images with low resolution , leading to a lower transmission time , if he wants to get a larger image , it changes to higher resolution .
in this setup area , place the different folders and the URL where your website is stored .
best select for all your HTML files a base folder and for each subsequent set a new sub@@ folder .
first you need to select the main folder where all your images will be saved . this folder will be stored and next time you can select the location . here you can select either a folder or a K@@ DE support protocol , for example :
after you have created your pictures , you can check if these really are all visible to the viewer . if you choose a URL , a web browser has been created . the URL where you can set up here should be this folder . otherwise the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if you don &apos;t need to manually copy the HTML files in the final destination folder , you need to manually copy them to the final destination . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the basic folder in which all sub@@ folders there are .
the options described above have referred to all three in basic folders or URLs . in these , a sub@@ folder is created , whose name you define in the output folder .
if you &apos;re on a family party , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . you can , of course , want to add a HTML page to viewing the images . you can , of course , take a HTML page for viewing the pictures , then you &apos;ll have to take up with &amp; kiss album , then do not have to do this work once again .
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your pictures into a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others to your database . the image characteristics are imported with ex@@ - and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in the file only if the images are stored in the file or if you can store all the images into the file , so that you can download all the images and pass this file so independently . however , the obvious down@@ side is the file size .
you can either export a .@@ k@@ im file directly from the File File &gt; or along with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file together with a HTML file , this will create an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the images in two times . at first you go through the images that you have entered in the .@@ k@@ im file . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using HTML export .
below is the dialog for exp@@ orting images , which you can export to the Export menu ...
the most important option of this dialog is to act on internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three choices are available :
for the Manu@@ ally to the .@@ k@@ im file , you must copy the images in the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
with the option Autom@@ atically copy the .@@ k@@ im file copying &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the pictures automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zip files . since most images have already been compressed with JPEG , it is normally not worth to comp@@ ress the files . if you wish to comp@@ ress this , simply select the Export File .
the last option of this page is maximum image size limit . if you want to send your friends images , the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very large . here , you can limit the size , by example , that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and broad .
when you import a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu file Import ... select &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in .
the assistant for import@@ ing consists of four steps . first you need to select which images you want to import , after that , in which folder the import images should be copied .
it may be that you are interested in the category persons of the imported file ( if you are a Dan@@ e ) , while this category is called for your database . therefore , you will be asked in the third dial@@ ect , which categories that are imported into your database .
in the fourth step you can compare the categories of the import file with the categories of your current database . an example of this is shown in the picture .
it must be easy to browse pictures and watch : when looking at pictures , you often want to see images of your Italy vacation , and if you look for example images of your Italy vacation , you may want to see a picture of your friend on it , you may want to see all images on which this friend is depicted .
in this hand@@ book you will find the different steps from ( 1 ) to check out the information about your images , via ( 2 ) searching and pre@@ stige , up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and adjustment possibilities .
K@@ Photo@@ Album was started as a program to manage your pictures . however , it has been extended and today your videos are taking place . many places in this hand@@ book are spoken about images , but frequently it includes videos with one .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; store all his information in the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml in the top folder of your pictures . this is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice , e.g. Normal backup tools , copying to a disk@@ ette or re@@ visions in CVS , where you want .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; notice the folder where your pictures are stored and used this with future Star@@ ts automatically . if you want to read another folder in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , so you can start a different folder with images , so you can boot &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; using the -@@ c option . as example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
over the menu entry settings k@@ photo@@ album ; set up ... enter a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . in the following section of the user manual , you will be explained the different settings .
on the left you can see six different symbols , with which you can call Settings and options for the viewer . for each setting a detailed help is available , which can be retri@@ eved by button@@ ing to the F1 key and click on the desired option .
in you , as you can set for each image different properties , e.g. persons , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups such as items , animals or albums .
you can see the dialog that is used to process existing groups . for each available group you can choose a label and a symbol .
in the sub@@ categories , sub@@ categories have already been mentioned . in the dialog box , you can set up complete members of members , i.e. all members of a group at once in a group instead of all groups of an association as described in .
in view of the options available to the fixed list of members , you can select the category which you want to configure . in the left side of the list , you can select a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories .
&amp; photo@@ album ; shares his module system with other graphics applications , such as digi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this mod@@ ulation system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; image plug@@ in interface . more information can be found on the Ki@@ pi homepage .
the modules can be accessed through the module modules , since they are not described in this manual , as they are not part of &amp; c@@ photo@@ album . however , most modules have a help page , which you can call through the module itself .
since the modules of several applications are used together together , it may be possible to test the modules with &amp; photo@@ album ; this is why you should always call up new modules with the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album -@@ demo &lt; user@@ input \ &gt; or via the Help menu . don &apos;t say , I wouldn &apos;t have warned you !
the applications that use the modules over K@@ IP@@ I can be very different , making it possible that some modules with &amp; photo@@ album are not working . this is the dis@@ advantage if you share functions with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; c@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications , who also can use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications are not supported in albums . even though &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , this kind of order is not supported , so you sim@@ ulate the order for several modules , so that you can use the features of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album .
here &apos;s sim@@ ulated &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album , which just corresponds to the current view , so see all images that show you the picture preview right now .
in addition to the current album , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , the modules also has to pass a list of albums . here &apos;s a photo@@ album , as follows :
if &amp; photo album ; s browser showing the contents of a category , for example all persons , then each entry in this category represents an album for the module .
or it will be the category that you have defined in the settings dialog as a category for virtual albums , for example , if you are interested in the category individuals , so do if you have selected people to view and pass the module .
since some modules with &amp; photo@@ album are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . start the settings dialog , and select the module that modules are to be loaded .
on the picture you can see an example of a starting screen when you start &amp; print a photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures .
as you are used by any other K@@ DE application , you can see the window on top of a menu and a tool bar . at the moment , you will find no more information about your images . in the section , we will find no more information about your images . in the section , we &apos;ll see you on this window , but now click on the pics here showing an overview of all existing pictures .
one of the main features of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to see each image with notes , where the image has been recorded , etc . you can use each image either individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time . if for example , images are shown on all images of Jes@@ per and all images taken in Copenhagen .
all these comments can be used for searching and brows@@ ing how you can read in the section . if you want to see this comment when you use the built @-@ in viewer .
in view three lists with a text box by setting persons , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; c@@ photo@@ album , as you can always use them again , when you enter information about your pictures .
the following idea is based on the shi@@ fts of images within the list : for example , if you have a family celebration , and on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 persons are shown , so that the used names are moved up , the persons can be found faster and assigned .
if you prefer a alphabetical list , please click on the icon for sorting by date .
if you have selected comments on each image , you might want to edit all the selected images and apply these images with notes . in this case , simply click on the images and back buttons that are under the thumb@@ nail to the top .
if you have several pictures , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to mark all these pictures and apply the menu item Sever@@ al entries at a time with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA . San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California .
in the picture , see a browser window that shows the USA as over@@ group . to show you that it is an over@@ group , a special symbol is displayed .
in the context menu of the menu dialogue it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over@@ - or Sub@@ category . in addition , you can also extract an entry into a category and place it in order to make this entry into a sub@@ category of this entry . see it in alphabetical order of your categories .
you can move the individual elements of the collection dial@@ ogs , press and move the bottom edge of the frame , click and post@@ p@@ one . you can also make a separate window by taking it outside the window area .
if you have adapted the look of the window so to your needs , you are satisfied with the settings , click the button options ... , which allows you to save the current layout and the look of the window .
you can also leave a frame completely . if you want to see this window again later , use the button options ... and then click window to / out . see this procedure in the picture .
if you select the entry images in your browser , you will get an overview of the thumb@@ nails of the currently selected images , or all the images you don &apos;t have a filter . for example , you can see the size of the thumb@@ nails , by simply pointing out the mouse with the middle mouse button , configure . try it simply .
if you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this image will be set as background image for your desktop .
once you click on a picture , this is displayed in the picture viewer . if you have no window opened with an image viewer , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete images in the imag@@ ery show . simply select the appropriate pictures you want to delete and press in menu Edit menu . now , you will be able to select the window that you can see in the picture .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; it offers you a solution for this problem . you can also use them on your hard disk , so you have to record the pictures somewhere , thus &amp; the photo@@ album . in the picture you can see the picture of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . in the picture you can see the picture of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . in the picture you can download all the required images from the hard disk .
pictures where the right upper corner is cut , are not stored on the hard disk . this is , for example , to see the pictures 1 @-@ 9 . for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 , however , the thumb@@ nails are available , giving you the preview of these images . you can also watch these images with the picture viewer .
as you can see this feature , you need to copy files out of folders and avoid copying them again . if you don &apos;t want to avoid h@@ itting file sharing of your pictures , please buy a larger hard drive to store all images on it .
in the menu images you will find a sub @-@ menu with your name privacy . if you want to stay a little more privacy , you can check out the images that you want to see for other in@@ accessible and click on current view@@ points in the menu privacy . alternatively , you can also lock all the pictures you want to lock and lock the menu .
this way , you have defined what pictures can be hidden in case of the case . if you want to insert the laptop with your little sister , simply select the menu entry . if you want to see the pictures , click on lock .
it is also possible to specify a password which must be entered to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply select password in your privacy menu .
please remember that this image protection is by no means very safe . you can find out all the images on the hard disk and the others can read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text , for those who are able to stay on the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml ; it is not very familiar to the view on private images .
the reason why you can manage all of your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can manage and spend hours over hours , of course , that you want to look at them sometime . from this reason &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . from this reason has a picture _ and video viewer . you can preview it from the preview as described in .
the viewer can see in . of course it shows the picture , but additional all information you can enter about the picture , such as who is made on the picture , when and where was it done , etc .
if you want to see the Info@@ Box on the upper part of the picture , you can simply drag and get somewhere else . you can also configure the information displayed and whether all these options are available after a right click on the viewer . then you can see the upcoming Con@@ text menu below .
some words in the Info@@ Box are under@@ lined . if you click here , the browser is displayed . if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser will show you all the pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you select individuals from your browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have loaded more pictures on the viewer , you can switch between them and return by clicking the buttons below and jump down . you can reach the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and end . these functions can also be reached from the context menu .
if several pictures are loaded in the viewer , you can run them as a slide show . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; then invites you to make a new image after a few seconds . how frequently it can be controlled by pressing the C@@ trl key and plus or minus . started and stopped by the buttons C@@ trl ; S .
a very useful ability to change &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; it is used in full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the entire place on screen . just use the input key to switch to full screen mode and back .
when you use the viewer you can get in the picture and get out into the picture . with the Min@@ us button you can r@@ ash the Plus button zo@@ om@@ t into the middle of the picture . shows how a zoom box is marked and displays the result of the zo@@ oms .
with the dot key you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not drawn zo@@ omed . with the right mouse the zo@@ oms , so that every pixel corresponds to a pixel image of the image .
note that the only zo@@ om@@ oper@@ ations work for videos that are in and out with the plus and minus .
with the rotation functions from the context menu , you can turn the picture . this does not work with videos . you can make remarks on the current picture with the menu item notes from the context menu .
if you look at pictures , you can find a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten on the picture . in the moment you can view the view and give the configuration dialog of the picture , in order to mark those names . but they may prefer to mark the image and look at other pictures .
another situation is that you want to send a number of pictures to a printer to see the pictures on paper . to see what photos you want , you can start the viewer with the pictures and select them as good or bad , while you &apos;re one after another .
for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the opportunity to view images with features , while you &apos;re looking at them . features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature that you can press the corresponding letter . in you see an image where the features A , B and C are set .
once you have set features on your pictures , these are available in your browser . so you can see all the pictures you edit , print or whatever you have chosen , so you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD , or whatever you want to do .
categories and special features can be displayed in the preview screen . if you are looking for categories in DR@@ E Vor@@ schau@@ view , then you can add features to the images , simply press the characters for the feature when the image has been selected . this can be seen here :
sometimes it &apos;s not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case allows you &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; to paint on the picture .
the painted old is not stored with the image , but in the database . to the type you can und@@ o the mixture later .
in fact , you can see a picture depicted on the painting by &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . to turn on , select On the picture paint from the context menu . in order to finish the painting , simply press the cross in the tool@@ bar at the top of the window .
to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you must not rule the application of the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; but the documentation about &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; should you absolutely be read and understood .
in the object tree , you can select individual objects . then , their properties are displayed in the object properties and displayed in the wire @-@ frame views yellow .
you can also select several objects at the same time . but not the object of an already chosen object , as all subjects have already been chosen with the object .
to add a new object to the object tree , select the place where you want to insert the object and select either the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu entry in the menu .
if there are possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu will be displayed , so you can select the correct position :
with delete either from the menu bar under Edit or from the context menu of the right mouse button , you can remove selected objects from the scene .
if you have changed properties , click on User to take these changes . if you have invalid values , you will correct a message with a error description . then you can click the input errors or reject the changes with dis@@ rup@@ ting .
when you enter the path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; enter user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object .
you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation .
if you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can see a preview in the pec@@ uli@@ arity view .
press preview in the pec@@ uli@@ arity view and a small example of the scene is given to the selected texture . if you want to render the whole texture , even if you want to ren@@ ame a texture inside a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , check locally .
the screen picture shows the control points of the camera . you can move these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is selected , the control points and it will display a small cross in the wire model view . this cross marked the center for sc@@ aling and rotation and the position for shi@@ fts . you can change the shift through pulling using the mouse inside the entire window .
each object has an open level as a wire model . you can specify this value relatively to the visible level of the parent object or as absolute value . objects will only be displayed if selected or their visibility level smaller or equal to the tool@@ bar of the scene .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and view of the object features are displayed left and the four graphical views on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the standard window order , or if you need a different order , you can also save them anywhere . you can also store several windows orders and simply change between different orders .
to anchor a window over or below a view@@ point , drag the beginner to the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle indicates the new position .
to generate a new column , drag the beginner to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then ancho@@ red on the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height .
if you want to arrange multiple views on each other , drag the beginner to another view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the map tab above in the views .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the last possible window requirements are pending views : views that are not embedded in the main window . to solve a view from the anch@@ oring , drag the beginner on the desktop , or click on the small left pointing arrow at the top left . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to close a view click on the little cross in the Anf@@ al bar . to prevent the closing , click on the small square between arrow and cross .
you can insert additional views into the main window . in the menu view , you will find entries for any kind of views . new views are web@@ bing , you can anchor them on any location .
the current window view can save you with view window order ... storing it . it will display a dialog in which you can save the window order under an existing or new name .
if you have created a scene you can ren@@ dering it . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for ren@@ dering , this program has been installed properly . this version is not currently supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 is not supported .
to render the current scene , click the Ren@@ dering symbol Ren@@ dering the symbol Ren@@ dering in the tool@@ bar or select the menu entry mind scene .
a R@@ ender mode is equivalent to the entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s ini files . he determines the image size and quality of the ren@@ dering . if you want to ren@@ ame a scene in different sizes and quality levels , you can add any number of R@@ ender modes , from a quick preview up to perfection in the highest quality .
if you click on the tool@@ bar icon or in the menu view R@@ ender modes , select the following dialog :
each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name , but it makes sense to recognize the properties of the mode .
in the card box size you can enter the width and height of the packed image . if you want to ren@@ ounce only a small area of the image , select the check box section and enter the picture @-@ section to the input fields .
in combination with quality , you can select the properties that are used &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; for ren@@ dering , this is from a very simple colour and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user reflection lighting . a detailed description of the rig properties you can find in the user manual at &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; .
if a painting is rendered with only a beam of pixels , there can be different mistakes . these images are often not displayed in curves and lines , sometimes details are not displayed when a pixel are smaller than a pixel . this effect is called Ali@@ asing .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the influence of these errors . generally , images with this property are better .
when you switch anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and connect &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than a beam per pixel . this technique is super sampling .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super sampling . as a standard is an adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; recur@@ sively because each pixel is continually split@@ ted and adap@@ tive because each pixel depends on the calculated color values .
if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray pursu@@ es a beam of pixels with super sampling . if you calculate the depth of pixels with a fixed number of pixels with super sampling . if you calculate the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4x4 points will be calculated , with a low value of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then :
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference between the color value exceeds the pre@@ determined threshold , then the pixels is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels , which can be pursued separately and on further sub@@ division . you can adjust the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion .
another possibility to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is called J@@ itter@@ ing . if you turn J@@ itter@@ ing , change &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the rays have a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the final setting for the quality of ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; diff@@ use diff@@ use light @-@ fle@@ x@@ ion . it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this property .
on this map , you can set if the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent , if the associated rays have no object .
opens a new window for displaying &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ exp@@ ec@@ tedly , you can find the reason here .
to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; select the menu entry file Import ... and select a file in the dialog window .
currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; not yet the full command set of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; when import@@ ing error messages or war@@ nings , a dialog window displays a list of messages .
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; import , write this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ k@@ in and / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ End .
you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; this adds the source code to the property into the editor . to import objects into the scene , simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree .
with copying and paste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can add source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also paste .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; one scene is rendered . usually this is P@@ ov@@ ray or x @-@ P@@ ov@@ ray .
when you click on the Help window , opens &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation to the displayed object . set the path to your document projection and version . it supports versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example altitude data ) in the paths to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; libraries . if you enter files , you &apos;ll also need to enter the path to these files . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file is used .
color for wire models . the second color is used for display of selected objects .
color for control points . the second color is used for viewing the selected control points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the visible view in the camera view and in the window @-@ type symbols .
you can set the points of the points on the grid in the context menu of the wires model . you can set the grid separately for shi@@ fts , sc@@ aling and rot@@ ations .
larger values result in a precise wire model and thus a better result for the displayed objects , but require more time to ren@@ dering . for some objects such as the ball , you can set the detailed press for two directions separately .
when you cross high detail equipment for extended projec@@ tions , all wires are used . advanced projec@@ tions are all projec@@ tions with exceptions of perspective and the vertical projec@@ tions . this feature gives a better rap@@ proch@@ ement for projec@@ tions , but requires more time to ren@@ dering the projec@@ tions .
when you cross a wall , a wall is mounted behind the objects . the wall is displayed in a box pattern made of two adjustable colors .
when you cross the floor , a floor is framed below the objects . the floor is shown in a box pattern made of two adjustable colors .
if you tick the can@@ teen , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method for ren@@ dering the scenes is used . the values for depth and swelling can be set . precise information about parameters can be found in section R@@ ender modes .
on this page you can change existing window orders or create new window arrangements . in the section window direc@@ ts will be explained how to create and store window orders .
the drop down sel@@ ector field order : displays all existing window orders . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the chosen window arrangement at the start of the program .
the list of existing window orders shows all existing window orders . a new arrangement you can create with the button add and delete a selected alignment using the button .
each window arrangement is identified by name . the name must be clear and must not be empty .
the list below shows all views of the selected window arrangement . new views can create with the button Ad@@ ding and delete selected views with the button .
the new window &apos;s position . with New column , you create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with locks , set the window under the existing window , with the previous view and show@@ c@@ ate the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you have just worked &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you want to begin with no more precise knowledge of both programs . if you can open all steps in this tutorial , you should be able to create the ultimate , simple scene : one bul@@ let on one level .
but you should carefully consider following war@@ nings before you decide to make sure that you use a black screen as a result . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules :
if you do not set a camera , you can &apos;t use any rules for ren@@ dering , as a result you get a black image .
if you do not include any light sources , your whole scene is dark and you will only receive a black image .
if you have installed everything fla@@ wed , you can see at the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; following pre @-@ set window order :
take a little time to learn the menus and the available symbols of the tool bar . please read the documentation so that you can get an adequate idea of what you can expect from this program .
these menus and symbols will now often have to use , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you must first remove all objects from the object tree . then select the scene and select the menu entry to delete . so you have a scene without objects .
the wireless model view shows how the camera is considered the whole scene that you create . in particular , you notice that in the fourth wire model view ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the scene of the camera . this shows you the outcome of the scene .
the object tree now contains a new record with the name camera . if you click on it , see the content of view object properties where the different parameters of the camera are found . in user documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; you will find further details .
do not change anything in the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for later instructions , but note that the camera in the view control points can change with which you can change the focus of the camera . just click on a control point and drag it to the desired place .
when you press the button User or the input paste , the wire model views and the slide show instantly change these settings . as a result , they look at the scene from the point of view of the camera .
there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . you could insert a Qu@@ ader for example ( In@@ sert big body Qu@@ ader ) and the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a permanent method of solving this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; in fact a simpler way . you can use an infinite layer as bottom :
a good advice : choose the level in object tree , change the name and press the button User or the input paste . in the object tree the new name will be displayed immediately .
the wireless model view now indicates the level , even though at the moment only as a limited level . if you render the scene , the plane extends up to the horizon .
if you &apos;re looking to view the object tree , you will find that you &apos;ll find the different parameters of the object . in this case , you will see the different parameters of the object . in this case you will find only the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , turn and shift . select one of these options , also change the possible settings in the view of object properties .
in this scene you should move the ground to exercise a unit under the horizontal line , only to get to know some of these parameters . select shift and set the values as follows :
first , select the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but select slightly f@@ aches in the moment .
in both cases a dialog opens in which you can select as the object is to be inserted . please select the name in the object tree . you can preview the name in the pec@@ uli@@ ar view ( Name = bottom Pig@@ ment ) , with a click on the button preview , like the Pig@@ ment looks right now .
of course , you &apos;ll have to preview the pig@@ ments only a matt black material , because you can always check the pigment settings at any time with a click . now enter the colors for the pigment . also , there are many possibilities , but now take the easiest option .
if you look at the preview no color on Qu@@ ader &amp; Ball , click on the button users and then call the preview .
the material for the ground is right now . if you render your image now with a click on the symbol , you should get the following result :
of course this is not the color . you need to add two new attributes . in the color list , you need to select two new attributes . then edit this entry twice ( you can also do this more frequently , but the chess board colour list can only be used with two colors ) :
in each object tree , choose plain color and change the colors in the view of the object properties :
this step , you should already be able to use this step , as you have already understood the basic working mode of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the ball can be just as simple as the floor :
in the view of the object properties you can immediately change the settings . place the ball contact with the ground . otherwise , the ball contact the ground . otherwise , the ball would float above the ground , as you have shifted the ground to one unit .
of course , the ren@@ dering is a strange result : as already before , the ball surface appears like a matt black material . put in the following step a suitable material .
if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material to her . like at the bottom , give the ball a pigment than colour :
select the first sub@@ object and change the name for example in ball Pig@@ ment . click on Ball Pig@@ ment , then select insert and set the values as follows :
but you can achieve interesting effects if you take time to adjust some finish properties :
then change the values like in the following screen shots and click on application or press the input paste .
the settings shine @-@ effect and reflection already result in some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces , even if metal is still not selected :
you should now have a good impression of what offers you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; hopefully , you have already learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ cing is a R@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional picture of a three @-@ dimensional scene or model .
when you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ en a scene , the ren@@ derer &apos;s hyp@@ othe@@ tical rays derived from the view of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera that will reflect the scenes ) through the objects in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog will work . thus , the scene is edited for pixels .
as you can imagine , you will see nothing without a camera , the camera is your eye , with which you can see the scene . without a light source you can also see anything , the image is simple black . obviously , every scene needs to be dimin@@ ished , some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
open a file . in the default file dialog you can select a file that you have previously created using &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
whenever you open a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub@@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you have already saved the model , it is stored under the same name . if it is a new file , you have to enter a name and memory .
the scene is re@@ produced in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage are rejected .
this menu entry allows you to select only if you haven &apos;t stored any changes in the scene .
repeat the last update . this menu entry allows you to select only if you have editing feedback .
saves the current window system and opens up a dialog where you enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ write an existing arrangement .
in this menu , you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; here you can change the look , the button and the default behavior .
opens a dialog for changing the keyboard short@@ age . you can change or add a dialog for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er using this option .
open a dialog to set up tool@@ bars . you can add and remove the tool icons for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er with this option .
a b@@ ump @-@ map is a way to apply rough surfaces without model@@ ing any diff@@ ra@@ ction on the surface and without change the geomet@@ ric shape of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file both for a B@@ ump @-@ Map as well as for a texture map .
basic body are simple geomet@@ ric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models will be produced from dozens of or even hundreds of these basic body . these models will then be processed to give them a realistic appearance .
a texture @-@ map is a way to specify the surface of an object color on pixel basis by applying an image file as a color card .
&amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is a comfortable picture viewer and browser . the application has a file browser where you can select images for displaying .

&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is an application for scanning images that do not make more than scan and en@@ rich pictures .
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is an easy application to scan and save images , which do not do more than images . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; can store a dialog to save or save the images directly in a specified folder with automatically generated name and format . the user can display the images in front of the store as well .
you can check the status of your scanner on the san@@ e project page by entering the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ san@@ t@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .p@@ l .
a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; if this scanner is not opened , or if no standard scanner is specified , a dialog for selecting the scanner is opened .
the user can select the scanner and press OK to open the scanner . stop it off and exit .
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not treat these options .
in order to can@@ hold a picture , the user can start a Vor@@ sch@@ can and then scan the scanning range for the final scan . the preview can be started by preview button .
to select the image better , the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection . it can also adjust the zoom in the window .
if the image has been selected , the final image can be read by the Scan button .
if you select a preview window in the settings , then the image will be displayed in a preview window , as you see , then the image is stored and s@@ lie ? EN leads to a departure and you return to the main window .
by the button settings , the same named dialog is opened before the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
the user can view the image if desired , before saving . in this case , the option has to be selected a preview before storing . if this preview is not desired , the option must be selected .
this setting allows them to select the type as &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; pics to save for each image opens the dialog in front of each one @-@ sc@@ anned picture . if &amp; sc@@ an@@ l@@ ite , you will need to store it automatically with a generic name in a previously defined folder , then you must select saved without any fil@@ en@@ ame .
this setting defines where the images are stored in the option without asking for a fil@@ en@@ ame . if the images are stored after each scan , then this folder is used as default for the Save dialog . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button ... .
this parameter defines a picture pre@@ fix for the image automatically to save images and is beyond the proposed picture for the image in the dialog . the automatically stored picture gets a numer@@ ic Suff@@ ix of each time , when a picture is saved . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
the user can adapt the image quality to store . this value also changes the compression value when choosing . if select the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used .

you can possibly set up existing multimedia keys so that they work as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ Short@@ cuts work . this makes your keyboard to &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Control Center .
the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ o@@ ok has many general functions , which is mostly related to other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context @-@ browser , playlist , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , and scripts . a sample call for the D@@ CO@@ P function should look &amp; b ;
Amar@@ o@@ ok supports command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; in addition , Amar@@ o@@ ok has some own command @-@ line options .
you should give the user a feedback if the script is not executed due to a lack of dependence . please check in your script if all required modules are present and use dialog , so the user does not run why a script does not run .
start @-@ in &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ al@@ Er@@ ror error = &apos; cor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bind@@ ings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ bind@@ ings V@@ 3.4 is RE@@ QU@@ IRE@@ D for this script . &apos; &apos; dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; exit
in the scripts / templates you can find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use it as a base for your own scripts or simply to expand the required functions . you will quickly find that the writing of scripts is relatively simple .
with the help of D@@ CO@@ P you can exchange your scripts with Amar@@ o@@ ok and Amar@@ o@@ ok . the sim@@ pl@@ est way is to use the command d@@ co@@ p ; which should include every K@@ DE installation .
most scrip@@ ting languages allow external programs and commands . in this manner , d@@ co@@ p &gt; is mostly used . this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here is an example in Python :
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends not@@ if@@ ications to all running scripts . for this reason , you will continuously monitor their standard input and respond accordingly to events . of course , a script should ignore the events if there is no use .
configure We@@ is the script to display the setup dialog . in order to store and load the setup data , each script must be started . whenever a script is started , Amar@@ o@@ yst@@ ok sets the working folder to the folder where all data should be stored .
track@@ Change sign@@ alizes , that a new piece is played . the script could now query &amp; b ; with D@@ CO@@ P functions more information on the new piece ( for example , metadata or unit length ) .
volume change new@@ volume signals a change in volume . the new volume is an integer factor between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le , Gi@@ ves the Path to the selected files of the playlist , if a user @-@ defined menu entry can be found . to remove an entry , you can use the D@@ CO@@ P function d@@ co@@ p am@@ ok script file d@@ co@@ p am@@ ok script remo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ tit@@ le ) .
before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; stop , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SIG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed , e.g. upgra@@ ding of data or configuration settings .
am@@ o@@ ks script management can also install script packages , which can be downloaded from a web server . such pack@@ ets are basically normal T@@ ar @-@ archives ( .@@ tar ) , which can be optionally available with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ tar ) , which allows the user to clearly detect the archive as a Amar@@ o@@ ok script package .
&amp; Amar@@ o@@ yst@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the Advanced D@@ ob@@ server script . for this reason , you should ren@@ ame your script packages directly .
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to receive the file rights :
if your script package is finished , you can download it on www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and you can attach the link to the wi@@ ki scripts page from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; app@@ r . for your listing on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; scripts .

relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : if you activate this setting , use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist , otherwise the absolute position of the music files will be saved .
to keep up to the change of change , the play@@ lists window will keep up / off to keep the running piece in the visible window range .
when changing to the context @-@ browser , automatically displays the context @-@ browser as soon as the next piece is played .
in the App@@ ear@@ ance section you can custom@@ ize &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s appearance . the section is divided into three parts .
in the font section , you can select the use of different fonts in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; otherwise you can select fonts for the following area : playlist windows , Player windows and context browser . press on Select ... , so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog .
with selecting custom colour sch@@ ema you have the choice of choice and can set your own color scheme . use it to select the color selection for front and background colour .
playback on start continues , that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after the program start playback will continue with the piece on the spot , with which it has been stopped at last end .
the sub@@ window on @-@ screen display and allows you to switch on the O@@ SD card . if on @-@ screen display is displayed , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview .
the first option is the font . click Ex@@ elect ... to select the font named for the O@@ SD . the check box shadow causes the text in the O@@ SD .
&quot; &quot; &quot; your own colours gives you the option to select the O@@ SD colors for writing and background . clicking on the color areas opens the dialog for color selection . if suit@@ ably colors are not activated , the pre@@ set &amp; k@@ gs will be used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the input field display text provides the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering a wild@@ card , the O@@ SD can be adapted to your needs . below you find a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Display Screen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; screen is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users . thus , you can define , on which screen a multi @-@ monitor environment will appear on the O@@ SD . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the audio card audio output allows you to select an audio driver from the drop @-@ down sel@@ ector . some drivers enable additional options in this card card .
the card card collection is used for setting up all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and the type of database for the collection .
here you can select the folder , select &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to search for music files . in order to include a folder in the collection with its name , check the check box beside its name . this section also includes check boxes for entries , as with the selected folders .
browse sub@@ folders : this causes &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; both the in@@ cross and their sub@@ folders according to music is done .
changes : allows &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to monitor selected folders on changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . additionally , an incre@@ mental search will be carried out to make the necessary changes to your collection .
play@@ lists : bring that &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; all found play@@ lists in your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ s- and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) added to your collection . then , the automatically added playlist will appear later in the playlist browser .
the part collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the combination panel driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or MySQL . if MySQL is selected , there is another device in the sub@@ window to MySQL .
the MySQL database is used to set up the database for &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; on which the computer is set , on which the MySQL database is entered , under which the database is achie@@ vable under which the database is att@@ ain@@ able . name : is the database name to which the connection is made .
use user name : and password : to specify the data you need for the connection to the database .
the card last@@ .@@ f@@ m uses the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations regarding the current piece .
here you enter your username and password for your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you don &apos;t have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
send pieces and thus update the profile : this setting allows it &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
similar interpre@@ ts : after activ@@ ating this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a list with similar interpre@@ ters shall be retri@@ eved in the context . note : you can &apos;t use the list in the context @-@ browser . note : you don &apos;t need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this feature .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . further information can be found in summary of the functions and gallery with screen shots .
Amar@@ ok only needs the k@@ deli@@ bs package and otherwise no other K@@ DE pack@@ ets . you must have k@@ deli@@ bs so installed ( including the programs contained , as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires some of them to find such modules or scripts ) . we have a small instructions on how to comp@@ ile k@@ deli@@ bs minimal .
some functions such as the O@@ SD are pres@@ umed that your window manager will operate the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org . we try to support Amar@@ o@@ ks on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t because they provide an excellent development environment .
probably one of your files get an error in the Tag@@ Li@@ b library for days . you can also post this error to the Tag@@ Li@@ b developer among bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also hang out the broken file that caused the crash . after that , you can delete the file and create the collection again .
most of all lies that Tag@@ lib when reading the Meta @-@ Infos from this file crashing : please report this error to the Tag@@ Li@@ b developers under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database , then try SQ@@ Lite . the support for it in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is something mature .
make sure everyone of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used to comp@@ ile libraries with the same comp@@ iler version . if e.g. &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with GCC 3.4 , Tag@@ Li@@ b , but with GCC 3.@@ 3.x was compiled , then this leads to down@@ fall when editing the Meta information .
if you use K@@ DE with art@@ s@@ d , then disable automatic switch off if in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or use at least not a value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ trace by e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail will automatically come to a crash ) . if it is an often occurring crash and you can send us a good back@@ trace , the error will be guaranteed .
this is because many program write data as UTF @-@ 8 in the met@@ a @-@ inf@@ os , but do not sign up as Unicode . the following Perl script fixes the problem .
# ! / us@@ r / bin / per@@ l die &quot; The file $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; does not exist &quot; &#91; $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ; use _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; error when writing the tags of $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; US $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F8 ) ;
this script requires the Perl @-@ Modul MP3 : : Mp@@ lib . it can be installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ CP@@ AN -@@ e &apos;@@ install MP3 : : Mp@@ lib
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; s symbols in the status bar ( random playlist ) are always active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is an unknown mistake in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , you can fix the status down to grey and semi @-@ transparent . note that in some cases you have to click on a symbol until this setting shows its effect .
if you get this error : amar@@ an error : amar@@ an error : an un@@ defined icon : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map , then check if Amar@@ o@@ ok is the correct Q@@ t library . this can be viewed with ld@@ d &apos;@@ which amar@@ da@@ app &apos; _ BAR _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
in order to fix this error , you may need to remove any colored Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ o@@ ok will find the right version first .
there are some possibilities . most installation problems clari@@ fy the easiest by using an expert , your Uni@@ x@@ - or Linux distribution . you can also help with other users or in the developers . use the Forum and the IR@@ C among ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in the channel # Amar@@ ok .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please enter only one error if something is located at the end of a bug in Amar@@ ok itself .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; appears only an empty playlist . how do music pieces come in ?
this is simple . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files into the right part of the playlist .
to keep the surface intuitive , the start window is converted into the statist@@ ic window . you will find it under ex@@ tras .
the meaning of these symbols have changed with Amar@@ o@@ 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars are calculated for the assessment by the user , while the points are automatically calculated .
to evaluate pieces , you have to show the evaluation column in the playlist and select columns . click somewhere in the new application column , to specify the review rating for a piece . you can also use the Short@@ cut Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works when Amar@@ o@@ yst@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove , and then press release on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your selection and then select From playlist files from the drop @-@ down menu .
drag a playlist file with the mouse to the playlist and drop them down there , just as you would do it with other files . that &apos;s how simple it is : - )
in the tool@@ bar of the playlist , right next to the Add button , you can save the button playlist . click on it .
probably the program X@@ M@@ MS @-@ config file . install the X@@ M@@ MS dev@@ el package and install it &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . also look to lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ aliz@@ ations .
the Equalizer can be found in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . in addition , you can find it via the menu bar at ex@@ tras ....
no . yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses a back@@ end independent approach , therefore the real question must be supporting G@@ stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / N@@ MM / N@@ MM / N@@ MM / N@@ MM / N@@ MM / N@@ MM / N@@ MM / N@@ MM / N@@ DE@@ mm . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even support text and P@@ NG !
it may ! perhaps you can use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , which will not be supplied with a MP3 de@@ file ( for pat@@ ent@@ ary reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 @-@ de , input paste
start the Ya@@ ST online update and install the &apos; Multimedia option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does MP3 &apos;s work : - )
if you use the g@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa @-@ S@@ ink , the device must use a bl@@ ender . a mixer allows several applications to use the same time to use audio mixer ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or by the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( software mixer ) . check out the D@@ mix for AL@@ SA .
the output of this command should help you in search of the problem mur@@ m@@ .@@ and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer you might need to specify a different sink ( e. g. down ) .
the doing &amp; Amar@@ ok ; already . do not forget that media is to be deco@@ ded first . G@@ Stre@@ amer is the best choice if you are reading a decoder with little overhead . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ codes them and sends the PCM data to AL@@ SA . exactly like X@@ M@@ MS .
also X@@ M@@ MS de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can use directly to AL@@ SA , as well as x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optim@@ ise the settings of Arts . open Sound@@ server with highest possible priority ( authentic@@ ity level ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ sw@@ ra@@ pper SU@@ ID is set :
at K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x , there are problems with K@@ DE@@ Multimedia co@@ dec@@ s that can cause un@@ disturbed reproduction . read this error report . the size of the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA introduc@@ tory file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help well .
either you do not use the Arts driver , but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE @-@ Multimedia completely to get the faster Arts Co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
probably use the Arts driver . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver was optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buff@@ ers in the Control Center and Sound &amp; Multimedia , Sound System . the less the buffer , the less mot@@ ions respon@@ ding to the visu@@ alis@@ ations . yes , this is an error , please help us fix it .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed but if I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , crash@@ es &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; why ?
after the installation of G@@ Stre@@ amer you must register all the components . register G@@ ST @-@ register to record all G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help , you can also ask the IR@@ C channel # g@@ stre@@ amer .
try this ( get Amar@@ o@@ ok before ! ) : - Lo@@ ad open m@@ peg file , once as a system administrator , and once your normal user . then delete the module folders with G@@ ST @-@ config / g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ config command and run G@@ ST @-@ register again . now start &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
please report about bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. if you have a complete list of suggestions / wishes , send them the best to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ dev@@ el @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .

cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio files from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) . on the Internet , such programs are generally called ri@@ pper .
OGG Vor@@ bis : OGG Vor@@ bis is an entirely open , pat@@ ent@@ less and professional technology for audio data stream . OGG Vor@@ bis benefits from open source and stands in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by the O@@ gg Vor@@ bis Dec@@ oder@@ - and encoder modules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mad : this is a high quality MPEG @-@ Audio decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers of Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 Decoder module . &quot; &quot; &quot;
LA@@ ME : a well developed MP3 decoder , which can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial encoding . LA@@ ME is used by the MP3 Encoder module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source code for loss @-@ free audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio encoder module , so you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
Lib@@ sn@@ d@@ file , FF@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ h@@ ack Decoder : other libraries for processing of different audio formats . with FF@@ m@@ peg , it is possible for example to de@@ cryp@@ t WMA files to burn it to an audio CD burning .
SO@@ X : an aux@@ iliary program that can convert between different audio formats and convert . SO@@ X is used by the SO@@ X audio encoder module .
trans@@ code : a command line program for video editing . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
V@@ C@@ DI@@ mag@@ er : a fully equipped car system to edit , dis@@ assemble and analyze video CDs and super video CDs .
norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard level . for example , the different recording levels of the different albums can lead to the in@@ exhau@@ st@@ ive effect , which can be played differently .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to boot from CD and automatically playback all videos in the base folder of the CD .
this is a convenient method to re@@ load recently opened projects . the associated sub@@ menu provides a list of these projects . one click on entry opens the project .
saves the current project . if the project was already saved , the previously created file is over@@ written , otherwise it is asked for a new file name .
saves the current project under a new file name . K@@ DE &apos;s Dialog Save is displayed , with which you can select folder and fil@@ en@@ ame for the project file .
saves all open projects . this is the same as if you want to save for each single project file .
includes the current project . if a project is altered and not saved , ask &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; after what is going to happen . you can then break between Save and Chan@@ ges . you can also shut down and keep the project so open .
closes all open projects . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for each not stored project what will happen to happen , just as if you have logged into each project file .
closes all open projects and finishes &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; for every not stored project will be asked what should happen if you have called File Close .
if you call this entry , you can choose from the appearing dialog files to add to the project . if the current project is directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the added files will appear in the base folder of the CD .
&quot; &quot; &quot; open the dialog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; burning &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the current project . this dialog is basically the same as the Properties dialog of the Project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; K@@ 3@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; burning dialogue can only be opened if the project already contains data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
opens the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many projects related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are described by the right mouse button ( att@@ ain@@ able via the right mouse button ) .
this entry only appears on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it is useful when you &apos;re using files for a multi @-@ session CD . this is useful when you &apos;re using files for a multi @-@ session CD . it is useful for you to see the data from the previous session , so that you can see the existing files and folders for you .
this entry only appears on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function causes &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; to remove imported files from the current project . all other files do not remove any files from the medium , it just ends the previously imported files .
this allows you to copy the CD Copy dialog . this also allows you to copy a CD to another medium . alternatively , you can also use a copy of a CD which you can burn sometime later . you should also prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CD with defective sectors or video CDs .
open the DVD Copy dialog . this enables even without project file copying a DVD to another medium . alternatively , you can also get a copy of a DVD with the help of copying dialog . furthermore , the target medium has to be large enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source medi@@ ums in the original form .
opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW . thus , you can delete the entire content or parts of a CD @-@ RW disk .
open the dialog to form@@ atting a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , elimin@@ ating the contents completely deleted . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; lets you write the choice between the write modes and incre@@ ment@@ or .
burn a previously printed CD image . the dialog asks you to burn after an * .@@ iso , * .@@ rescue or * .@@ to@@ c file is currently not supported by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , but you have to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burn a previously created DVD image . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ iso file as data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button .
a previously printed DVD @-@ Video can be converted . this dialog window appears usually after reading a DVD in the summar@@ ies , but can also be used too . it contains information on the output video , code settings , and even options to modify the size and cut black edges .
displays information about the specified medium . this information is shown in the summar@@ ies and contain characteristics of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD .
displays a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; when an entry is crossed , the tool bar is currently visible in the main window .
when this is crossed , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not crossed , the status bar is hidden .
turn the folder view or off . the folder view is an overview of your folders and the CD / DVD drives . if the content view is enabled , their content is shown in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info , locks and unlock the drive .
the summar@@ ies switches or off . the summar@@ ies allows the selecting and drag of files into the project view . the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs unless a drive has been selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view .
switches the pil@@ low in the project view or off . the head@@ line is a narrow area , which is only visible when the project view has open projects . the head@@ line has no real function , it looks only pretty and separates the project view clearly from the remaining views .
this opens a dialog window to change key assign@@ ments for &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; after you select one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adapt the key to the key below .
this starts the K@@ 3@@ b ; setup assist@@ ants . thus , system administ@@ rators can be required to burn CDs and DVDs . therefore , system administ@@ rators will need to enter the password for system administ@@ rators ( root ) .
the settings of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b will open . virtually all functions of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b can be performed . almost all functions of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; should work properly . this dialog is intended to person@@ alize and to adjust the program .
&amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; is how many others &amp; k@@ kers ; applications are equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled via a shell script .
to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; to use functions , you can either use the command line program d@@ co@@ p , or something more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are decisive in functional scope , therefore your taste and type of your task is vital to which the bit@@ programs you apply .
in this chapter we will assume that you can use the command line program d@@ co@@ p . to make sure you need to make sure &amp; K@@ 3@@ b , you must make sure that &amp; K@@ 3@@ b is started . then give something like the following at the console :
in addition to the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions , which have all &amp; k@@ ens ; program in common , supports &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts , which are described below .
the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface from &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; features functions such as copy@@ CD , form@@ at@@ DVD and other functions for creating new projects .
D@@ COP@@ ref cre@@ ate@@ mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ ref cre@@ ate@@ mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ ref cre@@ ate@@ mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ ref cre@@ ate@@ mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ ref cre@@ ate@@ mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ v@@ d ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l ) void bur@@ n@@ d@@ v@@ d@@ image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method , you can create a D@@ CO@@ P reference on the newly created project : # K@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project via the # d@@ co@@ p K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b interface curr@@ ent@@ Project By using this reference is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Pro@@ jec@@ t@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the above @-@ listed K@@ 3@@ b@@ Pro@@ jec@@ t@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Pro@@ jec@@ t@@ Interface , which can only be applied to data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void cre@@ ate@@ folder ( Q@@ string name ) void cre@@ ate@@ fol@@ der ( string name , Q@@ string parent ) void p@@ string ( K@@ URL : : list URLs , Q@@ string parent ) void ren@@ ame@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ string path ) void ren@@ ame@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ string path , Q@@ string new@@ name ) void set@@ um@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ string id )
this makes it possible to fill out a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders and then adds files to the new folder :
# ! / bin / bas@@ h PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b interface cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ fol@@ d@@ bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT add@@ urine / home / tru@@ ce / some@@ fil@@ e.@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ be ; is an audio CD ; read @-@ out for &amp; k@@ de ; . with him you can easily read audio CD ; it can be read and installed in MP@@ 3- or OGG files . other formats are possible , depending on the encoder that is installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ rem ; is the interface of cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; data in WAV files on hard disk ) and of many co@@ di@@ ers that are encoded as default ( encoded files ) and FLA@@ C ( los@@ s@@ less compression ) . more codes can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first the tracks of the &amp; CD ; read and stored in WAV files on your computer ( loss @-@ free and compressed ) ; and then
are usually compressed in a second step of these WAV files ( usually one per title ) comp@@ resses in the MP@@ 3- or OGG format or other formats like the los@@ s@@ free FLA@@ C .
for the first step , read out the &amp; CD ; it is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ ars ; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this has not yet been installed , this must now be done .
for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ bis ( for OGG ) or other enco@@ ders have already been installed , so it is very likely not necessary to comp@@ ile something itself . but if FLA@@ C doesn &apos;t need to be used , its installation is not necessary .
what Ko@@ di@@ er@@ aser / File Format should be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction to coding , audio quality and compression factors .
a word to copy protected audio CD ; s : as already said , uses &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ z. with cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia for reading the audio data from the &amp; CD ; if not , it is possible to handle any copy of copying ; if not , it is possible to avoid any copy of copying ; even if not the mechanism of copying it is possible . avoid copying the copy of the copy protected audio CD ; s !
while setting up only once has to be done ( the setup dialog has to be found so often called up to a suitable configuration ) , after the daily use of a &amp; CD ; it will hopefully lead to understanding for the slim approach of the user interface , which will often be stum@@ bled at the beginning .
can convert many formats - depending which coding programs are installed ( MP3 , OGG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; get information from the Free@@ D@@ b from the Internet or can work completely without network , where everything is manually installed .
this is just a short list of the commands of the main window . in the next step , you will find further information such as this program is used as well as screen shots with descriptions of the program .
if the CD@@ DB is available on request , the CD@@ DB request will be available on request in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be locally or online , the latter case must first be connected to the Internet . )
start reading and - if an Encoder has been configured in the Code She@@ di@@ fication Settings section - the coding .
open a sub @-@ menu with a list of available encoder , so that the selection with another encoder can be read as the default . it is to be noted that before the Encoder has been configured in the Settings dialog , in the Settings dialog .
opens the file manager , allowing an already pending file to code , instead of a complete &amp; CD ; to read and en@@ code .
open the setup dialog for the type of not@@ if@@ ications ( as protocols , Pie@@ p@@ sen ) for programming ( such as reading the &amp; CD ; finished ) .
opens the main setup dialog of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cia ; with different card cards ( such as Encoder , for arran@@ ging the En@@ co@@ ders ) . here you have to go before the program can be used successfully !
this chapter describes audio quality , coding and compression rati@@ os and helps you with choosing the right body .
if no audio information is to be lost , a los@@ s@@ free audio format is needed . besides FLA@@ C there are also other like &apos; h@@ orts &apos; or &apos; Monkey &apos; which may be useful for this distribution . the cons are the low compression rati@@ os and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files .
among the audio formats , which can lose information by data comp@@ ress depending on their psycho@@ ac@@ ic model , MP3 and OGG files are much less important to MP3 in audio quality ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit rate the differences are less important as both of the enco@@ ders generate very good audio quality .
O &apos; not so free &apos; free , but nevertheless delivered with most distri@@ butions , but there are open license questions
+ high to very high sound quality ( with high bit@@ rates ) , but compared to OGG slightly lower quality with deeper Bit@@ rates .
OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer @-@ based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG tuning devices is present .
MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special auto stereo systems . today - at the beginning of 2009 - support these equipment mostly only the MP3 format .
a short list of parameters for audio quality and the resulting compression rati@@ os for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos; --@@ pre@@ set medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set standard &apos; = This setting should usually provide for most people and most musical pieces acceptable transparency , and has quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set Extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set Extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate approximately 5.5 . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR , stereo , compression rate , about 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a title . good enough enough for music by young people , portable devices and car parks . but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 320@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you want to have absolutely highest quality without consideration of the file size , then select this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information provided by the Free@@ D@@ b program automatically via the Internet , are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can transfer / needed with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ F ; and the code name to create file name and file names as well as the properties of music files .
in connection with code programs , there are frequently a combination of program settings for the Ko@@ di@@ erer and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ern explain the switch for these programs .
for example , to add the &amp; CD ; Tit@@ le to the keywords ( English : day ) , if MP3@@ s are encoded with l@@ ame , the switches -@@ tt of l@@ ame and the title parameters of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ ds must be added ; the result looks like : &quot; w@@ tt { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ on ; parameters that can be used ( = button title in the assistant ) :
this is what the Free@@ D@@ b is : a free database where you can download / enter the audio CDs instead of yourself to enter the computer instead of yourself into the machine . it is said to note that all other information is spoken instead of yourself to the machine : &amp; CD ; Tit@@ le , artist , name of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not by the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal but I ( An@@ c@@ m. of the operator ) is not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; and moreover , the information is not added to the CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music business can be hurt . all information can be obtained from a bo@@ mel by a &amp; CD ; shop , physical or virtu@@ ell .
in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ zone ; it is actively used to select a check box . for the use of Free@@ D@@ b you can use with another ( counter@@ feit ) address . in this type of configuration , it seems that the email address is not used by the server ( this can only know the programmer that has checked the code . )
there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ ars , used for use Free@@ D@@ b , the ge@@ ographic on the next door should be needed . this saves bandwidth in the network and re@@ sembles the load between the machines .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org gives a current list of mirror ser@@ ver@@ n for the online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; for information while reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the database updates .
what identification program is used to store pieces from the &amp; CD ; in WAV files on my computer ?
there is rum@@ ours that cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; who wants to know more precisely in the source code .... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD ; it has always been to be installed that the cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package has to be installed first if this is not done .
for saving the extinct WAV files , the Ko@@ di@@ erer can be selected and thus the desired file format . during the first opening , you are pre @-@ defined files for l@@ ame ( MP3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a loss @-@ free compression for audio data ) on the tab to set up the code . other enco@@ ders can be added on this tab .
the Ko@@ di@@ erer Package must be installed from the respective Linux distribution , before the enco@@ ders may be used . this is also necessary for the pre @-@ defined co@@ oper@@ atives . more information about Ko@@ di@@ erer can be found in the chapter Wel@@ der Ko@@ di@@ erer .
after installing a Ko@@ di@@ zer , more information about its switches can be obtained by entering a command like l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console ( eg ; Con@@ sole ) and must be replaced by the name of the installed code .
this can have many causes . check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the write and reading of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) are installed . try both programs with a command line in a terminal block . that could give a reference to what is wrong .
check if you do not want to read a copy protected audio CD ; check out the envelope of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
there is a chapter with one step for example . even if you use other settings , this can give you tips how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , everything understood , but are somehow still uns@@ ure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by step example , and you &apos;ll get enough information to establish those areas which make the program exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time , set up everything and read our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pre@@ set Extreme &apos; to generate MP3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) of 224 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 keywords ( tags ) .
there must be cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution , as it is considered not completely free software . anyway , it is not necessary to comp@@ ile the source files , whatever you can do .
please ensure that the directory / us@@ r / share / cd has and that you have write permission to write it ( eg ; by trying to copy it into something ) .
the first section covers basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ ds ; something is probably done only once and
the second section describes the procedure to read out a &amp; CD ; what must be repeated for each ex@@ iting &amp; CD ;
here we determine the used Ko@@ di@@ erer for compression of music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the resulting audio quality ( --@@ pre@@ set Extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 k@@ bps ) . since we are lazy , we share the program with running Free@@ D@@ b to download the &amp; CD ; download data from the internet .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change them when reading a &amp; CD at any time , if once the matching settings are found .
the device name is delivered to the readable program to read the &amp; CD ; data / pieces can be read .
often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your drive . if this can &apos;t work or if more than a &amp; CD ; / DVD drive can also be accessed with other programs , such a glance into the file / etc / f@@ rod and an attempt with the existing entries for the CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General Settings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tab . here there is not much to do . here , an additional conversion can be defined . in our example , everything is shown that is shown as shown in the screen picture . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only in@@ quire in full information so you will be informed when data are missing to the witness of keywords ( tags ) .
the ticket card CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and leave the &amp; CD ; data automatically via the Internet from a Free@@ D@@ b machine .
note : the machine must be connected to the Internet when reading &amp; CD ; it can be connected to the Free@@ D@@ b server .
the second selection field is easier , a &amp; CD will be found , when you &apos;re later un@@ happy with the database entry and the resulting directory names / fil@@ en@@ ames or tag records , they can easily be changed with kon@@ quer@@ or &gt; ren@@ aming the ID3 tags with Kid@@ 3 , dem &amp; k@@ de ;
apart from this example , if you want to manually enter the selection fields and Free@@ D@@ b is not used . you can choose to use Free@@ D@@ b locally in Off@@ line mode . however , this is about 620 MB large , you need to select the two selection fields , at least the first one . mode is set up on the following map .
CD@@ DB is for us Free@@ D@@ b . these are settings for the data request , for calling the Free@@ D@@ b server on the Internet . how do the system know which data should get the CD ? read the section through Free@@ D@@ b . put everything on how it is shown on the screen picture .
mode : we have not downloaded the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB @-@ Server : please go to the site of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look at a mirror server in your vicinity . on this way , the load is distributed between the machines . this setting will however work as the first attempt .
both work equivalent to the server , but because many fire@@ walls may boot up the protocol 88@@ 80 as default , there is perhaps more luck with the protocol 80 because the &amp; HTTP protocol is usually open to surf on the Internet .
in this example , we don &apos;t want to transmit data to the Free@@ D@@ b server . the first check box should be checked .
simply take the settings from screen image . ( make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer )
number of simultaneous pieces : sorry , there is a reason why more than one at the same time with only an existing drive ? parallel reading and code ? the author does not know , therefore just try .
CD ; after reading the last piece : cross it to the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process .
user @-@ defined folder for temporary files : if you are crossed this , then the path / folder can be specified , in which the WAV files is stored . this can not be displayed in the private folder . do not forget to make this folder when you want to do anything with the WAV files .
everything is as shown on the screen picture . the command is a bit long , under circumstances , something is going to be seen on the right to see everything .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set Extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of MP3@@ s . as previously mentioned , it is sufficient for a very good audio quality , even for very good hi @-@ fi stereo systems . the resulting bit@@ rate is about 224 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the reached compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption .
note the associated entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for the limitation of the creation of tags to version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags can be deleted from a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the complete path ) and output file ( including the complete path ) .
put the rest in the screen menu . some comments for future use outside this example :
number of simultaneously encoded WAV files : at a Du@@ al@@ Core or Quad@@ core or even a multi @-@ processor machine can be tried to en@@ code more than a WAV file at the same time .
this is what we have just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ . this configuration is used as a standard for every reading of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organis@@ ational structure of your music , you will never need to change them again .
this section is described as the process of reading the &amp; CD ; it is described in the previous section , as we want to set up MP3 files . first , a connection to the Internet is described , as we want to pick up the software and the CD ; data from the Free@@ D@@ b can be picked up . the process that is described in this section must be repeated for each sub@@ mitt@@ ing &amp; CD ; to be repeated .
as we use a &amp; CD , which is not yet included in Free@@ D@@ b , see screen shots a little different than the data for a &amp; CD ; therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; with successfully retri@@ eve it from the Internet , instead of retri@@ eve them from the internet . comments will point to the differences .
don &apos;t try to find the &amp; CD ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author this manual .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if this is not done yet , the &amp; CD now needs to be defined in the drive which is defined in the main window . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a short moment , the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as shown in screen photo . this only if the &amp; CD ; as audio CD , could be read and from cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia can be read .
if this does not happen , search in the Questions and Ans@@ wers after the Help or go back to previous section concerning the basic settings .
attention : if the &amp; CD ; successfully picked up from the Free@@ D@@ b , all titles of the pieces are already filled in and furthermore the name of the artist and the album are displayed .
for the case that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; there is a window that appears , and you can select the database entry , which your opinion is best on your &amp; CD ; fits .
if you have not selected the check box for the automatic query from Free@@ D@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for Settings ) , you can also manually release it by choosing the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t have local database , you will need the Internet to connect to the Internet .
e 1.2 step 02 : the CD editor - entering the CD data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen picture , enter the title of the piece in the first line of the &apos; Update &apos; , the rest of the data in the &apos; Album &apos; input field .
the artist must not be entered in an input field &apos; Current title &apos; unless you have a compilation with various artists for each piece .
the lower comment field can be used for the individual comments ini@@ di@@ cial per piece , the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply to all pieces of the CD .
caution : after the successful call of data from the Free@@ D@@ b is the CD editor not empty , but it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor , so that you are not only able to check out the contents of the CD editor ( for example if all words with upper@@ case letters start or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted remarks .
note : in this example , we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this is limited to the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album , and title of a piece . if you are using ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags , you have set up unlimited field length , at least on the code tab card settings ; take a look at the Settings section &apos; Basic Settings &apos; .
you can change the tag information of the generated files at any time with the tag editor . Kid@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with him you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
tags are not supported by any codes or file formats . see in the help of the Ko@@ di@@ erer to receive more information .
simply select an entry , which is obviously not important in this example , as we don &apos;t transmit the &amp; CD ; for more information go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or ra@@ p , for example , are found under rock .
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; you come back to the main window . just click on the line with the second piece .
the CD editor &apos;s window appears and you &apos;ll see that the fields are already filled with the given data , which we have recorded for the first piece . simply type the entries for the first piece . enter the title of the piece in any case and other information you wish .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD ;
attention : this window doesn &apos;t appear when you have downloaded the data from the Free@@ D@@ b . it is already sorted in one of the categories in the database .
it is the third button of tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album are displayed on the work@@ list .
note that there is a check @-@ in before each line of a piece . only the titles are selected . a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece one or off . make sure all the pieces select , or push the button all the pieces on the bottom of the screen to pick all the pieces at once .
by clicking on the button select the reading process appears , this window appears to confirm . click OK and then we will see a look at the window with the entries and follow what is going on .
click on the tab for switching to the window window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the tool bar .
this is the window to control the orders . the first piece is being read on the hard disk . the status of the program is displayed in the lower part of the window in the status bar .
you can see this error message when you are trying to work with a co@@ dec , which you have not yet installed . pieces that have not been successfully encoded with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the file for the T@@ MP file and the target folders are not what we have entered here in the example . have you checked if you have a write access to the folder for temporary files and target folders ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the first piece .
the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the coding of piece 1 into the format MP3 . to read out and code parallel . note the status itself in the lower part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has no configuration settings to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only machine that seems configur@@ able is the result of parallel processes to read and code . when performing machines , the machine used with an AM@@ D@@ 64 seems to have no problem with simultaneous expres@@ sions and coding ( from but two different pieces ) .
now the last title is read out , while another piece is encoded , and a third order is co@@ ded in the queu@@ e of the Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers . after the last piece is co@@ ded , a small window will be displayed with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ ds ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . or 4.x and cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG , you need the code of your choice .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ rem ; if you &apos;re familiar with CVS , you can get an anonymous copy here . most distri@@ butions do already contain a pre @-@ compiled package , as &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cia ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ p ; -@@ package is . if you &apos;re reading this , you probably already did it ...
this section is directed to individuals that comp@@ ile from source files , and not for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of your distribution .
if you are looking for help , how the program can be adapted to your needs if it is running , then the following is right for you :
a program that calls for many different programs , many variants of settings . best you can learn the step by step example to get the options and settings . it displays screen shots of different card maps and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example .
hello , always read on ? even if only the help menu has been clicked on , without any reference point as it is to go on from this somehow empty screen ( especially if there is no audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from the un@@ usually short menu ?
what is it about ? who reads this , probably already started the program . it should look somehow like this :
a bad example : unfortunately , no email . the author can &apos;t add or change this manual . it is the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ ; it is . at least only after contact with the author . and if you read this , he has agreed this section and is therefore agreed with this suggestion .
strange when it succe@@ eds to pick up the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need this information , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MID@@ I@@ - and Kara@@ ok@@ esp@@ iel@@ er of &amp; k@@ de ; in addition to others , he has no features with real @-@ time graphic and kar@@ aoke dial@@ ogues , also some features that have no other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; support to all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; support also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ as@@ ound projector , which is needed for G@@ US @-@ cards . AL@@ SA is included when it supports a sequ@@ enti@@ er .
&amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color so that it is easy to follow the piece .
graphic presentation of the activity of each MIDI channel by touching the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop so that you can drag in &amp; drop ; each MIDI file from a &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ windows on KM@@ id can be moved .
supports both existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( property events or tex@@ tures ) . KM@@ id automatically determines the procedures used .
seat support . when you end &amp; kiss ; during the shooting of a song , KM@@ id starts again with the same song again .
supports external MIDI syn@@ thesizer , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P drivers and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can open ... from the menu file . it appears the usual file dialog , with which help you select the desired song .
you can also drop a file from a &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ windows to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ windows can be dropped also with several songs simultaneously .
to play a piece of music , open it and play the kno@@ b you play in the tool@@ bar , select the game play from the menu item , select the space bar .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts when you drag it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; ( with several pieces , they are added to a collection and then played together . )
as soon as &amp; k@@ mid ; play a piece , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and drive with the kno@@ b and drive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you find that a song is too fast or too slow , you can click on the left and right of the Tem@@ po@@ ad and thus change the speed . to return the original speed , double click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the space bar or the selecting the menu entry pause in the menu , interrup@@ ts playback . push the space bar while no play is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback .
lyrics can be saved on two types in a piece of music . some pieces use text event , others use lyrics events and again others . some pieces don &apos;t have any text : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can setup what events are displayed and even better : the event type is automatically selected , so you have to manually set the audio text , so you will automatically change the Karaoke text . but you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way .
if you want to set up an event type , select the text settings and property events from the menu settings . the same function also have the keys 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files which you can summar@@ ise . these will be played in the series after being played in this section , as you can efficiently use collections .
to create a collection , first open the collection manager . at first you will find the collection manager . click on New and give the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then specify the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs as the original .
if you have more than one collection , you can set the always set out in the collection manager .
in the temporary collection all songs you want to add to any other collection .
when applying the application , this collection is not stored . remember that if you add many pieces .
to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song to the Collection Manager . it appears in turn the file dialog , with which help you select the desired song .
a second method to add a song depends on Set@@ ting Autom@@ atically Add the Collection .
when automation add to the collection , a piece is automatically added to the active collection ( using File Open or Dra@@ g &amp; Drop ) .
when Autom@@ atically add to the collection , the temporary collection is activated and emp@@ tied when opening a piece . this collection will then be added to the opened pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , select the collection manager , select the collection and select the desired song and then click for removing .
you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the string from the sub@@ menu sequence of the menu collections , the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection .
when you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order will be re@@ defined .
to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the selection list above the Karaoke text .
to jump to a song , select the next song next song from the menu item , or press the arrow right .
to jump back to a song , choose the button pre @-@ previous piece to select the previous piece from the menu or press the arrow on the left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection and click the button to delete .
temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not matter , since it is not stored when leaving &amp; k@@ mid ; not stored .
this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thesizer , which are not general MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map General @-@ MIDI events will be translated into events that under@@ stands Syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers .
for example , you can create an MIDI map which converts all events of the Type Change patch to B@@ right piano into action of the Type Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et and therefore always a trumpet sound if originally a piano should play .
if you only have a sound card , you don &apos;t need MIDI map because all sound cards GM -@@ compatible are ( incl . A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) .
there is no programs to create MIDI maps . so you need to edit the appropriate file of your hand ( with your favorite editor ) .
an MIDI @-@ map is a text file that stores all required settings for playing a piece .
each section may appear only once , except the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section , which may appear as often as desired . requirement for this , however , that every occurrence has a different text ID ( see below ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; De@@ fine PAT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D De@@ fine NO Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Name of the Key@@ map &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; EN@@ D De@@ fine NO Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; EN@@ D De@@ fine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D Options ... EN@@ D &quot; &quot; &quot;
you see that de@@ bac@@ eous is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for Options ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as e @-@ mail , so I can offer future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support for devices which are not general MIDI compatible .
in this section is specified , as the patches of General MIDI is shown on your specific keyboard . the general use looks as follows :
please note that the left side of the principle is ignored . it is assumed that the GM Pat@@ ches are in the right order ( from 0 to 127 ) , you may not change the order and leave no line for one of 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to make all sounds that require this instrument to play with the number M . if your keyboard supports no tissue shot ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which is similar to a tissue shot ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which is similar to the PAT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section :
so if a MIDI file is supposed to play a patch with patch 127 ( Gun ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of which clay is in the MIDI @-@ file .
please note , here with the term drum patch of the patch is meant , with which every sound represents a different Per@@ cus instrument ( drum , pel@@ vis , mar@@ acas &amp; etc ; ) , and not the one with which the sound indicates the pitch of the same drum ( like some keyboards ) .
the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section is used to specify how sounds are shown on a particular channel or instrument . the use is :
like the PAT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section , the order of the lines is very important as its presence . thus , 128 entries must be created .
you can define multiple keywords for each channel and instrument . you only have to use different names in the first line .
Key@@ maps are used mainly to set tones on the Per@@ kus@@ sions channel . look at the included key@@ maps for example .
this section can be used to connect some channels to others . if you wish to change the first and the second channel , you simply do it in the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section .
however , these settings are useful for keyboards , which have the percussion on a particular channel ( General MIDI to channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , arranged according to the following pattern :
n is the channel that is depicted on channel N . if you are using the Key@@ map option , you will need to change the Key@@ map name for this channel . if you are using the For@@ ce@@ patch option , you will need to change the patch on this channel . in this case patch x will be used .
the For@@ ce@@ patch option may be useful for example to always use the Per@@ kus@@ sions patch on the Per@@ kus@@ sions channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der is multiplied in which ratio pitch @-@ ben@@ der events will be multiplied when an MIDI @-@ file is equivalent to the value n , this is used with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then for@@ warded it . the value 40@@ 96 is used so that in the map file no dec@@ imal notation is used .
this setting is used because GM is trying to play a pitch , which is to play pitch with the value 40@@ 96 , but try to play some keyboards up to one oct@@ ave . in order to find the correct value on your keyboard , you have to taste a bit with &amp; k@@ mid .
to use a MIDI map , just open the MIDI @-@ settings dialog . you can find this in menu below settings , point MIDI settings
the can@@ al@@ view is a window with a full range of cla@@ vi@@ atures ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on this keyboard , you see which sounds are played straight .
you can also use the can@@ al@@ view to change the instrument on a particular channel . for each channel , there is a select list where you have modified an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the button doesn &apos;t get green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used .
the can@@ al@@ view ( up to now ) has two different views to show the played tones . viewing the Settings menu , select Settings menu under the Point Channel View : settings
the pace @-@ LCD shows the speed , which is played a song . the higher the number , the larger the speed .
you can change the pace of a song . if you find , a song is too fast to follow the text , you can slow down it . to change the pace , use the arrows to turn left and right from the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file that has to be played like a piece of music , it contains the notes , the rhythm , speed , &amp; etc ; . thus , the same MIDI file may lead to very different results , just as two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways .
well , I can &apos;t force anyone to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 file needs 4 MB ( an compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything .
this may happen if you have compiled a bin@@ ar distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) by &amp; k@@ mid ; because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support has been compiled . to fix the problem you have to download and install a source distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos; s start page )
I &apos;d like to add a whole folder to a collection but I do not want to add all files individually .
agree , that &apos;s why &amp; k@@ mid ; Dra@@ g &amp; Drop . simply open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; select all files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window .
before setting , enable automatic adding to the collection . otherwise , the temporary collection files will be added to the temporary collection .
you can use the arrow keys on the left of Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow down playback . in order to restore the standard temp@@ o you can double click on the LCD .
I have on a &amp; k@@ de ; desktop a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window with my MIDI @-@ file and &amp; k@@ mid ; in this way I need to play a MIDI file or if I want to play a file , only in the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; turn the file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid ; draw .
if you want to listen to a file only once , without adding them to a collection , turn the settings Settings , and the new ; file will be added to the temporary collection of files
we assume you have MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . first you only want to play the first file . so , set the settings Autom@@ atically add to the collection and open A@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection contains exactly this a MIDI file .
then join us also to play B.@@ ID and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
these people have sent me MIDI files or postcards . thank you ! if I hear these songs or I see the postcard , animated me on &amp; k@@ mid ; to program .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Anton@@ i@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez . I &apos;m studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ zur@@ ich . I &apos;m studying in my third year , so I &apos;m not trying to take a little time for my hobbies , but I try to collect MIDI files , making music and prove pro@@ positions .
if you want to know where to download MIDI / kar@@ aoke files , if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you want to make me happy , write an email : lar@@ pink @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ enn@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es
you really make me a huge joyful anticip@@ ation , if you send me a postcard from your residence or a MID@@ I@@ - / kar@@ aoke file from a local group . all those who want to send me a postcard or an MIDI file , if you want to receive an MIDI file , then you should contact me as I might have the file .
I &apos;ve written &amp; k@@ mid ; fully written in my spare time and I don &apos;t want to do any money in my spare time . I &apos;d like to emphas@@ ise it because / when I get feedback of users ( post cards or e @-@ mails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - Con@@ vert the error that the pitch was too high for AW@@ E maps .
my thanks also applies to Jose L@@ us San@@ chez and for testing the G@@ US support , Ign@@ acio Garcia for testing the AW@@ E support , Peter G@@ rit@@ sch , Peter G@@ rit@@ sch , Peter G@@ rit@@ sch , Peter G@@ rit@@ sch , Thor@@ sten Wes@@ thei@@ der , Ulrich Cor@@ des and anyone who sent me a patch , a error alert , or also only a supp@@ or@@ tive e @-@ mail .
and of course my thanks also applies to all these excellent musicians on the net , which give us this wonderful MID@@ I@@ - and kar@@ aoke files .
additionally you can find &amp; k@@ mid ; also found on his homepage , which is located under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ pink / k@@ mid@@ .@@ html . on the homepage you can track the development and look at links to pages with other kar@@ aoke songs , &amp; etc ;
a sound@@ card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer , as the sound quality depends on your sound card . it is not the same if you use a FM radio or AW@@ E card .
if you don &apos;t have a sound card , you must comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ mid ; with the parameter MO@@ DE _ D@@ EM@@ O _ ON@@ LY@@ V@@ I@@ SU@@ AL . then it runs as if you could have a sound card , except that you can &apos;t listen to music .
if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ ittens ; mailing lists or send an error alert directly to me .
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is a simple user interface for M@@ Player , Phon@@ o and FF@@ M@@ peg . the program is used to play video files produced by M@@ Player or Phon@@ on supported formats , as well as DVD &apos;s , VCD or TV and camera .
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not finished as &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this computer .
for additional help please check the page The K@@ DE site on new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; user mailing list .
the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally , there is an information window that will only be displayed if you want to retri@@ eve information inside .
it is possible to en@@ rich the preferred connections with the Book@@ marks , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries , which will be played after each other , you should use the category long playlist .
of course , you can add groups to groups to get an additional hier@@ arch@@ ical level . when you balance an entry , his group and all its sub@@ groups will be copied to the current category and the play begins with the cli@@ matic entry .
the categories &apos; hot pieces &apos; , TV and Permanent play@@ lists can also be changed by direct editing of XML configuration files . the various files in the directory ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / can also be changed by an editor , but also by the application itself . by clicking on a sub@@ group , only the XML content of this part is displayed .
after changing the XML files , you must be selected from the menu and select either the mode , or select a different category .
all changes are lost when processing mode left or the other group is selected without the playlist .
as a result of the convenience of the author of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; some features can be switched on only by changing the XML configuration files .
animation at start@@ up can be disabled by editing for ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c and changing &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 ob@@ server option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not available , it can simply be inserted .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; will see the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / k@@ m@@ player / intro@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / k@@ m@@ player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
the starting animation doesn &apos;t need to be short , it will automatically termin@@ ate by opening another source . this would end with the end animation however , the user can end the application a second time .
a simple example of a start @-@ animation can be displaying : &amp; lt ; body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gif &quot; ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; In alphabetical list of testing and some examples of SM@@ IL will be supported by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ;
there is a tab for the configuration of M@@ Player in the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; . here , the path from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data base can be set out of the network and other things .
another tool for trou@@ bles@@ hooting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool bar of k@@ m@@ player . here , the output of m@@ player is evident .
there is no rider for this playback tool in the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; . everything must be configured by manual editing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c . here is an example of how a &apos; flash &apos; is played with the module sw@@ ast@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played inside &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; it can even be inserted into the special box Emb@@ ed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
to play the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages , the &amp; k@@ m@@ player must be used as a service provider for the M@@ ime Type application / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave flash in setup dialog file assignment of K@@ DE .
the con@@ quer@@ or or &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; can be used in a consoles application and to search for error messages concerning charging the browser module . if no errors occur , the back@@ end output within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) .
so always a given back@@ end for a particular M@@ ime type ( of course only if this has been determined ) , this must be done by manual changing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c . for example , phon@@ on should play all og@@ g files :
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; can play with TV cards , either via M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this requires k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be checked , you need to use the used device and the TV channels . this can be edited manually from the configuration dialog , or the configuration file can be edited manually .
to configure the V@@ DR ( video data rec@@ orders ) Settings in the k@@ m@@ player is the dialog in the Settings - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le@@ - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . there you should be detected by which one is selected . ( e.g. , PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a DVB @-@ in box .
since the V@@ DR support of k@@ m@@ player can only use X@@ Video ( probably this type of playing video devices under Linux is the only one ) . this is why the video@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension must be functional for the X server . therefore , this must contain the following function in its configuration file ( / etc / X11 / XF@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) .
internally displac@@ ed S@@ MB for the sources are used for sources different names . at the time of creating this documentation , this dv@@ d@@ nav@@ source , intro@@ d@@ source , t@@ v@@ ector , t@@ v@@ ector , t@@ v@@ ector , v@@ cd@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . if they are activated , they start playing the playlist .
is there some hints as I can do my CD@@ ROM drive when I play of it ( not from the VCD : / / ) ?

QT ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a library for C + + for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and is needed for comp@@ iling of &amp; k@@ ile ;
Lat@@ ex ; : professional writing application . under Unix @-@ like systems , it will likely be res@@ orted to the package &amp; tex@@ live ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the &amp; Linux distribution ; for installation , documentation of the distribution and installation CD ; / DVD can be used .
the &amp; k@@ ile ; project contains some already compiled packages of &amp; k@@ ile ; for various distri@@ butions . these allow an easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the k@@ ile ; website included .
this hand@@ book is for everyone - regardless of the experiences with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; k@@ ile ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users must hardly read this manual . however , all suggestions for documentation should be taken into account . if the support is requested for this project or its documentation , the contact must be made via the tile ; website .
if you have questions to or at the comp@@ iling of &amp; k@@ ile ; on or if extensions want , this should be addressed to the mailing list k@@ ile @-@ dev@@ el @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; k@@ ile ; it is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; desktop . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers the possibility to use all &amp; lat@@ ex ; functions in a graphical interface and within this one simple , comp@@ iling and bug tools for this . conclu@@ sive , the easy @-@ to @-@ use wiz@@ ard , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference and powerful project management .
to learn more about Kate ; and to discover its possibilities the hand@@ book should be attracted to Kate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; can start directly with reading the chapter of work with the editor of &amp; Kate ;
for &amp; lat@@ ex ; is the correct pron@@ unci@@ ation : L@@ ay @-@ TECH . you can use the ur@@ ski@@ p@@ able &amp; tex ; difficult to use , can also use an av@@ ie ( engl@@ . lay ) &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ mac@@ ros is also a less demanding but more realistic exhau@@ st@@ ion that it desc@@ ended from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La mp@@ ort .
here &apos;s only a good visibility to &amp; lat@@ ex ; given , it is not the ultimate book to treat &amp; lat@@ ex ; right to rule , good B@@ Ã ¼ cher such as H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ AL@@ Y , A Guide to &amp; lat@@ ex ; : document Pre@@ par@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Users , 3rd Edition , 1999 d@@ af@@ Ã ¼ r .
just like other out@@ drawing languages , &amp; lat@@ ex ; an introduction to which the gener@@ ational features such as paper format , page number@@ ing and text area will be fixed with the command \ \ &apos; document@@ a , the Cologne will begin with the command \ \ &apos; begin { document } and must be closed again with the command \ \ &apos; { document } .
the Quick @-@ asc@@ ension Assistant by &amp; k@@ ile ; is a useful function for rapid creation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; . selecting the wiz@@ ard ( Men@@ Ã ¼ ) offers some opportunities for creating the document . it can also be done some on the document related settings .
document categories : this is the type of the document to be created : article ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , article &#91; reference &#93; , article ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , Report ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ p@@ pr@@ t &#93; , projector &#91; reference &#93; , film &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or user defined .
encoding : this allows the encoding of the system . modern systems increasingly use UTF @-@ 8 encoding as standard . if UTF @-@ 8@@ x should be used ( for correct processing the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used additional packages for &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the binding it only radi@@ ates in the check box .
articles ( DIN ) , Book ( DIN ) , Report ( DIN ) , Cover ( DIN ) : the document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( in compliance with German DIN regulations ) . you should always use German texts .
new users do not have to worry about . it is merely a brief description of the functions and further information to be given in the section .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers - just like other source code editors - the emphasis of used commands , att@@ itudes and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ) . by &amp; k@@ ile ; it &apos;s evident from the modest appearance of the output file . however , you might have noticed by the modest appearance of output file . however , you will save you by the emphasis of time and more .
when entering a new command ( for example \ \ &apos; begin { command } ) of &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically a blank line ( for input text ) and the da@@ in@@ ted line to the end of the command ( e.g. \ \ &apos; { command } ) . this function can be found in the menu settings ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X commands are de@@ activated .
all documents are usually divided into few elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; encourage the document of the document into the following elements ( part is the most beautiful and subtle element ) :
in the view of the document in structure view the individual elements can be viewed by a mouse click on the respective change and viewed .
when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be very helpful . once a DVI @-@ file ( Eng@@ l . D e V ice I n@@ osed File ) &#93; has been created , jumps &amp; k@@ ile ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in DVI ; viewer on the corresponding line in &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code .
a DVI ; file contains a description of the format document and also other information such as the font , and also other information such as the font color ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; . there are many tools to view , conversion and for printing from DVI ; files for different systems and devices .
when using the file @-@ search engines , the elements of DVI ; file with the editor has been clicked on , is the exact opposite . as soon as it was clicked on a section in &amp; lat@@ ex ; the source code was clicked on the appropriate place in the DVI ; viewer flo@@ ps .
Master @-@ Document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a master document , working with other integrated .@@ tex files is simplified . when using a project , a project @-@ wide Master Document can be submitted to project project settings .
quick : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled automatically and the result is automatically displayed ( if no errors occur in the source code ) .
file access : in this mode , the DVI @-@ file will be imposed on the extent of the extent and it takes no appeal by &amp; ey@@ ep@@ ie@@ ce ; following the quick@@ est .
regarding the Edit -@@ tool@@ bar , the three major selection fields should be found in the document . the first selection panel is designed for rapid breakdown of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... The ver@@ itable &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands for the sub@@ division are :
the drop down menu is for example , for example , such as tags , fu@@ sions , notes or wise . the possible options are :
name : this command is a name for a section , a picture or a different element .
reference : is used for reference to a specified name ( selection over a selection field ) .
when using quot@@ ation is displayed a selection list with literary entries . for the editing of &amp; Bi@@ b@@ Te@@ x ; files are needed appropriate editors . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; - files can also be written in &amp; k@@ ile ; by hand .
the final sel@@ ector field with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ e is used for setting the fonts . it can be specified for the main text , the text notes , etc . , the following font names are available :
when calling &amp; k@@ ile ; two sel@@ ections are available for disposal : 1 . the assistant for creating a new document by selecting the document type and st@@ acking settings . 2 . the document can be written by reason on hand .
the brackets according to the command \ \ &apos; document@@ s contain the settings for the command . the font is set forth . the font is not set at the beginning , it may also happen in the text .
once the above source code has been entered , the &amp; lat@@ ex has to be compiled . the sim@@ pl@@ est way to this is the use of the menu building or the push of the button .
the source code must be saved before comp@@ ile . &amp; k@@ ile ; for storing the storage automatically .
in case the comp@@ iling of the document fails , should be searched after the errors . when using Quick construction , &amp; ey@@ ep@@ ie@@ ce should be started . if this is not the case , the log should also be considered .
an area ( engl@@ ish@@ .@@ environment ) is a text which is handled differently than the rest document . for example , a report with the font names should have a different font . the command \ \ &apos; begin { prolifer@@ ation } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ &apos; { prolifer@@ ation } . the command \ \ &apos; , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ &apos; { Field } .
the possible changes will only be careful within the environment ( from \ \ &apos; = &apos; environment } to \ \ &apos; { prolifer@@ ation } . there are no costs ( number ) for the possible changes within a environment .
there are many opportunities for the possibility of read@@ ability and us@@ ability of the document . for example , certain fonts , fat pressure , cur@@ sions , under@@ stra@@ ctions , etc can be collected . these commands are either by command \ \ , or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ &apos; begin { emp@@ h } : this command is available for the short pressure and is long as long as available , until it is closed with a \ \ &apos; { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in one sentence can be displayed using \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ Qu@@ ote : creates a quote in the document . the quote starts with \ \ &apos; begin { Qu@@ ote } and ends with \ \ end { Qu@@ ote } .
after the background to write the source text with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; pron@@ unci@@ ation language is presented , a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; .
as soon as the assistant was entered a bit of text , there should be a few adap@@ t@@ ations for the better read@@ ability of the document . a quote , a few places in fat and spa , and a poem to apply to see the differences of these commands .
once the document has been viewed , an editor @-@ view or C@@ trl E may be returned to the editor ( in internal viewer ) . with an external viewer , its window must be closed .
once the DVI @-@ file has been created , the document can be printed or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file is converted . just try and have fun .
DVI ; is a bit of file format ( engl . D e V ice I n@@ op ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi output like printer , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF converter or computer screens .
for printing a &amp; DVI ; file the same steps as for the creation of the document is available ( see ) . in the 7th step - by clicking on it , you can print the document using file printing ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the tool bar involves the conversion of DVI ; file in other formats . once the DVI ; file created from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code created , the conversion into any other formats can begin using the kno@@ b PF@@ E in the tool@@ bar .
the advance search will encourage the direct jump from the editor to da@@ isy @-@ open position within the DVI ; -@@ file .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers a corresponding setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; bin@@ aries . for this purpose only modern under settings K@@ ile will have to set up ... tools in building .
in order to look for the incident , the cur@@ sor must be clicked on one line of the source text , and close on forward . the jump to the corresponding place in DVI ; viewer then takes place .
this function in &amp; ey@@ ep@@ ie@@ ce ; with one click of the middle mouse button in DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; read &amp; k@@ ile ; in &amp; ey@@ ep@@ ie@@ ce ; in &amp; ey@@ ep@@ ie@@ ce ; set up as text editor ( settings ey@@ ep@@ ie@@ ce ... Editor )
if using Quick &amp; DVI &gt; Use quick , an error can be found . should an error occur , this will be displayed in the log file or in the message window .
the logging file ob@@ struct the error source in the source code . in the editor , the dum@@ b error messages can be seen from the errors . in order to see the error in the log file , you have to click on the error in the log file . click on the error in the log file .
as soon as the button is clicked on the tool@@ bar button , a window appears to select the template for the document . the pre @-@ set values are :
when selecting a blank document , a document may be re @-@ written either by reason or the wiz@@ ard for fast creating a new document . further information is included in the section .
H@@ Ã ¢ tier users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; use mostly the same introduction to virtually all documents . templates can be created in &amp; k@@ ile ; created , stored and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either a existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file can be created or a new file created . &amp; k@@ ile ; can create a new template by using an existing document and selecting file template from document ... create .
when creating a new document from a template using file New , some strings are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set up in settings K@@ ile ... Settings General .
when creating your own template , it is necessary to know which strings from which variables are replaced :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ M@@ ENT@@ CL@@ AS@@ SO@@ P@@ TI@@ ON@@ S $ : this string is replaced by the input in document category . typically , they will be used as follows : \ \ &apos; document@@ s $ $ DO@@ CU@@ M@@ ENT@@ CL@@ AS@@ SO@@ P@@ TI@@ ON@@ S $ $ &#93; { items } .
the sim@@ pl@@ est way to create a template is the use of the wiz@@ ard and the use of commands in the editor . once the document has been created in this way , the following steps has been completed :
when creating a new document , you can choose your own template instead of default .
a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ files can be created . a simple way for creating a template should be searched after an online search and the steps described below steps .
&amp; k@@ ile ; used &amp; Kate ; as an internal editor . &amp; Kate ; is a Tex@@ ts@@ dit@@ or for program@@ mers with many different types of text files ( including &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; Bi@@ b@@ Te@@ x ; ) . many settings for &amp; Kate ; can be made directly from &amp; k@@ ile .
to learn more about Kate ; and his abilities to find the manual to Kate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; can be heard there directly with reading the chapter of Working with the editor of &amp; Kate ;
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; command @-@ reference which can be called for by the La@@ Te@@ X reference . it contains a complete description of almost all commands that can be found in &amp; lat@@ ex ; use and syntax .
double @-@ double click on the trl @-@ button to replace the &amp; tex ; this means that in this way you will be able to use \ \ par \ \ par \ \ by \ \ par \ \ par .
when drawing the text with penet@@ rating left mouse button , the full text is automatically copied to the clip@@ board .
when using the arrow keys with penet@@ rated light , parts of the source code can be selected in the editing window .
&amp; k@@ ile ; has the ability to search for most types of source texts and emphas@@ ise them . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands from normal text and also the mathematical form@@ ulas are highlighted by another color .
many assist@@ ants can be found . this is an own kind of book@@ marks in the text . the menu entries are highlighted in the text . this jump is also highlighted so that they are automatically logged in with the first input of a sign .
the editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program such as &amp; k@@ ile ; although &amp; Kate ; already excellent yields , were added in &amp; k@@ ile ; important functions for the writing of a &amp; lat@@ ex ; available in &amp; k@@ ile ; special commands for their selection . under editing options , the following commands are included in the text @-@ code :
covers a complete paragraph ( group of lines containing on both sides an empty line ) . this extended significance does not include tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands and all other lines of the source text . the only di@@ vest@@ ing thing in &amp; k@@ ile ; it is the only problem separated by two empty lines .
changes the word under the current cur@@ sor position . this option also has an extended meaning as this command also has &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands with a track ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
for example a part of the document can then be removed from this first and can be removed by clicking the key C@@ trl ; K with its own commands to be removed . &amp; Kate ; with your own commands you can contain a faster mixer . under editing , include the following commands to include the text :
removes a complete paragraph . the definition of a paragraph in &amp; k@@ ile ; is contained in the description to edit EQU@@ IP@@ MENT paragraph .
it has already been clari@@ fied that environments play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore , &amp; k@@ ile ; for further commands under Edit environment for a simple work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; .
this command is inj@@ ected to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly before the command to be placed .
this command is inj@@ ected to end up the current location ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to close the surrounding area .
if the cur@@ sor is in front or within the command \ \ &apos; budget { surrounding } , is inj@@ ected to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
with the input of many missing ambient commands can quickly be lost . this command can be quickly lost , so that the surrounding environment is not dis@@ astro@@ us .
&amp; k@@ ile ; also offers special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups which are determined by stap@@ les { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group are some important commands that match those from Edit surroundings .
this command is inj@@ ected to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the welded terminal .
this command is inj@@ ected to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the damaged be@@ holder .
if the cur@@ sor is in front or behind the welded terminal of a &amp; tex ; group # is bound to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
with the input of many welded groups , groups can quickly be lost . this command will close the last group , so that the dis@@ appearances structure of &amp; tex ; groups can not be dis@@ astro@@ us .
in &amp; lat@@ ex ; two simple beginnings are used in &amp; k@@ ile ; for which the instructions are used in &amp; k@@ ile ; for the opening of the beginning , the sign is &quot; used . &quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; knows this case and for two ready @-@ to @-@ end instructions for &amp; lat@@ ex ; one .
this automatic entry of the double status symbols can be set up under settings K@@ ile ... La@@ Te@@ X - and will be used .
there are also many other languages ( e.g. n@@ german or French ) and that German or French beginnings are used . there are also many other languages available .
for mounting of shift ; input paste for inser@@ ts &amp; k@@ ile ; if the current position is located within a lists environment ( e.g. en@@ um@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , apply &amp; k@@ ile ; not only a line of line but at the same time the command \ \ item .
in a tables environment , end &amp; k@@ ile ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with an end @-@ to @-@ date line @-@ up .
even better - &amp; k@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to under@@ score pre@@ set &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or custom environments . these can be found under settings ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X can be found .
some users can arrange the columns in tables and thereby assign all E@@ t sign ( amp ; ) each other . although this tab@@ ulator is not possible , for the next tab@@ ulator in the displayed line . although this tab has not been added , for the next tab@@ ulator for the columns position of the current tabl@@ ature .
although &amp; Kate ; already has a good source code reading , this was added in &amp; k@@ ile ; for special commands ( usually for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) are still extended . all these modes can be set up for different work modes including settings K@@ ile ... fully set up .
when starting a new environment using the command \ \ &apos; begin { surrounding } &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically add the command \ \ &apos; { surrounding } after an empty line ( for the text ) .
the last letter of the input bar will be removed and can be missed by entering the complete list . on the other hand , the list can be reduced by entering a further letters too .
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions are collected by selecting a command . alternatively , jump to these positions by editing hock marks N@@ Ã ¼ ch@@ est jump brand is possible , and the desired parameters will be cons@@ ulted then .
under settings k@@ ile ; set up ... hurry ; different settings can be made to these lists . you can set different W@@ alls for &amp; tex ; - und &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands and instructions of the general language used .
command mode is not n@@ ud@@ ed for the completion of environments . there are always a few letters with \ \ . begin to result in a large list with environment commands . on the other hand , the environments is used so often , that &amp; k@@ ile ; a special mode for the completion of environments for processing .
when calling for the edit environment , the command to edit the area or the keyboard @-@ key space , the command will automatically be incorporated into the environment and it appears \ \ &apos; begin . after that , the environment will be carried out in the easiest way and can be completed by clicking on the input bar .
after this is done , the environment will automatically be closed again . once &amp; k@@ ile ; recognize that it is a list environment , even a first \ \ item command will be used .
under settings k@@ ile ; set up ... hurry ; set up settings on these lists . this mode uses the list of behavior for the evaluation mode for &amp; tex ; - und &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands .
&amp; k@@ ile ; supported custom lists of text , which can be replaced immediately by l@@ ad strings . the lists can be set up under settings . for example , the file is ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , in which example the file L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included .
for example , the letter L is typ@@ ed and the word editing mode is replaced by the input device C@@ trl + Alt Space , the letter L will be replaced by the \ \ La@@ Te@@ X string .
large branch offices are not helpful for automatic sampling . however , it has been noted that many people in a document are more than once written . thus , &amp; k@@ ile ; the ful@@ fil@@ ment of all already written awareness .
this mode can be set up in the menu settings ... K@@ ile can be deported . here , the swelling value for the display can be specified here .
the files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / manually / mode / mode / mode / mode / mode / mode / mode / mode / mode or mode . mode is available for operation ( separate ) , Dictionary ( W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ buch ) or tex .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dialog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reflects graphics as simple as possible . for the view of the basics of the graphic formats the sections should be considered and respected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
PS files are not as known as PDF files , but offer an excellent basis for modifications and new orders of pages . if the PDF output is available , the pages will be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools re@@ arranged and then with ps@@ 2@@ pdf will be converted into a PDF file .
to treat the result of the work , you have to be compiled in the source code . all assembly tools are group@@ ed into the menu , creating comp@@ iling , creating and creating view .
for the comp@@ iling of the source text for viewer like &amp; ey@@ ep@@ ie@@ ce ; or the more conversion can be used by pressing Alt ; 3 viewed , using Alt ; 4 the DVI ; 4 the DVI ; file into a PS file and can be viewed by Alt ; 5 the PS file .
when using the command Rap@@ id , a viewer will normally be called after the comp@@ iling . if no one @-@ bound viewer should be used , each time will open a new window .
a new project will be presented in the project project .... The following information is asked for the project :
when selecting the file name window , the relative path must be specified from the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file .
the script function of &amp; k@@ ile ; allows the release of EC@@ MAS@@ cript - Ko@@ de . the scripts can be administered by scripts in the vertical body .
the API scripts are still not fully developed and can be found in further versions of &amp; k@@ ile ; still .
first , it has to be said that the work environment of the scripts in &amp; k@@ ile ; a system@@ ic object ( = k@@ ile ) has the following methods :
&amp; lat@@ ex ; is a quite sophisticated system , in which the basic functions are extended by a multitude of additional packages , offers a lot of different help to support users .
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ live ; are provided with many documents . there are a documentation for the contained packages and another &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference .
a ful@@ lest refer@@ ee for &amp; tex ; and in his &apos; Fre@@ un@@ de@@ â s Department . it is not just about a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) but rather it is ideal for searching for a specific form . since it is a very large document , it is divided into &amp; k@@ ile ; divided into three major book@@ marks .
based on the quantity of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; it is not always easy to find out , but the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k , which contains a database of all too &amp; k@@ ile ; delivered documents and herein , a graphic tor@@ ch .

everyone who has worked with the &amp; k@@ p ; documentation has been lab@@ elled and how over@@ power@@ ing it is . do we still need a piece , we give it a graphical interface ! simply click on a terminal ; simply click the icon for the XML processor and ready !
this application is an inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is located in the desired work folder , then leave the current working folder . if not , then remove the selection of current work@@ file and enter the desired folder in the File Name box .
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML files will be deleted whenever my pro@@ c is started .
as I said , each of which has been working on &amp; k@@ de ; documentation has already worked , knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; quantum le@@ us ; there is a great graphical interface for this .
if the newly opened file inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is , then simply leave the current working folder . if not , then select the current working folder and enter the folder where inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is to be found .
if it comes to an output at the screen , your file is fla@@ wed . please check the reported error and try again .
if the file is already checked in &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; then they can easily be checked in &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; if not , delete it at current file the tick and select the file to file the file selection file .
if you only want to know if the well @-@ being file is well , they will click the Well @-@ Pro@@ gress selection .

plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; may have a little to do with &amp; quantum le@@ us ; therefore , the plug @-@ in system is very powerful . you can &apos;t wait until someone can use it in &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; plug @-@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; read more about it below .
to install a plug @-@ in or a K@@ Part , we begin with the Edit plug@@ in Edit menu . thus , the following dialog is opened :
this dialog allows to manage all the plug@@ ins to manage and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug@@ ins without a storage location , it can be used &amp; quantitative ; this path to locate plug @-@ ins .
many people work in one way of hier@@ arch@@ ical relation to each other . &amp; quantum @-@ l@@ us ; supports the indication of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . Nick@@ name is the nickname of the user and serves to identify unique identi@@ fying .
one member can have multiple roles in the project , such as team leader as well as sub @-@ project leaders .
the user can choose from the list of Team members who he is . this happens when he searches the team member from the list and the S@@ etz@@ e button appears . the currently selected member ( your identi@@ fier ) appears bold after you are : lyrics .
nickname and setting of their own identity are important in terms of messages and comments . see further information for comments .
besides the overview of their team , there is another advantage by the cap@@ turing of the members of the team : it can create an event to information about the team leader if something specific happens . see in further information .
event actions are actions that are executed if something specific happened in the project . an example would be how much someone would have worked , or the sending of a message , if a file is assured , or a script that plays a file into CVS , as soon as they will be added to the project , etc ;
in the event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 project Project Properties dialog , events can be created , edited and deleted .
an email will be sent to the select address selected in the receiver . the address can be a team or sub @-@ project ladder . see in , we@@ i such leaders are set up .
notes are special comments in documents . they differ from normal comments by the following :
note : it is easy to enter the comment entry from the editor @-@ context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword in a comment area followed by typ@@ ing text .
notes can be sent to an assign@@ able member of the team . in this case , the name @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nickname ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( Role ) is a role in the project from the following possibilities : team leader Ber@@ eich@@ s@@ leiter Sub@@ project leaders According to the mountain range and sub@@ project leaders , as in the following examples below .
nickname and roll@@ ers names are independent of large or small immersion , but spaces around the brackets and the : make the note invalid .
&amp; quantitative ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and form@@ ati@@ zation languages supported by DT@@ D @-@ ag@@ nost@@ ic and web @-@ based form@@ atting and scrip@@ ting languages .
the settings are att@@ ain@@ able via the Settings menu . here only via &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ specific settings are handled , a short description for others can be found in .
the settings can be set up by adjustments to ... called . Dies@@ er@@ dialog covers some pages that are treated after each other .
the behaviour of &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; regarding tags including car completion can be changed . the entries are :
large / lower@@ case of tags : large / lower@@ case of automatically added tags . normal wholesale / lower@@ case means the tags are inserted as they are described in the XML files .
large / lower@@ case of attributes : large / lower@@ case of automatically added attributes . normal wholesale / lower@@ case means the attributes are inserted as they are described in the XML files .
optional tags : if requested , it is optional for tags , for which the closing day is optional , immediately after the &amp; gt ; inserted .
do not include optional tags : as above for all other tags , except the simple tags .
start and closing day automatically update : when on , the corresponding day is changed and vice versa .
automatic detection of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ entu@@ ated characters in the appropriate coding during in@@ ti@@ pping .
M@@ IME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for detection of different types of files . by using button standard , the default settings can be restored .
standard encoding : the coding of newly created or used in another way than with open File Open files ( where the encoding of the file may be passed ) , but this setting is om@@ itted by the same in the project properties , if a project is loaded .
standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D has not been recognized , but this setting is rejected by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
create a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; creates regularly backup copies , so you can restore the document from this backup by a black@@ out or crash when next start of the program . this is not the same as saving the file . also for nor stored documents , a backup is made regular , according to the set time .
the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editing field or its own view ( or documentation in a box ) which makes it possible to preview the documentation , preview and source code at the same time .
set the window settings back to the standard next start is useful when the user interface is modified by changing the MDI @-@ modes and and@@ ro@@ x / hin@@ ge of views . it corresponds to the --@@ stress @-@ layout command line parameter .
the warning lights section provides for the control of the possibility to reset the display of war@@ nings by any longer qu@@ eries .
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can specify the display of symbols instead of scripts just as the synchron@@ ization behavior of V@@ PL@@ - and source code in divided mode .
here the par@@ ser and the structural tree , which represents the illustration of the Par@@ ser node in the document , can be adjusted in detail .
in the mouse click the structural tree causes the following action , it is possible to change the action through clicking the structural tree with the mouse buttons .
in the field of structural tree settings the visibility of no@@ des in tree , the update frequency of the tree to be opened automatically when empty groups are open automatically , while empty groups are in the text , while empty groups such are no element found in the current document .
the area for finding short@@ cuts ( a kind of templates ) which can be un@@ folded in groups , each can be valid for multiple &amp; DT@@ EP ; s are valid for multiple &amp; DT@@ EP . this means that there can be a valid group for PHP , which means the if@@ it short@@ cut something else than in a group valid for Javascript .
this plug @-@ ins can be managed by plug@@ ins . plug@@ ins are K@@ Part applications from the third side , which can be re @-@ used by each K@@ Part @-@ enabled application , on the most well known &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; when adding a plug @-@ in file the following must be specified :
address : the path to plug @-@ in if there is not at a standard like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / lib .
input : this information will be delivered to the plug@@ in when you start , so it can open the current folder ( path of current file ) or the file folder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; components in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Only @-@ Read Only &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mode : check if the plug @-@ in is denied the loading . only @-@ Read @-@ K@@ Parts usually refuse the loading if this option is not selected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
check the plug @-@ in : is this enabled , then tests &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; if the entered information is correct . select the application if the plug@@ in is not available at the moment , but it will be installed later .
for &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from version 3.3 , the trou@@ bles@@ hooting has been completely re@@ designed . ( 3 ) Deb@@ ug@@ ger was termin@@ ated as well as the support for db@@ g de@@ bu@@ gger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in concept was implemented , which allows various implement@@ ations of plug@@ ins .
currently only a plug@@ in is available , the support for using &amp; gu@@ bed ; in@@ qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; inser@@ ts .
the use of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in into the project settings . with the Options button next to the de@@ bu@@ gger plug@@ in selection field , the specific settings can be changed .
if a de@@ bu@@ gger is activated for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; quantum le@@ us ; user interface :
a view in which the content of the monitored variables is displayed . appears normally in the left dock .
a view in which all stops , with line numbers and conditions are listed below . appears normally in the lower dock .
a view that is shown in the output ( as in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger . appears normally in the lower dock .
depending on the supported features of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available .
with this action , the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger , if necessary , is made , or she shares the plug @-@ in with to debit claims . this action is opened by default , so that a de@@ bu@@ gger is used so that normally it doesn &apos;t have to be noticed .
the counter@@ part to de@@ bu@@ gger session Start the session . closes the link to de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates the leaves according to requirements .
sends a HTTP request to the server to initi@@ ate a de@@ bug requirement . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to view the current document . the issue of this requirement is displayed in the de@@ bu@@ gger issue .
de@@ bug@@ ging the de@@ bu@@ gger , to start with the execution of the script and to send the information on the monitored variables as well as the currently run line . if this is done , the execution is started when a de@@ bug pass has started , the script starts with the requirement .
de@@ bug@@ ging the de@@ bu@@ gger , to start with the execution of the script without sending information on Surveillance variables and the current line number . if this is done while a script is given , the execution begins as soon as a request is provided .
the de@@ bu@@ gger will execute the next instruction in the script without entering the functions or includes .
the de@@ bu@@ gger will execute the next instruction in the script if possible in functions and includes faul@@ ts .
de@@ bug@@ ging the de@@ bu@@ gger , to skip the order and go to the next so as if there were not the current one .
open a dialog , where a variable or an expression can be entered , which should be monitored . the super@@ vised value appears in the variable form .
this dialog can enter a variable or set a new value of a variable .

this chapter describes how you can adapt &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to adapt to your needs and how you can and qu@@ anti@@ ze ; help to get better .
document type Edit@@ ing pack@@ ete ( DT@@ EP ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to give support for Mark@@ up@@ - and Script languages ; they enable &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; abilities and flexibility make &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developer , easy to use and productive .
&amp; DT@@ EP ; s are in two types , family 1 , the Mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script language or &amp; CSS ; and Tag@@ XML files are contained in two parts , the tag and tool@@ bars ; and Tag@@ x@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and Tag@@ XML files are included , symbol@@ ising text and instructions faster into a document as a user may vary .
&amp; DT@@ EP ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing DT@@ D . see for details on conversion .
this document describes how to create Tag@@ XML files , then the file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and tool bars . short , a &amp; DT@@ EP ; .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and content of the Fe@@ atu@@ res@@ dial@@ og@@ es , the &amp; quantitative information ; file contains the rules and information of &amp; DT@@ EP ; even . tool@@ bars offer a fast inser@@ tion of tags in a document without risk of a type@@ writer .
tag Fol@@ der are nothing known as folders . you only contain the file name &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folder bear the name of the prescri@@ ption language and version , so available . ( for example , html @-@ 4.0@@ 1 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML and declared if it is necessary , or not . although not all necessary , it is advis@@ able to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information in working with them .
the following chapter describes every element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limits is explained in a simple way .
this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains nothing else than just element .
the type of tags is a script function . when using &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; a argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
valid only for the Tag@@ type class . the name of the basic class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only valid for type Method . gives the name of the class where this method belongs . ( family 2 )
if yes , the day has a common attribute group and the attributes within these tags can be added to any other day . ( family 1 )
sets a text into the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is an only element type element .
describes a attribute of any tag . this element can only occur once for each attribute . additionally , it contains other tags that describe how this attribute is to be displayed &amp; etc ; This is an only element @-@ element .
provides the source code for the attributes in the tag editor and on the attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; quantitative is used to achieve the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method@@ name within &amp; quantitative is used to achieve the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a sec@@ tional type and a method@@ ology name . the arguments to be passed to the method . can be empty or % tag@@ en@@ ame % , which means the name of the current tags .
a container tag that group the elements of a list together . it can occur only once . it is an element type element .
sets the position of an attribute within a dialog box . this day can occur for each attribute in one dialog ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
gives the position and size of a field in dialogue . this day should be available for each field in the dialog ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this element is empty .
gives a list of elements that may be stored within the defin@@ ing tags . this element is an only element type .
gives a list of elements that end a day . this element is an only element type .
all Tag@@ XML files have to start with an &amp; XML ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = 1.0 encoding = 1.0 @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly ch@@ ained and closed .
spaces influence nothing , but pay attention to &amp; &amp; lt ; signs . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; can not be replaced , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to check the Tag@@ XML files , the tools dialog is up in &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Windows to start and check Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . a further dialogue will appear to follow the simple instructions .
this function is currently not available . currently , verification is only available when charging the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; quantitative ; .
in the following an example for a family 1 day XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; sch@@ ema &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3C ; &amp; XML ; sch@@ ema . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
in the following an example of a working family 2 Tag@@ XML @-@ file . in this file , a &amp; PHP file will be described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UTF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; lt ; tag name = &quot; over@@ load &quot; type = &quot; function &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt;
the file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is also quite simple and there is an editor accessible via DT@@ D . thus , di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; for a newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; for a newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; it should be done by simple &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; should be done with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; Version = Use 1 for &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; Version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = DT@@ D @-@ indication . ( / / W@@ 3C ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional / / EN ) Nick@@ name = The simplified name of DT@@ D . ( HTML 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nickname .
a action can set up actions ... created . click New Activity to the same dialog :
&quot; &quot; &quot; the button labeled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Un@@ defined button &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; with clicking the User button , you can assign a button to the button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current short@@ cut can be removed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sim@@ pl@@ est actions . it can be entered into the detailed settings and in execution of the action this text is inserted in the document at the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) which can change the document or as input ( or parts of the document ) , which are the quick@@ start @-@ dialog or the various see in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ DT@@ D .
first , the name of the script and interpre@@ ter must be specified . example : S@@ H / home / my@@ Home / my@@ scri@@ pt@@ .@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scri@@ pt@@ b variable in command line : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Quant@@ a / scripts in their path : $ PAT@@ H There are other special variable that can be used in command line :
% f : we are replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document file is file : / from the document name .
% p@@ id : is replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; quantitative ; only one instance is running , the text is unique to the P@@ ID number . this is useful when D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; used by the external script .
the parameter for this event , normally the fil@@ en@@ ame of the current document or the path to the project file .
in addition to the included methods , one script can oppos@@ e &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; at the default input . in the drop @-@ down input , the default input is to be sent to the default input . options are :
selected text : the selected range of document is sent to the script . the % input variable is normally useful with this setting .
according to the input , the output of the executed application can be re@@ directed . there are two types of output : normal edition , written to the standard output . it can be specified , which is set to the standard edition written by default , by the value the sel@@ ector issue is set :
if there are many tags in the Mark@@ up language , there is recommended to divide the tags in logical groups . in the case it is not too many , so you can create a tool bar with the name of the market .
once a tool bar is added , you must add and configure actions . select actions set .
the parts of this window are quite self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the new action button at the bottom end of the window starts editing mode .
fill out all the necessary fields and add the tag to the matching tool@@ bar .
complete all and if the day attributes has and you are planning its use , activate dialog &quot; edit &quot; when available to make a input when using the action is possible .
stop ! is this a ugly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? do we replace it before we have difficulty .
to create a symbol that the action represents better , we will use &amp; k@@ ic@@ one@@ dit ; choose from &amp; k@@ menu ; , graphics further programs ( or where else it is located in your distribution ) .
&amp; k@@ ic@@ one@@ dit ; used by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , choose the size of others .
please note that the created symbol is not only helps you to remember what the action does , but also all other users of the &amp; DT@@ EP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regarding that the day of start is , I decided to create a start@@ ing@@ button as a symbol . by using green ( green it is usually interpreted as a symbol ) , or at least , a message to the user is sign@@ alized , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a message to the user is a &amp; lt ; start to insert the tag in the current document . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after creating the symbol it has to be linked to the action . this is done through the menu with Settings ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; ) and selection of the desired action . in addition to the text box is a button , press it .
select the folder where the stored symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the button and continue with other tags , so there are or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to add some usual &amp; qu@@ anti@@ qu@@ us ; functions to tool@@ bar , or it should set them to better overview through some separ@@ ations in several groups . make sure to set the tool@@ bar dialog via Settings tool bar . make sure the tool@@ bar is selected .
I want to select the separ@@ ator ( all left above ) for my tool@@ bar . following the selection of the element that is to be added to tool@@ bar , press the arrow keys to the right . this adds the tool@@ bar element .
for example , I want a quick way to access the kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I &apos;ll select it and add to tool@@ bar .
please note , as the separ@@ ner support the group@@ ing . someone who doesn &apos;t know my tool@@ bar could believe that the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; button is the opposite of the start button .
the new tool bar must be tested by using all symbols , to ensure everything works .
if new XML does not exist , it will be created in the right folder , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the right folder . please adjust your tool bar , so that your tool bar will be loaded ( s ) if a file is opened from the respective type .
perhaps the most important extension of &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the normal user is the opportunity to add documentation for scrip@@ ting language or the form@@ atting language that you like to like . therefore , this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
before you start your own documentation , you could check at &amp; quantitative , whether somebody has done it for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you need to create an existing documentation for the form@@ atting / script / etc ; then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . then we will need to leave the do@@ cr@@ c file . we will leave the second part we will deal here .
# K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = pf@@ one , relative to this file , for example php@@ 42 / # Elements in the main index Top Element , e.g. php@@ 42 , # Sec@@ 2.3 , # Sec@@ 2.3 , # Sec@@ 2.3 , # Sec@@ 2.3 , # Sec@@ 2.3 , # Sec@@ 2.3 , # Sec@@ html @-@ 1 = Conference 2 html @-@ 1 = tag@@ 2.@@ html @-@ 3 = tag@@ 3.@@ html
the tree tree defines the visible aspect of documentation in the Document@@ ation tree . for example , see in the &amp; PHP ; documentation is something :
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = php@@ 42 / # top level Elements Top Element = PHP 4.2 Run = Table of Cont@@ ents , # Getting started , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ syntax . html ...
note the # before getting started and Language Reference . this indicates that it is a tree in tree with its own content . there is no known limit for chess problems ( except through reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
note that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and has to be displayed at the top end of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; file is displayed ! ) .
spaces are aff@@ ecting nothing , but pay attention &amp; &amp; lt ; signs . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ anti@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; resources are replaced .
the sy@@ no@@ cr@@ c file is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file , which is to be displayed in context of context @-@ sensitive help . by checking the function called and pressing C@@ trl ; H for context @-@ help the documentation would be shown directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Con@@ text List ) and the file binding lines .
a simple list of separated context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can save your file do@@ cr@@ c simply save it to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / doc / Quant@@ a / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / doc / Quant@@ a / doc for local and global use . then create a file in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation .
if you are sure that these good and worth are shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation have been used to the &amp; quantum le@@ us ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ itory for use by the &amp; quantum le@@ us ; -@@ community . they will not be rich , but proud to have been working on the best web development platform .
with &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the disc@@ losing resources ( DT@@ EP packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent by e @-@ mail to friends , partners or otherwise send an email , such as DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( DT@@ EP ) with email , tool@@ bar tool@@ bar with email , in the context menu files and folders in templates and scripts .
the resources can be uploaded to our main archive , where all the other &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Users are being checked and only available when our team needs them as a correct and usable for the publication . for example , we recommend a GP@@ G / PGP key . thus , the source of resources is ensured , both for our team and for later users .
when up@@ loading , you are asked to ask for their private GP@@ G key ( the Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase will not be stored ) , or in the case that you have multiple keys , you may need to select an input field ( URL preview can be empty ) and with clicking OK the up@@ loading will be launched .
the up@@ loading can be up@@ loading from the DT@@ D DT@@ D @-@ package ( DT@@ EP ) , tool@@ bars and folders in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts .
after downloading a resource , still before installation , exam@@ ines &amp; quantitative . in case of problems , it happens and then it can be canc@@ eled . if the integrity is given and the resource is signed , a notification will appear with the specification of the resource .
it is possible to work in XML languages , which is currently not able to work by &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; however , it can be time consuming , because hundreds of day files can be necessary in the XML format . there is easier way to convert DT@@ D automatically into a DT@@ EP package .
the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D menu and conver@@ ging of a DT@@ D . select the .@@ d@@ t@@ d file with the DT@@ D @-@ description , which should be used . afterwards , the following dialog appears :
target image : the newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Quant@@ a / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE Defin@@ itions : the string that should appear in ! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE tag , such as HTML PU@@ BL@@ IC - / / W@@ 3C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional / / EN htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e.@@ d@@ t@@ d should appear
fine adjustment of DT@@ EP after conversion : if enabled , &amp; quantum l@@ us ; after converting the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; it is recommended to use this option .
in &amp; quantum ap@@ l@@ us ; there are some key concepts . to understand these and full use of &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; first , you have to identify with these fundamental concepts , so this chapter is trying to close them with these basic concepts , without their understanding &amp; quantitative information ; little benefit .
in &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the working area is divided into three areas : global , locally and projection . this distinction concerns a range of components in &amp; quantitative .
global elements are available for each , the &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; uses , available . from tool@@ bars , everything is labeled , in the shared folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this allows the group of administ@@ rators to secure different tool@@ bars , actions and samples in the global tree , which will then be available in a multi @-@ user environment at the system .
local Elements represent a personal collection of web development agent for a single user . local elements are stored in the user directory so they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are only available within a particular project . this can be everything from &amp; CSS ; all elements are specially designed for files of a particular project . simply , this is the most limited size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , which is the common usage of special tools and patterns of all employees inside the project em@@ o@@ gli@@ des .
the &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ MDI ; consists of some main areas : the Edit@@ or@@ window , the construction manager , the boxes with info and tool@@ bars . please beat in , and for further information about these areas .
you can click on the tab with the right mouse button to obtain a context menu with the current document necessary , re@@ loading , delete or up@@ loading the document , jump to a book@@ marks or execution of CVS commands to the current document .
right section in the Edit@@ or@@ section leads to another context menu concerning the integrated document content , such as basic progress steps ( cut / copy / paste ) , editing the file under the mouse cur@@ sor , or opening the file , if the string is called a file under the mouse poin@@ ter .
at the top end of the Edit@@ or@@ f@@ enst@@ ers the tool bar is present . currently , &amp; quantum ; &amp; HTML ; 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional is shown as standard , for which a set of tool bar is shown . in the course of further development of &amp; quantitative , tool@@ bars will be adapted to new functions and thus alli@@ ed user needs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if they want to insert a single day , e.g. &amp; lt ; in its document , then click on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tag &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button , then you can insert the data for this just one day ( like anchor ) , you can fill in a dialog different fields . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the constructions ( Q@@ IT ; ) allows to navigate in the information about &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to navigate , to open and to go through . in the representation of boxes , project , pattern templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation .
project management is a powerful tool which provides &amp; qu@@ anti@@ ze ; this view displays all files in the project and allows the manage of files in the project with right mouse click . actions such as add , removing , upload or delete the files from the storage medium can be performed with then displayed context menu .
another way of &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the use of templates . almost anything can be a template : images , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc ; There are all options open .
templates can be divided into three categories , depending on which it is used . the category depends on &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the area is always available , local templates only for the corresponding users and templates in projects are available only in the project . more templates can be found in this project .
here you will find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of integration in global , local and project works too . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can download the information available to a script . via the right mouse button , further functions are available , such as the script to start , edit or send an email .
with this view one shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking a element , the cur@@ sor is set to the position of the element . by right clicking an element you will open a list of commands in terms of navigation and refresh@@ ment of the tree .
this tree appears among the other buildings . with it , man@@ fast attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces change . the content of all available attributes can be changed to the contents of all available attributes .
here is the full documentation to find web technology for your development . you can download documentation for &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from the quantum doc , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project can be edited . edited and considered .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; two tab@@ s at the bottom end of the window can be reached via the useful information window and the problem window .
this tab displays information on each script in a quantum running script . for example , the DT@@ D used the current document and all changes to DT@@ D are displayed .
this tab displays all error in the mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; quantitative , scripts that are executed , give all error messages ( such as there is ) in this window .
the &amp; quantum le@@ us ; tool@@ bars are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they receive the respective command . the chocolate bars of the tool bar is the possibility of defin@@ ing their own orders as symbols in &amp; quantitative .
another function of &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the ability to send a tool bar with e @-@ mail . &amp; quantum @-@ mail ; sends the tool bar as a compressed T@@ ar archive via &amp; K@@ mail ; if they charge a tool bar in an email , they can ass@@ ure them and load them !
it is reasonable if you want to adjust the place of &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ files on your system . for this , auto@@ conf has a number of options to get to the configure script . to get a complete list of options , type . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and not executed here .
if you have problems with starting &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should make sure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in PAT@@ H is in front of her bin folder . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; quantitative ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; quantum l@@ us ; was optimized for a fast web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
while making effort to create the best &amp; HTML editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us began to work with an obvious idea : what would be if &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; an independent , expand@@ able Mark@@ up language editor ? well , this would make him an absolutely greatest Web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer limited to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; quantitative : now already found on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then it should be qu@@ anti@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; it should be the appropriate &amp; IDE .
well , to the above mentioned requirement needs to be stated that &amp; quantum d@@ l@@ us ; as product based on the outstanding efforts of the whole &amp; k@@ kers ; follow , in good use of free software , the idea of why developer , is not only possible , but it allows users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; so to expand how they need it for their needs .
&amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; allows web development to boost the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( MDI ; ) . this can extend the automation nearly every task . by means of self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , you can expand &amp; qu@@ anti@@ ze . ( read more about it in . )
&amp; Quant@@ a ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it has been designed for fast web development and was quickly developed into a sophisticated editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; Quant@@ a ; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of &amp; Quant@@ a ; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more details in the details of the documentation is help with help : / Quant@@ a ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; input , or help hel@@ p@@ center help : / Quant@@ a ) .
&amp; Quant@@ a ; is currently being developed and supported by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon sequ@@ it@@ ur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ an@@ .org .
a quick access list of files you have opened . this list changes every time if you open a file , which is not located on it , the oldest entry is taken out .
this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . if you want to store in the section through templates . if you try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project device folder , only one error is reported .
to insert from the clip@@ board there are special characters to &amp; HTML ; description , so that it is displayed correctly and not be understood by the browser as form@@ atting .
converts the text from clip@@ board in &amp; URL , indic@@ ating that the correct way to inser@@ ting special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s are primarily used for inser@@ ting &amp; URL ; s into the anchor per day .
switches off or off . this allows you to select text blocks with the help of &amp; Shift ; touch display .
go directly to a line number . this is very helpful if you &amp; PHP ; error messages out !
searches for a string or regular expression in selected directory . a type gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expres@@ sions to help you .
displays the message window or not . that &apos;s the window where you see the display of scripts and de@@ bu@@ gger .
- and Swit@@ ching on the problem rep@@ orters at the lower edge of &amp; quantum le@@ us ; main window . the problem rep@@ orter is activated as soon as you change to the structural tree .
displays the symbol column left from the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a mouse click .
if the book@@ marks are available in the current file , they will appear in the menu with entries previous or next , depending on the cur@@ s@@ ors position in the document .
book@@ marks from other open documents appear in the menu group@@ ed according to the fil@@ en@@ ame of the other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard disk . &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; projects are stored with the extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog to add files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
searches the project directory after new files that could be there . this allows to copy graphic files to your project folders or a sub @-@ folder and then add them to the project .
loads the files in your project to the server high . the list of available transport methods depends on your Version of &amp; k@@ de ; from and if you have downloaded additional inputs / output modules ( K@@ io Sl@@ aves ) .
settings like &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the project administ@@ rates . in chapter &amp; quantum @-@ projects you will find details of the details .
loads a project tool bar . these are stored in the project You / Tool@@ bars and are only in this menu if you have assigned it to this project .
a dialog to save your tool@@ bars . allows you to select the tool bar type : local or project .
open a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this creates only the name . actions need to be added using settings . tool@@ bars are stored on tool@@ bars and you will be asked when you want to store the tool@@ bars .
removes a tool@@ bar from the field . del@@ etes it not from the hard disk . if you haven &apos;t saved the tool bar , you will be asked if you want to do this .
this allows you to send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( maybe to the &amp; quantum h@@ us ; - team , that the tool bar is present in the next publication ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the tool bar as an app@@ endi@@ x .
allows up@@ loading of tool@@ bars to the main server , where anyone else can access it . see in .
loading an &amp; DT@@ D ; you or anyone else has made and convert them to &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; own coating format .
loading / con@@ sens@@ ational of the entities from &amp; DT@@ D ; it makes sense if the entities from &amp; DT@@ EP are to be renewed , without renew the entire &amp; DT@@ EP ; if this global and a write permission is not available in the global K@@ DE folder , the store fails .
this menu contains a list of tags available in the currently loaded tool bar . if the Standard ( HTML ; ) tool bar is loaded , there is a sub @-@ menu standard that contains the list of tags / promotions on this tool@@ bar .
allows access to the current tag dialog , if there is one . this entry is always present in the menu Tags , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menu .
activated or disabled the intelligent inser@@ tion of tags . currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML @-@ DT@@ Ds . it &apos;s currently not working with ( X ) HTML @-@ DT@@ Ds . it &apos;s ref@@ using to add tool bar if this tag does not contra@@ dict the rules this day .
in the plug @-@ ins menu , the available plug @-@ ins are listed among the listed menu options . click on . click the activated plug @-@ ins disabled .
select the syntax high@@ lighting mode for the current file . the list of available mod@@ ulating schem@@ ata depends on der@@ k@@ ate ; -@@ Version .
select the type of Ze@@ il@@ en@@ ende identification . very useful if you know people who use other OS platforms to develop . select Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
checks the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; using the external application T@@ id@@ y .
instant switching between the different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , the change@@ over sometimes need or un@@ beautiful graphics . recommended is the card @-@ card mode , which is also the default settings mode , which corresponds to the display in &amp; quantitative ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu provides an entry for each open sub@@ window . with selection of a request , the corresponding sub@@ window will be activated .
displays the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; quantitative ; main window on or off .
the changes in this dialog influence each application that use the K@@ HTML Part , including the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; web browser .
the behaviour of the editor is based . in the documentation of &amp; Kate ; you will find details .
a dialog appears where you delete records from tool@@ bars or which can add or modify the sequences .
this should create a help according to the setting of the mouse , but is not implemented yet .
&amp; quantitative product ; is a high quality product that is freely available and free licensed , but as with any open source project , developers can always use help . if they want to support &amp; quantum ; development in financial shape , find the way here .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be completed at the top of the project , for example , after completing the project name , complete directory structure for the rest of the project . all these paths and author information fields can be changed later with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties .
here &apos;s the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering from Name , file will be automatically filled .
this is the name of the &amp; quantum le@@ us ; project file . by default it has the name of the project in lower@@ case and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can access the server address of the machine on which one wants to access the local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exempl@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 ) are possible .
if you leave this field empty , the default log settings are used . depending on the remote computer setting , an adaptation could be needed .
this is the folder where the templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default templates . if a common collection of files used for various projects , this folder should be adjusted instead of the standard .
this is the folder where the tool bar is stored for the project . it is a relative path to the Project and by default Tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files used for various projects , this folder should be adjusted instead of the standard .
this allows to add files from the local file system to the project . multiple files or whole folder can be selected .
this setting is great if you want to download and modify the static web content . for ser@@ ver@@ sive scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently .
if files are located somewhere in the main folder of the project , if a project is re @-@ started , it will not be started .
with this option , all files and folders will be displayed inside the main folder and you can make a precise selection according to good .
this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by hook , or by removing the skins , clips from the project .
the last screen of the new project wiz@@ ard contains three settings , which simpli@@ fy your work . these settings can be upload in menu with Project Properties in the menu area Properties or with the Shift Shift ; F@@ 7 .
some settings correspond to those in the project wiz@@ ard and are described in . additional entries are explained below .
a list of file names ( plac@@ eholder are possible ) which will be ignored for project @-@ related operations like Project Fol@@ ders .
additional option to be listed above , even files that are listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ or are excluded from the project .
the project view , which is loaded when opening the project , can be read more about projec@@ tions .
this allows to select the desired de@@ bu@@ gger . currently , only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the de@@ bu@@ gger plug@@ in can be adjusted with the Options button . in this case , the de@@ bug@@ ger can be described .
in the sub@@ window profiles , high load profiles ( see in ) can be specified , as well as the display for the contents of the server for each profile by drawing an own tree view for each profile .
in the sub@@ window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details below .
in the sub@@ window configuration , you can turn event actions and add these actions , change or delete these actions . events are executed if there is a certain event , such as the sigh@@ ting of a file . see the details .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us opens ; the last project that was open . this behavior can currently not be influenced .
to open another project , select Project Open ... from the Project Project or the Symbol Project open from tool@@ bar . the Project Open Project will be displayed and allows selecting a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as extension .
if &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; closed , the project file will be stored automatically . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving if &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; changed files . the same happens when you load a new project .
the project man@@ view gives free access to the files in the project . the files can be managed in the current project .
folder can also be@@ have , however , the entries are opening and opening with ... in the right mouse button to open the context menu :
various profiles can be selected here . the profile contains information on the location of the highly scal@@ able files .
allows removing the current profile . if only a profile is present , the button appears to prevent removing .
the password is kept in the kernel and is forgotten when frequent up@@ loading of files is needed and the rather un@@ reliable password on the disk can not be found in question .
this will stop the transfer or leave the dialog , if you change your mind before up@@ loading .
in &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; many high load profiles can be created and the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog is displayed :
this is the server name server to be copied to the files . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address work .
the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed K@@ io Sl@@ aves . at least you should choose from &amp; ft@@ p ; , file ( locally ) and NFS .
port for transfer . normally this does not have to be changed , except the network administrator runs a service not on the usual port .
depending on your anxiety shaft , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use it according to your discretion . the password will be stored on the disk , so it can &apos;t be easily read , but everyone with programming knowledge can easily be seen .
a project view is just a set of files and tool bars . it can be loaded in a project many views , i.e. by simply Tau@@ be the view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the current open files and tool@@ bars .
views can be stored in the menu or the project tool@@ bar , accessible via Settings tool bar tool@@ bar , opened or deleted .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in which one has most to do . this helps not only increase productivity but also allows the adaptation of &amp; quantitative ; to its own working mode .
as already mentioned above are tool@@ bars in &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; best on tool@@ bars menu bar . use and add materials . the addition of tool@@ bars can be distinguished below in the addition of tool@@ bars .
tool@@ bars and symbols can be set on either by context menu ( right @-@ click on the tool@@ bar , you can set other actions such as tool bar , tool@@ bar or tool@@ bars , which can be specified in the dialog where indicated , which actions on this or other tool bars are to be visible .
by calling the context menu to an action ( symbol ) on a tool@@ bar , the entries will be removed and action worked , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
tool@@ bars and the actions on them can set up menu options in the menu with Settings ... and set Settings .. set .
templates are in fundamental document skel@@ et@@ ons , code schn@@ itz@@ el and files to connect . &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; it is basically used as a usual file system with extended organization and interfaces . you can copy , move or delete each on the system existing directory into the pre@@ dispos@@ es . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in about the restrictions you refer to the file system .
some templates with &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions set before using exactly .
binary is all that is not pur@@ er text , so images , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; bin@@ ary . binary templates are usually included in documents using short@@ cuts ( e.g. pictures with IM@@ G sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples are found in the pre@@ dispos@@ es of global templates . more information about templates is available .
documents can be created by any text document . on basis of these templates , new documents can be created . usually , special documents can be created . usually , you will find a simple framework for the purpose and organis@@ ing work in appropriate manner to be efficient . some examples may be found under global templates . see for more information about the templates tree .
this kind of templates is useful , if not a new document is to be inserted once again on a template , but the same text area again to the documents . you can find it all about a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl . see some examples in the store space under global templates . see for more information about the templates tree .
as the name says , these templates for whole sites serve as templates . they are a collection of different documents which can be organized in a folder structure . there are currently no examples in &amp; quantitative .
create a document structure according to will ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and select File As template save As local template .
once that is done , you notice that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) , the template is not visible in the project tree . look at the project tree under projec@@ tions .
select text in your document and click on File As a template store selecting a local / project template . alternatively , the selection can be easily drawn with pulling and placing on the tree view templates .
the creation of binary templates is simple : the file is only enough to copy the file . all file management functions can be used , such as pulling and inser@@ tion or inser@@ tion over the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or .
you can select a folder on the file tree or in the project files tree view , select a name for the template and secure it . by default , it is stored in the project folder , but of course it can be stored as local or global template .
project templates allow a very target @-@ oriented vor@@ tex . you can create head@@ lines and foot@@ er or dynam@@ ically with &amp; PHP ; create , paste or link them with them . additionally , you can keep some things using templates in projects very deep in the eye .
the template structure in the sub@@ window is based upon the files stored in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps , and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / templates / Quant@@ a / templates / Quant@@ a / templates . each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers , as above .
to specify the behavior of a folder , in the pre @-@ press overview with the right mouse button , click the folder and select in the context menu properties . the following dialog appears :
a drop down sel@@ ector with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is blind@@ folded as soon as mental attributes are ver@@ ted .
this is enabled by default and adap@@ ts everything except the regular folder . if a regular folder would be set out in this path , it would explicitly appear to be explicitly enabled . in the case of a normal folder , the bl@@ ah would appear with something like text module . if nothing appears , it is likely to appear in a regular folder .
allows for@@ warded or displayed text for templates in this folder . this could be a general header or foot@@ er for all templates for a particular project and enabled to copy the contents into a folder with special header lines / foot@@ er to equi@@ p an entire presentation with the appropriate head lines / foot@@ er .
in addition , you have a context menu ( pointing out , right mouse button ) via a complete command collection for adding files or copy and paste from one place to another .
&amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source text editor that is accessed via the menu view . the first mode is replacing the source code in two parts : source code editor and V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : he invites you to edit a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; then you can edit and turn back to the source code editor in which the changes made in the V@@ PL ; editor are visible in the source code .
when working with the V@@ PL ; editor on a document that contains the V@@ PL ; source code . it is not possible to edit this directly to the V@@ PL ; editor . it is not possible to edit this directly to the V@@ PL ; editor is still necessary to change this code . there are no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode works just like the first one , except that at the same time , changes both in the source code editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor is in@@ active , and the cur@@ sor is activated in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; this mode is already active , transm@@ itting the active cur@@ sor from a window to others , where the position is maintained in the document .
the synchron@@ isation distance between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source code editor is set to set up over Settings Quant@@ a . in addition , you can choose between synchron@@ ization according to one click or automatically . in principle , the recommendation can be set automatically after one click or automatically . in principle , the recommendation is required for fast calcul@@ ator and a big sco@@ op for slow motion .
suppose you want to change the title of the website , so it is possible to select the document properties when working with the V@@ PL ; editor is also called when a new document is created using the V@@ PL ; editor . this allows the reduction of the manual body . this allows you to change the following :
met@@ a @-@ tags allow the storage of information about the document itself e.g. , tags for internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below , e.g. keywords on the name and keyword Key@@ word 2 in the contents column .
CSS rules are the new way of designing the pages in your browser . you can add CSS rules to the list or delete CSS properties below the list is exactly as possible with met@@ a @-@ elements . the editing of CSS rules is not currently supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS styl@@ ing by pressing on the File Open button and select the file .
the use of cur@@ s@@ ors is as used in a word processing , due to the arrows , possible . under rare circumstances the cur@@ sor rel@@ ates as usual . text can be inserted as usual . text can be inserted by typ@@ ing and extingu@@ ished with a touch or distance .
inser@@ ting tags will be made in the same way through the tool bar , as in the source code editor , which has already existing identical tags , e.g. if an anchor is inserted , enclosed with text , each other must be removed .
some tool@@ bars such as the tables @-@ assistant or the list@@ ings assistant are disabled . they will later work on &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , the tables or lists of tool@@ bars must be used .

there are many graphical tools for the same . so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain why I wrote .
the merge was very complicated , because one of the workers had made many changes and at the same time had changed the retro@@ fit . another programmer had changed much text in the same file . the result was numerous conflicts in merge .
the program that was used by me did not show me the changed lines , but I could not see what exactly changed within these lines . and there was no evidence of the positions where the result of these changes had been a little night@@ mare .
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could display differences within one line and changes to white characters . later , lots of other useful functions have been added later .
for example , if you want to compare text quickly , simply copy it into the clip@@ board and add it in one of the comparison window .
a function that made a lot of work was the compar@@ ing and merge of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a full file browser .
also 3 @-@ way clas@@ h result is fully supported . this is useful when two persons operate independently of each other on a piece of co@@ de and make changes . in this editor , you can even edit the result . in this editor , you can even process the result directly . in this editor , you can even process the result directly with the result :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; helps you also with the comparison and merge complete file . this screen picture shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in folder merge :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; displays the exact differences and refer to the possibilities of today &apos;s paint monitors . if you need to check co@@ de , you will like this function .
differences in white signs and tab@@ s are visible . when the lines differ only in a certain number of white characters , it can be seen at a glance at the abstract section on the left side . ( no more trouble if no one changes immigration . )
when a file is the same , and the others differ in one line , then the color indicate which file is different . red color means that both files differ .
if all files are the same name , but in different folders , you can ease the typ@@ ing work by writing only the fil@@ en@@ ame of the first file . example :
K@@ diff@@ 3 Fol@@ der 1 folder 2 @-@ o target folders K@@ diff@@ 3 Fol@@ der 1 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder folders
open dialogue offers manual typ@@ ing of fil@@ en@@ ames , selecting a recently opened file from the drop @-@ down list . open your selection and displays them next time ; if you leave the entry for C empty , the analysis of the differences will be performed with two files .
via the button folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the comparison or merge of folders will be selected , for B and C , then a folder , then use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ame from A in the two other folders .
if merge is crossed , the input field will be active for the target and is not necessarily required to specify an output file immediately . you can do this step later when saving .
the setup button opens a dialog with Settings . you can set options before starting with the same / merge .
sometimes you do not want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text box into the active comparison window . when compared , you don &apos;t need to select files from clip@@ board to the active comparison window . in opening dialogue , you will need to close the dialog with the Canc@@ el button .
you can also drag and put off : simply drag a file from one file manager or selected text from one editor and drop it over a comparison window .
what idea is behind it ? sometimes , a file contains several similar functions . if you &apos;d like to find out how much these features , it would be a relatively big effort . you would have to upload two corresponding files , they should be able to copy them in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; now you can copy the relevant sections , insert and then compare .
note : you can get nothing out of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; pull out . only the drop of text into a comparison window is supported .
warning : some editors interpret the drag and tear of text into another program as slic@@ ing and inser@@ tion ( instead of copying and paste ) . in such a case your original data could be lost .
in the upper part of each text window , the info line contains the characters A , B or C , the file name and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window C is optional . ) Each file has a different color . ( if the path is too long , let the mouse take a while above the line . then a small relief window will display the full name . )
the three main sources are the letters A , B and C assigned . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these settings can be changed via the Settings menu . )
when a difference is detected , the color is different . if both files differ , the default color is different . ( colour for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is especially useful when you see three files . that &apos;s in the next section ( merge ) well .
left next to the text is the con@@ gest@@ ion column . when differences are found , the column displays the corresponding color . if there are differences in white characters , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + for example , white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , relevant for the pre@@ processor and in few , rare cases relevant . )
the vertical line , which separates the summar@@ ies from the text , is interrupted on places where the respective source file does not have lines . if the line file is activated , the line is scored .
the result window ( among the comparison list ) also has a info line with the inscription release : , the file name , and &#91; changes &#93; when you have processed the result . usually it contains text , but often it contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts are dissolved , saving is disabled ! ! ! ( use the buttons to find next dissolved / un@@ resolved conflict to find remaining conflicts . )
if only two compar@@ ators are used , each difference should also be solved to manually .
by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows a group will be marked in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed . ( this group will also be highlighted in the current group . ) This group will be highlighted in the current group . it will be highlighted with the color background color for current areas and on the left appears a black beam .
sometimes there is no more line left through automatic clas@@ h or by manual editing . this text is displayed in these lines . this text is only a place for the case that you might change your mind and maybe another source file . this text appears neither in the final saved file , nor in a marking that you might copy and insert somewhere else .
the text &amp; lt ; arran@@ ging together ; however , appears in the clip@@ board if you copy the text from the result window . carefully proceed with this function .
note : if selecting the sources ignore the options , ignore or ignore C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated as white characters .
navigate mainly with the images and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you &apos;re in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys on the left , right , late , C@@ trl @-@ beginning and C@@ trl @-@ end , you can also click on the navigation panel next to the vertical frame rate .
in the eye window you can also use the other keys to edit . using the Add @-@ button , you can switch between plug @-@ in and writ@@ able mode . ( default is the plug @-@ in mode . )
a click with the left mouse button in one of the summar@@ izing columns will synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of the respective group ( as already described in the section and the ed@@ itable output window ) .
the tool bar contains seven buttons to navigation with which you can jump to the current / last difference ( C@@ trl @-@ Down / C@@ trl @-@ Up ) , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ trl @-@ Down / C@@ trl @-@ Down ) or to the next / previous conflict , even after manual de@@ struc@@ tions . hence , between dissolved and un@@ resolved conflicts can be distinguished .
to copy the markings into the clip@@ board , you need to copy the Copy button ( C@@ trl @-@ C or C@@ trl ) . however , it is possible to automatically copy the clip@@ board and manually copy the clip@@ board . be careful with this option , as you acci@@ dentally over@@ write the content of the clip@@ board .
c@@ ash@@ en@@ ings are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix flavors use a line @-@ in line \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems do not use Wag@@ en@@ roll@@ back \ \ r \ . K@@ diff@@ 3 doesn &apos;t re@@ charge the lines of c@@ edar files , therefore you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; nor do not use binary files .
the options and list of the last used files will be stored automatically and restored during the next start . ( menu adjustment &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 )
select a type@@ face with fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog box provides fonts with variable width to choose you should not use them . )
if you activate this option , differences in ital@@ ics are displayed . if the selected font is not supported , nothing happens .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in its pure form but would be displayed . on these systems the button settings will automatically display an odd color .
when this option is enabled , pressing the button key will be inserted into the appropriate number of spaces . otherwise , a tab@@ ulator characters will be inserted .
when you press input or return , the return on the previous line will automatically be used for the next row .
if this option is enabled , each selection will automatically be copied to clip@@ board . manually copy the clip@@ board .
you can select which Ze@@ il@@ en@@ ende type you prefer to store . the default value is the general selection on the operating system used .
when compar@@ ing files attempts &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , all are identical to the source files . only during this first step , white characters can be ignored . the second step is not ignored . in this step , white signs are not ignored . even when merge , white characters are not ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) save a wagon @-@ run &apos; \ &apos; at the end of one line , but other again store only a line slot &apos; \ &apos; . if this option is enabled , however , files with different sizes are visible , but as a white character can be disabled . during the result , this option has to be disabled . in default , this option is disabled .
in default , this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . in the result the differences are displayed , but they are treated like white characters .
in default , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated as changes in white characters .
inten@@ sely search for even smaller differences . the option is activated in default . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slowly with very large files .
in the automatic transmission mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed , before the next un@@ resolved conflict continues .
automatic all conflicts in white characters dis@@ sol@@ ves the selected file as source . ( pre@@ set is manual selection . ) It is useful if you need to use the automatic selection in many files , then use the automatic selection of conflicts in numbers or comments if the options ignore or ignore the options or ignore C / C + + comments .
these options are discussed in the chapter to scan folders and exec@@ uting a merger . look for details below documentation for directory comparison and merge .
if a file is saved and already an older version exists , then the original version is the suff@@ ix .@@ original file . if there is already such backup file with the suff@@ ix .@@ file exists , it will be deleted without further backup .
fits the language of the user interface . this option does not concern the current running program . you need to stop and re@@ boot , so that the change is active . ( this option is not available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; it is not available because the language will be globally controlled via the control centre . )
the following code settings can be set separately for each entry . if you activate this option , the top setting is used for all entries .
over the selection fields for coding , a brief indication of what the local coding is . ( this cannot be changed here and has a purely inform@@ al character . )
adjust the file code encoding for source files . this influences such as special characters and interpret . as the coding for each file is individually adjustable , even files with different coding can be compared and merged .
if you have edited a file , you can specify which coding is to be used for saving .
if you define pre @-@ processing commands , you may not work with your code c . ( for example , if your files can work 16 @-@ bit Unicode , but the pre @-@ processing command can only handle 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can set the coding of output commands .
turn off this off to supp@@ ress any changes in white characters in text or review . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options are ignore or ignore C / C + + comments . )
this selection is only available when you see three files . in normal mode , you may see only the differences between two of three files . according to selection from A &amp; lt ; B , A &amp; B ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C is displayed in addition to the normal still another second column column with the information required .
sometimes you want to use the available space on the screen for long lines . simply finish the less important window . ( this option is in the window menu . )
arrange the comparison window by side by side or over@@ lap . this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes you will consider the differences and then decide to merge the files . if you &apos;re using only two files . one simple click starts to merge operation and use the fil@@ en@@ ame of the last source file as the default name for the output file . ( if this function is used to start merge again , then the name of the last used output file will be maintained . )
when reading a file it will first pass this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can use your own pre@@ processor . you can use this function for example to remove inter@@ fere parts or to correct the input .
when reading a file , it will first be handed over to this external command ( see above ) , then the output command is used only when the output command is used . you can write your own pre@@ processor . each input line must have an associated issue line .
the idea behind it is to enable the user more flexibility when setting the di@@ ff results . however , an external program is needed , and most users don &apos;t want to program it yourself . the good news is , however , that in most cases it suff@@ ice or per@@ l perfectly sufficient .
if you use this pre @-@ processing command for Ze@@ il@@ en@@ ab@@ orted to input the input in upper@@ case letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ U \ \ 1 / &apos; This . * is an erg@@ ent expression of on any string . \ \ 1 in the tool string refers to the found text in the first brackets . the \ \ U converts the found text in upper@@ case letters .
CVS and other version control systems use some key words to automatically add generated characters ( info : / c@@ vs / keyword \ \ _ BAR _ file \ \ _ BAR _ file \ \ _ BAR _ file \ \ _ BAR _ file \ \ _ BAR _ file \ \ _ BAR _ file \ \ _ BAR _ file \ \ _ BAR _ file \ \ _ BAR _ file \ \ _ BAR _ file \ \ _ BAR _ file \ \ _ BAR _ file \ \ _ BAR _ file \ \ _ BAR _ file \ \ _ BAR _ file \ \ _ BAR _ file \ \ _ BAR _ file \ \ _ BAR _ file \ \ _ BAR _ file \ \ _ BAR _ file \ \ _ BAR _ file \ \ _ BAR _ file \ \ _ BAR _ file \ \ _ BAR _ file \ \ _ BAR _ file \ \ _ BAR _ file \ \ _ BAR _ file \ \ _ BAR _ file \ \ _ BAR _ file \ \ _ BAR _ file \ \ _ BAR _ file \ \ _ BAR _ file \ \ _ BAR _ file \ \ _ BAR _ file \ \ _ BAR _ file \ \ _ BAR _ file \ \ _ BAR _ file \ \ _ BAR _ file \ \ _ BAR _ file \ \ _ BAR _ file \ \ _ BAR _ file \ \ _ BAR _ file \ \ _ BAR _ file \ \ _ BAR _ file \ \ _ BAR _ file \ \ _ BAR _ file \ \ _ BAR _ file \ \ _ BAR _ file \ \ _ BAR _ file \ \ _ BAR _ file \ \ _ BAR _ file \ \ _ BAR _ file \ \ _ BAR _ file \ \ _ BAR _ file \ \ _ BAR _ file \ \ _ BAR _ file \ \ _ BAR _ file \ \ _ BAR _ file \ \ _ BAR _ file \ \ _ BAR _ file \ \ _ BAR _ file \ \ _ BAR _ file \ \ _ BAR _ file \ \ _ BAR _ file \ \ _ BAR _ file \ \ _ BAR _ file \ \ _ BAR _ file \ \ _ BAR _ file \ \ _ BAR _ file \ \ _ BAR _ file \ \ _ BAR _ file \ \ _ BAR _ file \ \ _ BAR _ file \ \ _ BAR _ file \ \ _ BAR _ file \ \ _ BAR _ file \ \ _ BAR _ file \ \ _ BAR _ file \ \ _ BAR _ file \ \ _ BAR _ file \ \ _ BAR _ file \ \ _ BAR _ file \ \ _ BAR _ file \
while you experiment with sed , you may start to understand it and maybe like this regular expres@@ sions . they are very useful because there are many programs supporting very similar things .
the ignor@@ ing of numbers is actually a built @-@ in function in K@@ diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example of a further pre @-@ processing command for c@@ il@@ en@@ ab@@ le@@ . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Every letter between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a match , so any hits will be replaced by nothing .
sometimes you might want to perform multiple requirements at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the compositions . example :
instead of sed you can also use something different such as per@@ l . per@@ l -@@ e -@@ e &apos;@@ S / RE@@ G@@ EX@@ P / replacement / switch &apos; Ho@@ wever , per@@ l needs some details different . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) needs per@@ l only ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data after the normal processor be maintained for viewing and merge . further operations change only the data that the Ze@@ il@@ en@@ ab@@ orted al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ m sees .
note : in rare cases when you use a normal processor processor , the line @-@ in pre@@ processor is the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input .
the pre @-@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function , the text changes or differences , you can &apos;t notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case .
often , program@@ mers need to edit many files . for this reason , you can compare and merge with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folder recur@@ sively and result .
... makes a suggestion for each object ; you can adjust the proposal before starting ,
... can sim@@ ulate the merge and sim@@ ulate the sim@@ ulated changes without really performing it ,
... selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) or only with the selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is very similar to the compar@@ ing and merge of individual files . you just have to specify a folder on the command line or in the dialog file .
if three folders will be merged , then folder 1 is used as base . if no destination folder is specified , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as target folders .
note that only the comparison of folders will not start the merge . to start merge , you must select the corresponding menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( further details follow . )
during reading the folder , you will inform a little news window about the current progress . if you dis@@ rup@@ ture the file , only the files are listed until then .
if the folder is complete , displays &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a window window with the results on the left , ...
each file and folder that has been found during the scan , is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is usually folded together . you can fold a folder by clicking on the + / - click on the property or by clicking the arrow keys for left / right . the directory menu has two functions . fold in the folder and fold all sub@@ directories with which you can open all the folders .
if you double click on a file , the file is launched and a comparison window appears .
the icon in column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) again . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in other folders , it is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detail pane to the selected object . in such a case , the plug @-@ in action cannot be chosen automatically . if the merge is started , you will be informed about problems of this type .
as shown in the above picture , in the columns A / B / C the colors are red , green , yellow and black .
however , with identical entries the colour is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different .
folders are considered to be the same as their overall content is identical . then , file the same color . in case of folders , the age is in@@ significant for its color .
the idea of this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . colours reflect the colors of a sheet , which is only green , then yellow becomes yellow and later when it is old , red becomes .
... A and C are identical but not B : copying B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A and B are identical but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... B and C are identical but not A : copy of A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A , B and C not have the same file type ( e.g. when A a file and B is a file ) : error : contradic@@ tory file types . as long as such faul@@ tless objects exist , the merge cannot be started .
... A and B do not have the same data type ( e.g. when A a file and B is a file ) : error : contradic@@ tory file types . as long as such faul@@ tless objects exist , the merge cannot be started .
the mode for synchron@@ izing is active , if only two folders and no explic@@ it target folder were specified . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the required action , so that both folders are identical . if for an entry ...
... A and B exist but not identical : to result together and save the result in both folders . ( the user looks as the visible fil@@ en@@ ame for output file only B ; directly after arran@@ ging it &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B by A. )
if two folders can be merged and select the new file instead of merge ( in@@ secure ) , then the date of files and suggests the newer file . if the files are different , but the date is identical . if the files are different , but the date is identical .. Sol@@ ange cannot be removed , the merge may not be started .
during the merge , a file will be processed after the others . status column shows far , and correspon@@ d@@ ingly other messages , if something unexpected , you should make a last review and see if the status is all right .
when the alignment dialog is selected , K@@ Diff@@ 3 is selected further columns . these contain the number of un@@ solved , dissolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for dissolved conflicts is only displayed when three folders compared or merged . )
you can either lead the selected entry ( file or odds ) , or all entries at one time . if you have selected all together @-@ feeding actions ( even in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start the merge .
please note : if you do not have a destination folder , then in the three @-@ file merge mode C is used as the target for selecting the two @-@ file merge , A and / or B is used as target .
if you have chosen a destination folder , please check if all entries are to be displayed in the folder structure . there are some options to be ski@@ pped in the folder structure . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises :
to bring all the entries , select directory to merge / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the key symbol ) . to execute just the current record : select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if any conflic@@ ting file types still exist still invalid merge actions , a message appears on the defective elements . you can then select a valid action .
when you merge all entries , a dialog window appears with the options flow , embar@@ king and inter@@ rupt .
please ti@@ fy if you want to see what would happen without the really changes . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then performs certain actions with all entries . if a manual procedure is required ( merge a single file ) , then a merge window will open ( note the screen picture ) .
if you &apos;re done with a file , select again directory entry / continue , or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved , a corresponding dialog appears . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , his work will continue with the next entry .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on a mistake , a message appears and detailed status information . at the end of the list , you will see some error messages that will help you try to skip the cause of the problem . if you proceed to retri@@ eve the cause of the problem or to solve the problem of the problem , before you proceed with the merge .
if some entries were individually merged , re@@ members &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and over@@ run them together . even if the merge operation was performed or not saved , these entries are considered to be performed . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged again .
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 set up ... ) now has a section called folder merge with these options :
only files that fit the specified patterns will be displayed in the element tree . separate the pattern with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders do not have to match this pattern .
files and folders which correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be set more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ o .
files and folders which correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be set more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ o .
ignored files that would also be ignored by CVS . the big advantage is that this folder can be set specifically with a .@@ c@@ v@@ signal file . ( look at info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some file systems , files have a default attribute . in other file systems , a previous point is marked as hidden . this option lets you decide whether these files are displayed in the element tree or not . this option is turned on in default .
with links to files : when the option is disabled , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files are compared to which the links are disabled . this is disabled by default .
with links to folders : when the option is turned off , links like normal folder will be checked and recur@@ sively searches . ( note that the links will lead to a loop , and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; crash@@ es . ) This option is disabled by default .
a complete analysis of each file carries out and shows the statistics of statistics . ( the number of dissolved , un@@ - white and white conflicts . ) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and significantly slow@@ ed if they contain no text . ( enter an appropriate anti @-@ pattern ) .
if you compare great folders through a slow network , it may vary faster , only the change date and file size . however , it costs a certain level of safety . please check with caution . this option is checked in the default .
similar to a change date . there is no real comparison . the files are considered to be identical , if it is equally important when copying the Change date . please check with caution . this option is checked in the default .
activ@@ ating the synchron@@ ising mode when two folders are compared and no target folder is specified . in this mode , the proposals are identical to the merge . also , the results from the merge of files are stored in both folders . this option is disabled in default .
in case there are differences , instead of merge the newer file is suggested as an action . ( this is considered in@@ secure , because it is considered in@@ sure that the other file is not altered as well . you should check this in any case . ) This option is disabled in default .
if a file or a file is replaced or deleted by another file , then the original version will be renamed . if an old backup file is already existing , this will also be deleted without further backup . this option also applies to normal interaction . this option is enabled in default .
normally , the folder merge view remains visible to the merge of individual files ; you can disable the window divider over the window . if you don &apos;t want to set the windows &amp; text window , turn the windows &amp; text window between the two views .
probably you prefer to compare a file just with double @-@ click . however , there is a single file directly connected without having to start the folder . after you save the result , the status will be done directly and the file will not run again when you start the folder .
however , this status is lost when you read the directory again : directory menu : re @-@ read
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ io slaves . K@@ diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders to open on local or remote computers .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one FTP server . the second command line re@@ sembles a folder inside a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax as local files and folders . a few things should be considered :
a path can contain relatively small or .. included . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute .
special characters must be mass@@ aged . ( # - &gt; % 23 , spaces show - &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes because of the file system on the server , sometimes through the protocol used . it follows a short list of limitations :
or it can not be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows . then , a file is accepted as a link finish . ( FTP : , S@@ FTP : ) .
there is no way to edit author@@ ization or change date . therefore , the per@@ missions or change date are made from the original . ( note that this option is only possible with local files ) .
the main reason for this purpose is currently as the difference @-@ viewer in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op starts to start the built @-@ in differences viewer . to start K@@ diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button and then select in K@@ diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu .
normally needs &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . if it is applied as a part , take &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the names of the original files from the patch file . at least one of the two files must exist . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the patch to restore the missing file .
in the context menu , you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . also , please note that if none of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable when the original files have changed since generation of patch file .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it only supports the comparison of two files , a very small tool bar and menu . the merge or comparison of folders is not supported in the K@@ Part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ diff@@ 2 ( now it &apos;s comp@@ pare ) are already available . furthermore , the name K@@ diff@@ 3 is already pointing out that it can merge together like the diff@@ 3 program from the di@@ ff utility collection .
I use GPL @-@ programs very long and have learned a lot in the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all program@@ mers who have gone this way or going to go so .
you have compiled the program from the sources and probably not disclos@@ ed the correct pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in the default run configure in / us@@ r / local , but then K@@ DE could not find resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file you will find further information on this subject .
if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are first treated as identical , but if only one non @-@ white character is different , the line will be treated as not identical . i@@ F is the lines of next to each other , this car@@ is co@@ incidence as the case .
the editor is noticeable for any difference in the files where it begins and where he ends . this important information is simply lost when clicking into the source code and select the button A / B / C , and it is too much effort to design extra a private file format that could save this information .
the cost for this has been too large so far . you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C . to process large quantities of text , another editor should be used .
after removing text is suddenly lt ; No sr@@ c left ; published , and the lyrics cannot be extingu@@ ished . what does that mean and how can it be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; use many colors to emphas@@ ize differences . even more emphasis would be conf@@ using and mis@@ lacking the purpose . please use another editor .
many good ideas and trou@@ bles@@ hooting came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or later .
information on how to use K@@ diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
a list of recent changes can be found under htt@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ angel@@ og or in the file Ch@@ angel@@ og in the Qu@@ ell package .
to comp@@ ile and install &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; to comp@@ ile and install , use the following command in the basic folder of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; -@@ Distribution :
K@@ DE @-@ dir gives the folder to your system installed in which K@@ DE is installed . if you are uns@@ ure , you will find further details in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file .
da &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake use , you should not have problems with comp@@ ile . if difficulties are encountered , please report on the &amp; k@@ de ; Mail@@ ing lists thereof .
cut out ( C@@ trl @-@ X or Shift @-@ Rem@@ ove ) into the clip@@ board and delete the selected text . insert the text from the clip@@ board at the current cur@@ sor position or replaces the current marking .
only differences : files that are identical in all folders are not appear in the folder structure and thus also not in the target folder .
( in the current program version you need to update the folder with the function refresh to these options . )
there are only entries to show the differences . this also causes identical files to merge in the target folder . if the target folder does not contain these files , they are missing after the merge . ( the behavior is probably modified in a later program version . ) This option is disabled in default .
note the buttons to choose from the source with lab@@ eling A , B and C below the menu bar . if you &apos;re on one of the buttons , the lines are attached to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if the lines are already present ) , they will be back to the button in the button .
in default , this option is disabled . under@@ scores in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated as differences in white characters .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; displays a miniature preview of all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . it is quite convenient to change the running programs on the working areas to stop her size or move them . this works in both a desktop and with several .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual work@@ spaces as well as running applications . applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and at other .
with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager . movement is possible in both a desktop and other working areas .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse click is clicked on , if on the empty background of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; clicked on , the context menu has to set up only the two entries P@@ ager . if , on an application within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager . if you click on an application within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager . if you click on an application within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager . if you click on an application within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager . if you click on an application within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager . if you click on a log file , the name and the entries will appear , maxim@@ ize , on desktop and refer@@ ing . commands include the following :
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of desktop . appears only if clicked on an application .
sends the application to select the selected virtual desktop . only appears if clicked on an application .
if this check box is marked , windows can be moved inside &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop , and also on other areas of work .
when this field is crossed , the name of the virtual work@@ space will be displayed in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager .
cross the rim of this field makes the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; show the numbers of virtual work@@ space . if it is crossed with name , the names are indicated with ord@@ inal numbers , &amp; eg ; 1 . desktop .
if this field is crossed , the background of each desktop is also displayed as a background in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager .
if this field is crossed , the running programs are displayed as small windows at &amp; k@@ p@@ ager . otherwise , only empty working areas are displayed to allow their selection .
here the view of the program window is selected . simple right corner with the propor@@ tions of the program window . symbol shows the window with its standard symbol and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the real program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here the arrangement of the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; main windows can be determined : classi@@ cally moved &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ n @-@ grid , all virtual workplace will appear in a horizontal row and per@@ pen@@ dic@@ ular in a vertical row , which is very good for viewing on the side of the desktop .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager Mini@@ program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , window as symbols or with its content . furthermore , it runs outside the control bar .
click the right mouse button within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; then set up a switch from the switch ... lets the dialog box appear .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very powerful application enhanced by new features constantly . it is optimized for use on powerful computers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you boot , start a window as pictured above . the main window of &amp; k@@ mag ; displays the enlarged area of the screen . in the following , this window appears as a magni@@ fication window . the image that is displayed in the magni@@ fication window is a larger area of the screen and is described in the following as select window .
in the default setting is magni@@ fied &amp; k@@ able ; the area around the mouse cur@@ sor , such as an mov@@ able magni@@ fying glass . alternatively , you can display a selected screen area in the magni@@ fication window ( selection mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse button at the screen ( eg ; on the left edge of the screen ) .
if you want to avoid the mouse cur@@ sor in the enlarged window , select the mouse cur@@ sor position . please note that &amp; k@@ not ; currently not able to detect the form of the mouse . this is always the default k@@ night ; / Q@@ t ; mouse poin@@ ter .
in the drop @-@ window mode you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrows and buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way :
move the mouse cur@@ sor in the magni@@ fication window and hold the left mouse button pressed , so you can catch the contents of the magni@@ fication window and move it into the arrow keys .
in addition , when you move the &amp; Shift key , press or select the &amp; M@@ MB ; you can move the selection window .
this combination allows you to change the size of the selection window . note that the upper left corner of the drop @-@ down stand remains and only the lower right corner to move .
&amp; k@@ mag ; possesses a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer to copy in into a file to copy it into other applications ( to turn it into other applications ) , turn the picture and much more .
starts or stops the update process . the stop of the update causes that the needed CPU time goes against 0 .
select the Update Rate ( Very low , Ger@@ ing , Medium , H@@ och , Very high ) . the higher the Update Rate , the more CPU time is required .
in this mode a selection window will be shown . the selected area is displayed in a window .
&amp; k@@ not ; uses automatically your set @-@ files to store files , opening a new window , print , re@@ loading ( with the Button Document again , in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , En@@ large and Ver@@ c@@ ant &amp; etc ; .
k@@ not also known as &amp; k@@ ron@@ fier ; it is a screen saver . you can use &amp; k@@ ron@@ fier ; in addition , you can use a magni@@ fier to view the cl@@ add@@ ess in a newspaper or a photo . this application is for various people of use : from resear@@ ching or artist to web designer or visually imp@@ aired .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse click once the mouse poin@@ ter is waiting for a while on the same place . it is intended to help people suffering from the RS@@ I syndrome ( repet@@ itive Stra@@ in @-@ In@@ jury Syndrome ) and to which each mouse click pain prepar@@ es .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse click once the mouse cur@@ sor is waiting for a while at the same place . it is intended to help people suffering pain in the repet@@ itive penalty of In@@ jury ( RS@@ I ) . furthermore , it can em@@ ulate the pulling with the mouse . however , this requires little exercise .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain , which is created when clicking the mouse , can also cause a lot of people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , you suffer from pain , which are related to using your computer , if this is not done yet .
in order to clari@@ fy it again : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; p@@ ains can help when clicking with the mouse , it is against pain , which is caused by moving the mouse , useless and as with all ergonomic aux@@ iliary means : the result can be different for each different .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and leads a mouse click as soon as you break the movement briefly .
is the intelligent shift activ@@ ates , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a break , wait until the end of the move , wait until the end of the move , before leaving the mouse button . on this way , you can drag the drawing at an impressive button , but you get used to get a little practice , but you get used to it quickly .
this time period must be stored after the end of the mouse motion , before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; click a mouse click .
is Intel@@ li@@ gent@@ es move on , turning the turn@@ out time ( 1 / 10 s ) , the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after shut@@ down the mouse button , before it comes back the mouse button , if there is no result of the mouse .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now supports clicking on the right and back , followed by a break , a click with the right mouse button . a slow moving backwards . these movements are stored in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ kes@@ .@@ txt for the first time , but they can be changed later .
when the sound appears slow@@ ed , you can &amp; k@@ de ; to move the response time . open the Sound &amp; Multimedia , select the Sound System and here the tab General . there , you can set the sound system and here the tab General . there , you can set a lower value in order to reduce the response times .
if this setting is selected , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool should start ; at any start of &amp; k@@ de ; when this function is only available at &amp; k@@ de ; please refer to the respective documentation to find out how you automatically start a program .
put all settings back to the values when opening the dialog . have you already pressed the button users , the settings are reset to the level after pressing the dialog .
best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with the pres@@ ets . in particular , the intelligent move should be turned off at first . if you got used to automatic click , you may later take the smart move .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to decrease the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; at sounds .
first of all , you should make aware of what places a mouse click without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or on places in the browser window that cannot park a link , so you can park the mouse in such places until you want to use them again .
if your mouse bra@@ ck@@ les , you should clean your mouse . it is normally quite simple . the trick is that you can not only clean the mouse ball , but also the roles , which come into contact with the mouse ball .
first , you need to remove the mouse ball . as this happens , mouse to mouse is different , but it should be quickly clear if you &apos;re looking at the bottom of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the roles . these are located on the sides of the hole , into which the ball was used . dirt and so@@ iling are easily scrat@@ ched with a flat blade or your fing@@ ern@@ ails .
in very rare situations the operating system interrup@@ ts the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you use smart shi@@ fts in this case , it means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; surgery is no longer able to exit the mouse button .
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use a window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem is that you carry out a mouse click . this is the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; return and you can continue to work as usual .
problem : when you enter a text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to run mouse clicks and set the cur@@ sor in another place .
solution : use mouse to place the cur@@ sor to place where you want to make it . but you can &apos;t park your mouse on a neutral area of desktop , if you are not able to cause any of the mouse poin@@ ter . secure zones for the mouse poin@@ ter are &amp; eg ; the grey areas around the tool@@ bar and menus and the windows of windows .
I try to work with smart shi@@ fts , but I don &apos;t create it to edit text .
the intelligent move is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can handle it and move it into the clip@@ board to move it into the clip@@ board , or to move it into the clip@@ board . but it will probably cause them to cause problems . here are some advice :
do not use intelligent shi@@ fts , if you just start to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; to use . select text instead : guide the mouse cur@@ sor to the other end of the text , and press the mouse button again .
use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this makes every time when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse clicks is played a sound like a mouse click . so you know exactly when smart shi@@ fts starts to use it without the audi@@ ble mouse click . however , it requires some exercise .
to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X window ; it should be installed on most of the system .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available when the system has a sound card and speakers , and it is correct .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; activ@@ ates the mouse button as soon as the mouse cur@@ sor is briefly stopped . this program was developed for people who suffer from the RS@@ I syndrome , to which the people of the bri@@ ghtest pain is prepared .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured so that there is a certain time waiting for a pulling procedure before the mouse button begins . in this way , pulling and off with the mouse can also be performed .

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program with the dum@@ b user can let her computer speak for himself .
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth ; you can leave a dum@@ b user to speak the computer for itself . the user can choose from a list of the topic sets , which should be spoken again .
the first page of the wiz@@ ard ( left screen@@ shot ) enter the command that will later be used for the voice @-@ over@@ s . further details can be found in the description of the introduc@@ tory dial@@ ogs .
on the second page you can choose the standard text audio book . you can choose to edit text passages , without having to type it . the passages passages can of course be processed .
on the third side ( right screen ) determine the word for the Wor@@ ter@@ ial . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the selected language to determine the frequency of the individual words . in addition , you can also read the word@@ lists using an Open@@ Off@@ ic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to pass the words only correctly .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and contains basically an input field for the key@@ presses of your sentences ( the lower white field in the screen picture ) and a ver@@ aging memory of the already spoken Phr@@ ases ( the upper white field in the screen ) .
if you k@@ mouth ; correct , you can enter the phrases you want . each spoken sentence is attached to the memory . you can choose the sentences which are to be spoken again .
with the Settings menu k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the settings dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; . this dialog contains two card cards , voice output and settings , the side of the word and the K@@ TT@@ SD speech .
in the box card voice output , enter the command to enter the language generator . in the drop @-@ down box , place the character encoding , with text to the language generator .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . choose the check box if the text should be distributed as standard input to the language generator .
if the check box is not selected , the text is passed as a parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholder :
of course , the command to voice messages depends on your language generator . this command can be found in the documentation to your language generator . examples are available in App@@ endi@@ x .
with as a language service as a language service , &amp; k@@ mouth ; as the first try to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . if that is successful , the other settings will be developed on this page . the kt@@ on , the &amp; k@@ de ; applications require a standardized interface for voice output . the choice of this option is sensible , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first selection field action following the selection of a text passage , determine which action is triggered by the button short@@ cut or by choosing a text passage in the text password @-@ book or in the bar for Text@@ pass@@ ag@@ enb@@ ücher .
with the selection of So@@ on , the selected text passage will be spoken directly and additionally inserted into the storage memory . with the selection of In the input field , the selected text passage is only entered into the input field .
with the second drop @-@ down closing window , you can specify if the text audio book will be stored automatically when closing the edit window .
with the selection of Text passages , the book is stored . if you choose changes , the text log book will not be stored . select &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text log book is to be saved .
the Wor@@ ter@@ restri@@ ction page contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for Wor@@ ter@@ istics . in the main window at the input field , &amp; k@@ mouth ; a sel@@ ector field , if this list contains more than a dictionary . with this drop @-@ down sel@@ ector , you can choose the currently used dictionary .
with buttons right on the side you can remove dic@@ tion@@ aries or add the order of the books or export them into a file . below the list , you can set the name and select language for the dictionary .
select the desired language ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the &amp; k@@ de ; reads the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation . in addition , compare the frequency list with an Open@@ Off@@ ic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to add just right @-@ written words into the new dictionary .
with this option you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; then asks which dic@@ tion@@ aries are taken together , and how they are weigh@@ ted .
with this option , you specify a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly entered dictionary automatically generate a dictionary with your vocab@@ ulary over time .
the main window of the window for processing text pass@@ ers is two @-@ divided . in the upper part , the text pass@@ a@@ eg@@ s are displayed as tree structure .
in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change text passage or the corresponding slot cuts . if you have selected a text password , you can only change its name .
actions such as new text passages , or books , or delete selected text passages and books can be accessed either via the selection in the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar or via a drop @-@ down menu .
you can change the order of text pass@@ ers or text passages with the mouse to the new place or with the arrow keys and the Alt ; -@@ key .
the selected text is cut out and copied into the clip@@ board . if in the input field a text section is selected , this is used , otherwise the selected areas of the box .
the selected text is copied to the clip@@ board . if in the input field a text section is selected , this is used , otherwise the selected areas of the box .
the moment@@ ary set is spoken . if text in the input field is used , this is used , otherwise the selected sets of the transfer rate .
if this menu entry is crossed , a shift tool@@ bar is displayed using buttons for frequently used commands . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and drag the tool bar can be moved to another place .
if this menu entry is crossed , a narrow cone in the lower part of the main window with hints on the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; displayed if not crossed , this status bar is hidden .
if this menu entry is crossed , there is a sli@@ p@@ able bar code with entries . the bar is mounted directly below the tool@@ bar . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and drag the tool bar can be moved to another place .
probably you have entered the command for the voice output correctly or not fully entered . set Settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... , open the page General Settings and enter the command for voice output on the box card speech output . ( see settings dialog for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers for further details . )
Festival is a voice @-@ over@@ s of the Edinburgh University . currently only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh are currently supported . license allows to use the festival free of charge and distributed without restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that Festival is installed in the / us@@ r / local / festival file . the order for voice output is then :
Free@@ T@@ TS is an in &amp; Java ; written language generator . currently it supports only the English pron@@ unci@@ ation . the license allows to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free and distributed without restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for the creation of the voice output , the Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / us@@ r / local / p@@ iti@@ y folder , then the voice output is possible with one of the three following commands :
for the third example , the option must be switched on as default input . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es to a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to use the text in phon@@ em@@ es . license allows you to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert German text to MB@@ RO@@ LA , under the assum@@ ption that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / us@@ r / local / hadi@@ fax and / us@@ r / local / mb@@ ro@@ la .
unfortunately H@@ adi@@ fax happily swallowed the last sign of the text , so that an additional character must be added . therefore , the full command is more elabor@@ ate than in the other examples :
( Cat - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BAR _ / us@@ r / local / Fur@@ fax / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f / us@@ r / local / mb@@ ro@@ la / de@@ 1 / / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav ; art@@ spl@@ ay / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav
all parts of the command must be written in a line . the option to send data as a default input must be switched on .
the voice @-@ dem@@ on of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; further language service that provides all &amp; kiss ; applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various voice @-@ over@@ s systems .
as the adjustment of the voice generator is done only in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you just need to use as a language service as language service in &amp; k@@ mouth ; set .
to setup you use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service , which appears in the settings dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; successfully use a voice generator ( and naturally &amp; k@@ de ; 3.x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB memory ( and additionally memory for the language generator ) , but it depends on your computer and configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application that can &apos;t talk to the people who can &apos;t speak lyrics by the calcul@@ ator . there is a list already spoken pro@@ positions that users can keep ane@@ w again .
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no language syn@@ thesizer includes . on the computer a voice syn@@ thesizer must be installed .

&amp; kt@@ ops ; - The voice @-@ over@@ s of &amp; k@@ de ; - is an existing service that allows any application to read text via the &amp; D@@ Bus ; -@@ Interface .
&amp; kt@@ ops ; is a sub@@ system in &amp; k@@ de ; for voice output ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common application interface for &amp; k@@ de ; program@@ mers ready to be equipped with their applications with T@@ TS capabilities . also , users provide interesting options .
read texts ( or parts thereof ) in the text editor &amp; Kate ; even if &amp; Kate ; embedded in other &amp; k@@ gs ; applications embedded .
speech output is done via the speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher program , the various background program such as es@@ peak , festival , &amp; etc ; .
allows production of language spending on the command line ( or with shell scripts ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; -@@ aux@@ iliary program .
in Z@@ UK@@ UN@@ FT : support for Speech @-@ Mark@@ up languages like Vo@@ ice@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Speech Mark@@ up Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and Speech @-@ Mark@@ up @-@ Language ( SM@@ ML ) .
the voice @-@ over@@ s service of &amp; k@@ de ; , an application without visible windows , the T@@ TS services via &amp; D@@ Bus ; offers .
an application with &amp; GUI ; for configuration and setting of kt@@ ts@@ d over kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr in the system section .
a module for the web browser &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; for reading the texts of a web page or share of it .
a module for the text editor &amp; Kate ; , with which a text file can be read entirely or partially .
in addition to the Bug@@ z@@ illa database of &amp; k@@ de ; ( htt@@ p : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) you can find the list above htt@@ ps : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / mail@@ man / k@@ de @-@ Acc@@ essibility . the developers can also be found at IR@@ C ( ir@@ c.@@ k@@ de@@ .org , channel # k@@ de @-@ Acc@@ essibility ) .
before you are able to use , please install program speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher and set correctly . see also
while the first start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr or as long as no speaker is set up , the card @-@ card is displayed . see also . if you have at least one speaker , the card tab will be shown in general . see .
most T@@ TS syn@@ thesizer offer various languages and voices , as well as different male or female , or those that can be set up in volume or speed . you should also set up multiple variants for a syn@@ thesizer . you should at least set up one speaker before you &amp; t@@ ts ; because the program speed disp@@ at@@ cher is used otherwise the standard speaker .
several speakers for the same syn@@ thesizer are comparable with several fe@@ eders for the same printer .
when you click on the speaker , the speaker is shown in kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr , the cartridge will appear automatically , and then it will be automatically set up when you start t@@ sm@@ gr and not have a speaker installed .
all actors have already appear in this list . the preferred speaker will appear above in the list . the top speaker is used for voice output when an application does not appear .
with a mouse click a speaker from the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list .
select a mouse click on the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below .
with a mouse click a speaker from the list , and click on this button to push the speaker on the list a line further down . the order of speakers in the list also determines its priority .
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; kt@@ ops ; system .
select a voting type here , there are three male and three female voices as well as a jun@@ k and girls to choose from .
when you click here , the new spokes@@ man appears on the map tab . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit .
now you can go and go almost . go back to the map tab and check if the speech output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) , so that the T@@ TS service is enabled by &amp; k@@ de ; see . now , you can use &amp; link ; click on the map orders to create and manage text entries . see .
if you have set up at least one speaker , you can start the voice output system by &amp; k@@ de ; click on the tab card General to open this card card . here you can set some general options .
mark this check box to activate the &amp; kt@@ t system . this will start the K@@ DE @-@ T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) , and you can create text orders , and you can read and read text orders , see K@@ TT@@ SD and the T@@ TS @-@ system of &amp; k@@ de ; de@@ activated .
when kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is termin@@ ated , goes on &amp; go ; continue to enable the field ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
if this check box is marked and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr it appears automatically in the system range of control bar , it dis@@ appears once the reading is complete .
with buttons in this series , you can start text applications , stop , stop and return .
with buttons in this series you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; clip@@ board read or read a text file to read . you can also switch the speakers for an order .
click on User or OK , then all changed settings will be adopted on all sides .
the card orders will only be displayed when K@@ TT@@ SD is started . in order to launch K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the tab card General and check the voice output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser from &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed web page . then check the text that will be read . after a short time , select the voice output .
it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a web site . you can also skip this step but then many &amp; HTML ; line @-@ line and other invisible brands are also read .
in &amp; Kate ; the Advanced text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the displayed text . then check out if &amp; go ; go . then mark the text that will be read before , and then select the text output . then , the voice output should start .
this also works if &amp; Kate ; embedded in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Quant@@ a ; .
K@@ Not@@ ify is the message system of &amp; k@@ de ; you can read about it from you . you can read the text of these messages also by &amp; kt@@ ts ; read .
in &amp; conversation , the IR@@ C program of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can set up different types of messages . you can set up &amp; conversation ; for example , set up different types of messages , such as set up in an IR@@ C channel , where your nickname is present . with &amp; t@@ ts ; you can then read the IR@@ C message text .
supports a &amp; kiss ; program K@@ Not@@ ify , a menu entry not@@ if@@ ications in the Settings menu of this program . the possible settings for K@@ Not@@ ify may vary depending on application .
filter for strings provide a good option in &amp; kt@@ ops ; incorrect or incorrect news correct . the file k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml , which is a good example . you removes the tags b@@ r and b from the messages sent by mail , and also the expression / local / in@@ box , as it can be accepted as provided . read also .
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; kt@@ on ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
in fil@@ tering , text is edited before he is sent to program speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful for improving pron@@ unci@@ ation to replace wron@@ g@@ ly spoken words or short@@ cuts to avoid a suitable language and speakers or to deal certain short@@ com@@ ings of speech syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to understand the working method of fil@@ tering , it is important to know how the program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ on ; distingu@@ ishes four types of texts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the output of Screen Re@@ a@@ ics has the highest priority . it will be applied to all other orders and continues to read these orders . if the output of the Screen reader is read , the requested orders will be continued .
war@@ nings have the next priority . this stage is important news as &amp; eg ; processor becomes too hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output from messages and normal text . these orders will be continued after the issue of warning .
News have the next server priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example for an application to read messages . while you are reading a long text on a website , you can also welcome the space . &amp; k@@ mouth ; not@@ if@@ ications are also news . read it .
the rest are simple text orders . each order you require from the card card orders is a text order . KS@@ ay@@ it is an example of a applications that uses text entries . text orders are intended for the issue longer texts that do not have special ur@@ gency .
all four sub@@ types are processed in queu@@ es , with the exception of the output of Screen Re@@ aders . if an application sends the output of a Screen Re@@ aders , while &amp; kt@@ ops ; just such a read , this output will be stopped and termin@@ ated .
first you need to know that filters will never be applied to the output of Screen Re@@ aders . they are applied to normal war@@ nings , messages , and text applications as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ messages .
filters edit the text and pass it on to the next filter . at present there are three types of filters .
filters are implemented as modules . in the future , there can be more types of filters .
strings replace parts of a text by other text . the resulting parts you can specify either as words or as regular expres@@ sions . &amp; t@@ ts ; - ) by text or as regular expres@@ sions ; or by text or by mail ; or by mail ; in a better understand@@ able form .
&amp; XML ; trans@@ duc@@ ers use an X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from a format into another format . in the scope of delivery , some X@@ SL@@ T files are included in the translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; in SS@@ ML .
for example , you can send orders depending on the content of the text , or depending on the content of the text , or depending on the program . if you have a female voice for example , you can read the text from K@@ DE messages to it . read more about this .
each of these filters have adjustable rules , after which it is applied to a voice @-@ over@@ s . if the filter specifies that its rules cannot be given , he will keep the text unchanged at the next filter .
if a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; send message to &amp; kt@@ on ; it is edited by all activated filters , which are set up on the side down . the order is carried out in the order from the top to bottom .
this displays the normal filter list . if a filter is not crossed , it is not activated and is not used . filters are then processed down from the top down .
click here to add a new filter . select the type of fil@@ ters , and it will be displayed further below the following setup dial@@ ogues .
if you want to set a list of words or regular expres@@ sions as a comparison sample , these patterns will be replaced in text , then the text is exchanged for the corresponding replacement text .
&quot; &quot; &quot; enter a name for your filter . you can select this name arbit@@ rar@@ ily , he must only differ from the names of the other filters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the list of words and regular expres@@ sions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column match and replaces him in accordance with the string from the column . the list is shown in the displayed sequence from above .
click here to post@@ p@@ one the selected word or regular expression in the list .
with these buttons you can load a list of words or regular expres@@ sions from a file , save the current list or delete a list of file , entries from the file to the existing list .
here is a language registered here , the filter will only be used if the speaker is one of the languages listed here . click on the button to select a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages when clicking the &amp; C@@ trl ; button .
if a value is registered here , the filter will only be applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separated by comm@@ as . example : conversation , K@@ mail
you can leave the user ID running programs with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; the &amp; D@@ Bus ; numbers must be om@@ itted if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the user ID copy @-@ 34@@ 32 is only allowed .
the character encoding filter will only be applied to the text if all conditions work with one entry in the box Di@@ ving filter . if all input fields are empty , the filter will be applied to all texts .
when compar@@ ing words , the character encoding filter uses regular expres@@ sions in the form \ \ s word \ \ . the words must be limited by divi@@ ding signs ( spaces ) on both sides .
in this hand@@ book you will find no instructions for writing regular expres@@ sions . if you have installed the &amp; # 160 ; Editor &amp; # 160 ; editor &amp; # 160 ; editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions can be found in the package .
&amp; XML ; trans@@ duc@@ er translate &amp; XML ; using X@@ SL@@ T files from a format into another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3C standard for such um@@ form@@ ations . but it can only be applied to well @-@ shaped XML . it can be installed on your system .
give the path to the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is accessible through the environment variable PAT@@ H , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is enough .
with the spokesperson on speaker , you can send lyrics to a certain speaker , or on a speaker with certain properties . for example , you can define that texts by K@@ mail should be read from a female voice . see .
before &amp; kt@@ on ; there is a text on the filter that gives you a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected on the basis of the speaker , which the program is selected , and the attributes of the speaker is selected on the card box . with the spokesperson on the card , you can over@@ write the selected actors .
if the text is registered here , the filter will be applied in case the text is applied . it is installed on your system of &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; Brow@@ se # 160 ; regular expres@@ sions , you can call it by clicking on the button to get help when entering the input .
in order to achieve a faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , begin the regular expression of &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
click here the features of the required speaker . if the text is selected the above filter conditions , the speaker is selected , which meets the desired requirements on e@@ he@@ sten . click on the right to show the dialogue speaker selection .
use these buttons to save or load your word settings or delete all the settings .
please apply only to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ ving Filter if there must be at least one condition .
the voice @-@ over@@ s API , by &amp; k@@ de ; , with the programmer can add their applications T@@ TS capabilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; D@@ Bus ; .

none of the mentioned language syn@@ thesizer supports my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
I have set up the &amp; HTML ; XML ; re @-@ format filter , but when using the module for the festival pages , web pages are not read .
due to a mistake in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta you need to install the ( male British ) voice of Rab _ di@@ phone to do it even if you don &apos;t have to use this voice for reading websites . make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and can be found on the environment variable PAT@@ H .
certain characters or pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks seem to cause error to syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , so that whole sentences are ski@@ pped or only Kau@@ b with@@ stands . what can I do ?
first , make sure that the character encoding is set to the correct value . if there are problems with certain characters or words , they may be fixed by a string filter .

KT@@ TS works with any language syn@@ thesizer , which can be launched at the command line in one &amp; console ;
the list of the above languages can be incomplete or dated . therefore , see the description of the syn@@ thesizer to the supported languages . take a look at the web page ; according to information that are not included in this manual .
the program &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; uses a adap@@ table module architecture for voice syn@@ thesizer . if you want to expand &amp; go ; for using another syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , please contact the developer team .
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for XML ; but not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c using the apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
to comp@@ ile and comp@@ ile , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or later ) including the k@@ deli@@ bs and the development files for the program &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot;
if you do not refer to the source texts of &amp; kt@@ it , from the source repository for k@@ de@@ acc@@ essibility or downloaded at present Tar@@ ball every night , and install the program with the following commands :
before using &amp; go ; use first if speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher works properly with your language syn@@ thesizer . to do this , you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ t ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ on ; the program t@@ ms@@ gr is to be developed so further that the creation of speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher is not possible , and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer required .
a long text is de@@ composed into single sentences . the user can leave sat@@ z@@ - or ab@@ sat@@ in , repeat the output or break off .
if you have an application text on &amp; kt@@ t ; if you have set up the properties of the preferred speaker for the output . if you want to set up one female English speakers , this is used , otherwise you will find the best appropriate speaker . if you want to know more about how &amp; kt@@ ops ; you will see a speaker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when you click on the map tab , you can add a speaker on the list or click Edit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Edit speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as an example , the tab of the module for Festival Interactive . details on the modules can be found below . &quot; &quot; &quot;
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . when the path to the festival in PAT@@ H , you must only enter the festival .
select the text encoding for text that is transferred to the festival . in general , this setting is automatically made . in general , Western languages are used to use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak , and ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these slides , you adjust volume , speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you can &apos;t select some kno@@ b and be displayed in grey , the voice chosen by you will not be chosen .
some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices need to be loaded due to their size several seconds . when you mark this check box , these voices will already be loaded when starting from K@@ TT@@ SD , so that ( with larger memory consumption ) the first set will be syn@@ thes@@ ized faster .
if this check box cannot be selected , you don &apos;t have a speaker ( or do not forget to click on users ) . see .
if this check box is marked when starting at kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr the program window t@@ sm@@ gr . otherwise , the program window is visible in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window .
if this check box is marked and t@@ sm@@ gr does not run , it appears in the system section as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD is reading a text . thus , you have the possibility to stop reading or control otherwise .
here all orders are listed in the queu@@ e , together with the application that has set the order , the current status of the contract , the number of sets and the just worked sentence . the speaker ID corresponds to the ID on the card tab .
with buttons in this series , you can take a look at the order that is selected in the list below , or back . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) .
with a click on OK , all changes of the settings ( even on the other card maps ) and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr will be reduced to the icon in the system section . then click on this icon to show the program window again .
if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click the audio map audio . see also .
here only text orders are performed and managed . issues of Screen Re@@ aders , War@@ nings and News are not displayed . more information about the news types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; find in .
select the type of audio output here . if a component can not be selected , &amp; kt@@ t ; either compiled with no support for the corresponding audio module or disk ; can &apos;t load the necessary libraries .
if G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de is used for the audio output , select the audio output . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you must select at least one module . if you select AL@@ SA , select the PCM device here .
set the talk speed here . 50@@ n@@ bsp ; % corresponds to around half and 200@@ n@@ bsp ; % of the double standard speed . with that these settings can be implemented , the program SO@@ X must be installed .
click Apply to handle the new settings for the current &amp; current ; -@@ System .
the list of AL@@ SA units includes all PCM devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you &apos;ll need to figure out what device works with you . in doubt , select Standard .
on this map , you can set up special actions that will always be done if the text message is interrupted by a higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ops ; processes four types of language orders :
the output of Screen Re@@ a@@ ics has the highest priority . it will be submitted to all other entries and resc@@ ues these orders . after the output of the Screen Reader has been read , the requested orders are resumed .
war@@ nings have priority on the next priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor becomes too hot . a warning keeps the output from messages and normal text . these orders will be continued after reading the warning again .
News have the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example for an application to read messages . if you read &amp; eg ; just a long text on a website can be read by &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless someone welcome the space .
if a text message is interrupted by a message , warning or issue of a screen reader , adds &amp; kt@@ t ; the audio output in the queu@@ e .
this audio file will always be played if a normal text order is interrupted . if both sound and introduc@@ tory message is active , the introduc@@ tory sound will be played before the introduc@@ tory message .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the settings on this tab card only apply to normal text applications . there are no special actions for messages , war@@ nings , and issues of screen re@@ a@@ ics if they are interrupted by a higher priority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to read &amp; go ; read k@@ not@@ ion messages , start t@@ sm@@ gr and click on not@@ if@@ ications . the map will be published .
mark this check box to switch on &amp; k@@ ite _ not@@ if@@ ications . if this setting is not checked , the remaining settings are disabled and &amp; t@@ ts ; does not read not@@ if@@ ications .
if this setting is selected , not@@ if@@ ications , with which a sound is played , is not read .
use these buttons to add events to the list or delete it . when you click on the button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message , sent &amp; conversation ; if someone men@@ tions your nickname in an IR@@ C message .
all events , which are stated in the list , are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts ; ignored .
use this sel@@ ector to specify what &amp; kt@@ on should do if an event takes place . you have the following choices :
if you select custom text , enter the desired text . you can use the following plac@@ eholder :
you can enter the properties of the desired speech here . standard elec@@ ts the speaker , which is displayed in the list on the card box as top entry . see also .
note that there are three levels for events . if any particular event is defined for events , this is executed . otherwise , the action is executed for all other events of the specific application . otherwise , the action is scheduled for carrying out under standard ( all other events ) .
the event All Not@@ ification for Application Standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this reason , you can specify the read not@@ if@@ ications as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; use the button &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Save the button &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to store the settings for the not@@ if@@ ications from a file . if you want to start stored settings in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delete all entries &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Speech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3C standard to mark text for voice output . furthermore , brands for controlling the voice and pitch . besides , marks are part of the vo@@ ice@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3C standard .
currently supports &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following limitations are available :
you need to install the Rab _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) as this is the standard voice , which uses the festival in the output of SS@@ ML .
if the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog is not limited to 100@@ n@@ bsp ; % , SS@@ ML text is usually very mon@@ ot@@ on .
&lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#93; &lt; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UTF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &lt; !

there are two types of filters - normal filters and pro@@ mo @-@ limit@@ ing filters ( SD@@ B filter ) . this allows you to start reading or retri@@ eve only the first set . thus , you can also jump or retri@@ eve and cancel the map orders , even if the language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers do not support them directly .
here you see the sat@@ z@@ limit@@ ing filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ i ; it is automatically set up as a proposition . you can change its settings or add further sat@@ z@@ limit@@ er filters , but beginners will not be recommended .
in the easiest way , you will learn how to set up the speaker selection and select text for reading . choose some properties and check out how the speaker &apos;s choice is changed . for sure you have to set up some properties and check , if you have set up more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; go ; then faster with the reading can start , as only the first set should be processed , and not all the text block , which can last very long ,
you can then stop or cancel text entries on the card card , even if the language syn@@ thesizer does not support this function .
for these reasons , the normal typ@@ ing filter is automatically set up when you start t@@ sm@@ gr the first time . it cannot be disabled , just removed . do not change anything at this filter unless you know what you are doing .
Sat@@ .1 limit@@ ing filter compare text with a regular expression of typ@@ ing and add a tab@@ ular sign ( dec@@ imal code 8 ) to the pro@@ positi@@ onal limits ( dec@@ imal code 8 ) to the set limits ( before the fil@@ tering is automatically removed from the text ) . note that the standard pro@@ positi@@ onal filter keeps the character set .
S@@ BD @-@ filters will never be applied to &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( k@@ p ) , war@@ nings , messages , or the output of screen re@@ actors .
if you have removed the normal Sat@@ z@@ limit@@ ing filter , you can re@@ insert it again by load the standard _ sb@@ dr@@ c included file .
on the map tab , you can write the spokesperson for the application . the card card will be displayed when
use of the standard speaker ( the top on the card box ) . in other words , no speaker characteristics are specified .

this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; , which allows managing of the network interfaces , rout@@ ines and the DNS settings .
the &amp; C@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a set of system and desktop settings via a uniform , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be accessed by selecting K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package was developed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create a simple surface for the following tasks :
after installation , a new module network settings in &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; displays network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be launched by selecting the contro@@ l@@ center ; internet &amp; network network settings in &amp; k@@ menu .
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware doesn &apos;t install . physical devices and their drivers have to be operational and configured to enable &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device features and setting the network properties .
in most cases , drivers for the network hardware and other devices are added while installing and set up Linux ; network devices are added later , the driver must be loaded by adjusting the following files , corresponding to the kernel version :
&quot; &quot; &quot; the module network settings will be loaded when setting network settings at &amp; contro@@ l@@ center ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Options &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; index , this is trying to detect the used platform on the system automatically . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if the platform cannot be recognized , the manual selection is offered . it is the platform from the list to select the distribution and rele@@ as@@ est@@ and . by checking the setting no @-@ again the setting can be hit @-@ permanently . on the next start of the network settings this option is automatically pre@@ set .
changing the network settings are possible only in system management mode . before , all options are displayed gray , which means changing settings can only be considered , changing the settings mode at the bottom bottom of the module . it is required to enter the password .
in the system management mode , the module &apos;s entire functionality is available . it is divided into three riders :
the tab network interface serves to manage network appliances . all available network appliances will be displayed . from the tab network interfaces , the following tasks can be performed :
set the settings shown by selecting the desired device in the list and click the button to set up ... in the dialog device .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the button to indicate the dialog with further possibilities .
with the selection Autom@@ atically , the TCP / IP settings are made by a DH@@ CP server , or BO@@ O@@ TP Server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP settings are done at any system start , therefore no further option is required . in the sel@@ ective list , you can either choose DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in the sel@@ ective list , you can either choose DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP , according to the system .
you can specify the TCP / IP address without DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . in the IP address , the TCP / IP address must specify the required TCP / IP address .
if this setting is checked , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface when bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be enabled .
the values given in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device .
it should be ensured that the IP address is not already used in the network . with ping in the IP address , you can see whether the address is already in use . in doubt , the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or switched off if required . switching on the network device is activated by selecting from the list and click interface ...
network devices can be activated or switched off depending on your needs . setting off an activated network device is activated by selecting from the list and clicking interface ...
sets the IP address of the computer in the local sub@@ net , which provides the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ networks .
if the computer is more than a network interface , the interface must be connected to the network where the gateway computer is located .
a machine with DNS support is replaced by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers only demands IP addresses . if the calcul@@ ator htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS dis@@ sol@@ ves this name into an IP address , such as approx . 12@@ 3,@@ 5@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the calcul@@ ator on the name resolution is a simple administration of this list . entries can be added , removed or modified .@@ DNS entries can be removed by selecting an application and up or down@@ gra@@ ding in the list with buttons and below in the priority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when pressing the button you add ... from the machine calcul@@ ator to name resolution you can add a DNS server . it will be added to the New Nam@@ es@@ er@@ ver dialogue .
first you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the button to add . the entry will be inserted in the list .
from the computer machine to the name resolution , select an entry and then click on the button Edit .... It will be shown in the dialog .
the list of well @-@ known computers describes the host@@ name @-@ to @-@ IP address references for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily when bo@@ oting , if no DNS server is available . in small , closed networks it can replace DNS servers .
normally , the list of well @-@ known computers contains some entries to support &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IPv6 addresses . this is still in the test to replace IP 4 in the future version 4 .
enter the IP address of the well @-@ known computer and click Add .... The New alias will be added as well .
enter the name of the well @-@ known computer and click the Add button . if the known computer has multiple alias name , de button add several times and enter the other alias name .
select an entry of a well @-@ known computer from the list and select Edit .... The dialog &apos;s dialog is displayed .
it can be done one of the following tasks , then with clicking OK , the list of static hosts will be updated .
the settings made in the network settings are not effective immediately . in order to activate the changes , the following command must be set in a &amp; con@@ sole ; the following command must be set .
the homepage from &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; htt@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , from which you can download the latest version of the source text .
for installing the binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) , it is enough if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the finished version is recommended for less experienced users . it &apos;s easy to download the rpm package and install in a &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
alternatively , a tool can be used with a graphic interface like k@@ package or the installation tool of your distribution .
for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; not , but additionally the development packages are needed with libraries and other things .
this is only recommended users . however , it is not difficult to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the following commands should afford this .
in the first section of this chapter , important information on basic network technology will be given , in the second one will be discussed by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; changed configuration files .
this section can not replace more information about IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x , only basic information about the integration of the PC is convey@@ ed into a small ( home ) network .
IP networks are currently being operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never found great dis@@ semin@@ ation . therefore , it is expected to focus on the widespread IP@@ v4 in the near future .
one of the most important information is the knowledge of the IP address of a network interface . in external networks , at &amp; eg ; Work@@ place is the network administrator to address a valid IP address , if available , the IP address cannot be chosen arbit@@ rar@@ ily !
when applying an own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be chosen from a specially designed area to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not for@@ warded to the Internet , therefore its use is possible .
of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting up a g@@ ate@@ ways .
for smaller networks , addresses are usually used in the range of 192.168.@@ 1.1 through 192.168.@@ 1.@@ 254 . the area is big enough for networks up to 250 computers .
in addition , the net mask is set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all hosts are in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ 3 ; .0.0 and 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = of your machine ) . the default route is needed for IP transfer .
the 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 power address is reserved for IP traffic in the local own machine . normally the address 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 is assigned to a very called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circle .
in this part , the configuration files are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf , where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes modified with DSL connections , so it will not be surprised if there is no other content in the case of active DSL connections .
for &amp; SuSE ; it is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in Su@@ S@@ Econ@@ fig . another stand as expected can therefore occur .

&amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for tape drives based on tar . it offers the opportunity to save multiple archives on a tape . the first goal was to create multiple archives in a band . the second goal was to answer a question that my wife stated : how much longer does it take ?
before a band can be used , it must be embedded by &amp; k@@ dat ; it can be done in three ways :
&amp; k@@ dat ; spin the tape back and reads the pre@@ st@@ ressing information of the tape . recognize &amp; k@@ dat ; if the tape does not know , you will be asked if the band is form@@ at@@ ted .
det@@ ects &amp; k@@ dat ; it searches for the matching index on your record . if it cannot be found , you will be asked if the band index is to be re@@ constructed .
everything went smoothly , the symbol for the tape drive , to indicate that the band has been merged . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the contents of the tape can now be searched by fl@@ aps of the entry for the band .
before laying down the tape , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this :
&amp; k@@ dat ; can be seen by changing the symbol for the band that the binding for the tape has been solved and displays the status bar a corresponding message . the tape can now be disc@@ arded without any danger .
before a band of &amp; k@@ dat ; it can be used , it must be form@@ at@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat ; form@@ at@@ ted .
a band@@ aging need to form@@ at@@ ted before you can use form@@ atting at &amp; k@@ dat . if you need to form@@ at@@ ted a tape before use , you need to form@@ at@@ ted a tape before use . flo@@ ppy disk drives usually do not require form@@ atting of the tape , DA@@ T drives , on the other hand .
after entering the band name and the capacity drives &amp; k@@ dat ; with the form@@ atting of the tape . all data on the tape are lost thereby ! after completion of the form@@ atting , the tape is automatically integrated and ready for use .
before you encounter the backup procedure , you need to select the securing files . this can be done in three ways :
select a file or folder in a local file tree . only this file or folder will be secured .
mark a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are secured .
mark files in the local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are secured .
with the right mouse button , click on the local file tree and select in the She@@ ep ...
once the backup was introduced , the dialog window will open for backup . in this dialog you can check the selected files and change the settings for backup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you have confirmed the settings , the dialog appears . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dialog shows the progress of the backup process including data rate and the remaining time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mark a file or folder in one of the archives in the record for the drive . only the selected file or folder will be checked .
mark the files in one of the archives in the record for the band with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
with the right mouse button , click on one of the archives and select the menu entry ...
once the test procedure has been started , the dialog appears for checking . in this dialog you can check your selection and change the job folders for review .
when you have confirmed the settings for checking , the dialog appears . this dialog shows the progress of checking and the data through@@ put and the remaining time .
before you can run the restore , the files you will need to be selected . this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives belong to the band &apos;s work . only the selected file or sub@@ folders will be restored .
select the files you want from one of the archive with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored .
right click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select a folder ....
once the restore process has been started , the dialog for Rest@@ oring . in this dialog you can check your selection and change the working folder for recovery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you have confirmed the settings for recovery , the dialog appears . this dialog shows the progress of recovery and the data through@@ put and the remaining time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sometimes it proves to be necessary to re@@ generate the band@@ inde@@ x@@ file based on the band content . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this band . you can re@@ generate the index on two ways of the band :
this is a f@@ use profile with the selected files and default settings . you can make the following settings for a backup profile :
the current working folder where the backup is to be made . the list of files to be secured is automatically updated accordingly .
for all folders which are listed under backup files , the files are stored on the same file system , such as the folder . folder , which are located on other file systems , you may register separately under backup files . every entry is detected by tar independently from the other .
perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snap@@ shot is used . only the files have changed since then .
the name of the file , which is used to make changes since the last incre@@ mental backup is used .
delete the snap@@ shot file before calling tar . this causes all files to be secured and a new snap@@ shot file for the next backup is created .
the buttons of buttons files &amp; gt ; lt ; and lt ; files were not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
you can set up the Settings menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the full path to the device file for the tape drive ( normally / dev / Tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ process variant of the band device .
if this setting is active , transmitted &amp; k@@ dat ; before the tape is integrated into the drive . at some drives , this is necessary before reading or write operations can be performed .
if the option is enabled , &amp; k@@ dat is trying to block the outlet for the band run . maybe this setting does not work with all tape drives .
if the option is enabled , the release is kicked off by &amp; k@@ dat ; automatically rele@@ asing the tape . do not use this option for flo@@ ppy drive .
if the option is switched on , &amp; k@@ dat ; not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter whether this setting is active or not , you need &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case you need to inform the block size for your band@@ ry .
if &amp; k@@ dat ; a tape is form@@ at@@ ted , it writes a file to the start of the band . this file should only comp@@ ile a memory block on the tape . the content of the file is composed as follows :
( n Byte ) The band ID . the format of this string is the name name : seconds , where the name is the complete name of the system , on which the tape has been form@@ at@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds passed since the time when the tape has been form@@ at@@ ted .
the band ID is used to find a file using the same name in the $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat file .
the remaining files on the tape are pure tar archive which can be done directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work as long as it is not about incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the contents of a backup . this symbol is only active when a tape is integrated .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; viewer for system logs . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users , where you can get information about your system or where the system allows you to get information about your system . in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users can use quick access to information on problems that appear on their server .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users to understand what your computer is in the background . the task is suitable for un@@ familiar users who cannot know where you can get information about your system or where the system stored the different protocol files .
moreover , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users can perform quick access for example on information about problems that can appear on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; therefore tries to provide some advanced features which can be filtered and evaluated by certain programs .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . these include :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
as you can see in the following screen photo , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions are available , with their help the individual protocol lines of a protocol file easily fil@@ tering and sort out . the individual ways to sorting and filters are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after the start &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first the most important protocol @-@ file of the system - to open , and it opens instead of its a small message window , so you &apos;ll find it instead of system administ@@ rators . the protocol files usually doesn &apos;t have access to read in the folder / var / log , for which normal users do not have access to read .
you can also use the filter bar to filter out according to a selected crit@@ eri@@ on or according to the filter box . in the default setting , set a log file next to the selected filter . then , a log line will display only if in one of the columns contain the character string of the filter search .
you can also select another entry at this point . in addition , select the string searches in the selected column , and then select the name of a process in the log bar . then , select &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all log lines , which were sent or created by this process .
this option is enabled in default settings and helps you detect the important protocol @-@ lines . protocol lines of level errors are displayed using a show@@ y color as protocol @-@ lines of the stage . the colour display of protocol @-@ rows can be disabled .
if you want to view a certain process ( for example , in the system protocol or cr@@ on protocol ) , then you can examine the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in column process , for example , if you want to examine the output of a certain command as for example to start the sam@@ ba server . in this case you use filter bar .
in addition , you can activate the option on new lines in context menu of the main window to display all new added protocol @-@ lines .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows the display of several protocol files in separate sub @-@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open up and manage . once you select a sub@@ window , select a protocol on display .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has a website based on htt@@ p : / / system@@ log@@ .@@ forum software @-@ soft@@ war@@ e.@@ or@@ g D@@ ort you will find more recent information about the sources of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; you can also find in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; Subversion Archives : k@@ system@@ log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; archive
welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and in the following as named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section guides some concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ;
the System V In@@ it rapidly develops into the standard for controlling the system starts at the up@@ swing of the system in the &amp; Linux ; and therefore , because it &apos;s easier to use , more powerful and more flexible than the traditional BSD -@@ In@@ it system .
I will not go on historical aspects here ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it : - ) .
the In@@ it binary is below / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is why perhaps someone could try to switch a machine to System V in@@ it , without a re @-@ installation and re @-@ format . so you need to make sure that the old In@@ it was removed from there if there was one .
the SY@@ S@@ V In@@ it also differs from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files in a sub@@ folder of / etc are instead of directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and following other folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d includes a whole bunch of scripts . basically you need a script for each system service you want to run on the up@@ swing of the system or when switching to another run@@ level . system services do not include such things like set@@ serial , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , htt@@ pd &amp; etc ; system services do not include such things as set@@ serial , which only once started . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should be under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even if you do not have much use of this . you can also create a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something with the serial port .
the kernel is looking for different places following the in@@ it program and starts the first one to find .
the default run@@ level is in / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab . you should see a line like the following :
at this point you can take a look at the second column , and probably tell you that the default run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change this , then you can fix / etc / in@@ quire , then you come to repair it by restart the system and execute the following :
but how does it take all the right scripts ? if you enter -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you probably see something like the following :
you will notice that in this folder doesn &apos;t find any right files . instead , each entry is a link to one of the scripts in directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d .
how does it start and stops in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is written such a argument as start and stop . you can actually start this scripts out of hand on the command line as follows :
this would hold the htt@@ pd server . in@@ it reads the name , and if the one contains , the script will be called by stop . if it includes a S , the script will be called using the argument .
some people wish to set up a simple way of creating machines for many purposes . I could run &amp; eg ; a server lap , which can only run htt@@ pd , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , Network &amp; etc ; , moreover , I could also have a user lap , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , Network &amp; etc ; .
here you learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; using a mouse or another poin@@ ter is simple to say tri@@ vial : simply drag a record from the field of avail@@ ables to one of the six run@@ level to start it on this level ( or stop ) .
you can also move scripts between run@@ lev@@ elling , or change the position within a level by taking it somewhere else . this will not happen if they move from its original run@@ level ( or its position ) . this happens only if they draw an entry from the field of availability .
note : entries will be post@@ pon@@ ed if you select them to a new section . in order to copy them to a new run@@ level , you must explicitly select copying from the menu Edit or from the context menu , and then if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action .
the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you need to edit the sorting inputs before attemp@@ ting to insert the system service .
note : there is no way to restore entries , which were cast into the tr@@ ash bin . be careful .
you can use the tab button to activate the different work areas ( available system services , run@@ level 1 start , run@@ level 1 stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to make a selection upper or below the previous .
to move an entry into another run@@ level , move it with cutting into the clip@@ board ( you can also use C@@ trl ; X ) and add it to the desired run@@ level with inser@@ tion ( with C@@ trl ; V ) .
to change the sorting number or the name of a single entry , press the input button to change the Properties dialog . close the dialog by typ@@ ing the input button to accept changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes .
because of the risk of loss of data , all entries in the menu requires a confirmation before being executed .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . pre@@ ferences will be taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise , they will be saved by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; res@@ umes . changes to default are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I have experim@@ ented with the standard lap@@ tops , and now the machine re@@ starts to re@@ tire . what can I do ?
enter the L@@ ILO @-@ Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in the user @-@ user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ quire and change the default run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should be normally fine ) .
I have provided some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for execution under run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you are using &amp; SuSE ; or Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) then you need to edit additional files in / etc , which are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of the distribution .
the way , how system services are started in these distri@@ butions , but does not simpli@@ fy the proprietary setup programs of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately no standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you are using a different distribution , please check if all configuration files are needed ( and also whether they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache or htt@@ pd ) are easy to termin@@ ate when their configuration files are not available or wrong .
the importance of &amp; Linux ; the run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you use a different distribution , please send me information on the run@@ level to allow these to be added to this manual .
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; k@@ user ; it &apos;s sufficient to read the chapter custom@@ ization of &amp; k@@ user ;
after making any changes you have to save , you must save them . either you use the corresponding symbol of tool@@ bar or the Save In menu .
&amp; k@@ user ; is an easy application . the main window consists of two card cards , user and user @-@ tro@@ users . to do , select the desired user or the desired group with a double click on the record . it appears the dialog user and group properties .
some flash@@ cards will only be displayed when you have advanced system settings . only if you can make advanced system settings , if you can make individual adjustments , if shadow passwords , or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed in BSD slices .
the card password will appear if shadow passwords , or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed in BSD slices .
this card card only appears if for at least one @-@ bound file system ( Qu@@ ota ) is activated and initi@@ alized ( identi@@ fi@@ able at the file quot@@ as user / quot@@ as group on the file system ) . here , the limitation limits can be changed for each user parameters :
these parameters can be set separately for each file system . the current file system is selected with the help of the field file system .
the boxes are informed about the group sub@@ missions of the selected user . the standard group , to which the user is owned , can be found in the Pri@@ m@@ sen group . furthermore , the user can become a member in other groups by marking them in the large field .
the Group &apos;s dialog features a list of users . to add a user to the group , mark this user in the list .
to add a user or a group , choose from the user menu or group or click the matching Add button of the tool bar . editing or delete the selected user or the selected group works analog .
with this module you can install the L@@ ILO Boat Manager , remove , remove and change the time to the bo@@ oting of the standard operating system to remove , remove , modify , modify , modify , and more .
