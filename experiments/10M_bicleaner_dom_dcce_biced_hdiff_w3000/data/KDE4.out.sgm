<seg id="151">Maybe you will be happy with this structure. you can easily organize articles about your location. if you've been here several times the same place. if you have enough photos, then you will use subfolders such as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc; you can then print a folder for pictures you print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have different requirements, such as versioning photos, archiving, work processes, constant supply of images on different topics and a large number of all. within 10 years 95% archives and 5% working files will be and you will not want to reorganise your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What kinds of files fit together? separation of file types makes the pile processing easier. separate new from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and working files simplifies a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derived image.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend the metadata into the file's settings page. if you forget that EXIF and IPTC data will be written into the file. if you forget, then you can save the metadata from the database in the files by choosing the corresponding item in the menu album.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change what if you want to change? add a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are the most important ones.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work starts, as you should now select any photograph words, labs and an evaluation. of course, you can select all images that will need the same attribute. you start the best with the evaluation or the ranking. this makes sense when you can focus on the best photos.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let's go with keywords, keywords, as you often are called in other programs. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">When you import Catalogging pictures from another source with embedded windows, then & digicame; automatically set the tree for you to build the pictures on another. the changed keywords are done on one another. the changed keywords are taken by & digious; updated during it the undertrees.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphic shows how different metadata changes. this is a very coarse representation because every block of metadata is composed of many sections. filenames and calendar data are properties of all pictures.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keywords - the next section refers to labelling or comments, the third important tool for cataloging your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">Most people don't want to just see your photos just, you want to share them with your friends, your family, other photographers and agencies. they are safe to take care of your photos.</seg>
<seg id="163">Have a look at this panoramic view. from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama. if you look closer to see some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I say to you this the landeplatz of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachot; in the French Normans 60 years after the landing. Wow! one starts to dream, associations, the historical time span is again present, you may even hear the silence. thus, your perception has completely changed this panoramic view.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others viewing your photos it may be more important than the image itself to create an interest. if you show pictures you should tell a story. remember, the key is to help you understand the key to help you understand what you need to understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to act with inscribing alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digious; you can use any other text in an internationalised alphabet. you can even export it to a selection of pictures at the same time. if you export your pictures in Web-galleries, then these labels will be able to tell your imaginations in the label and / or the title of the web site.</seg>
<seg id="168">Do you remember the times before GPS? when you had to find in another city without navigation system? was the earth not a boring planet from GoogleEarth? well, because with pictures the train leaves the spatial presentation now with light speed.</seg>
<seg id="169">The opportunities to exploit geolocalization are already countless. I'm sure that one day, in the near future, can be able to repeat your journeys by images with geographic information. you can also export the photos on the capture site. you can also export the photos on the capture site. you can also export the images to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a word game with copyright and denoting the practice the copyrights to remove restrictions on distribution and change of copies. the same freedoms also apply in all versions, so also for the work of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you what information is in the setup page of & digious; as information should be deposited as information:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for creator and author): this field should contain your name, or the name of the photographer, for example, to protect the identity of the photographer, then the name of a company or organization is used. after which this value was saved, it should not be changed. this field does not support composites or semicolons as separator.</seg>
<seg id="173">Autism: linked to the author. this field contains the job title of the photographer. examples of this title can be titles as: employee photographer, freelance photographer, or independent commercial photographer. as this is a note to the author field, this must be completed as well.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publisher (synonym for providers): use the vendor field to identify those who offer this photo. if the photographer works for a news agency such as Reuters, or Associated Press, then these organizations can be listed here. if the picture is a storage picture, the group / agency is given the picture here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections, although they have no protection against abuse. every one has a little more than basic knowledge in working with calculator. for individuals, this is important for the majority of your photos only from low interest. for professionals and hale professionals, this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique in each image. & digicame; in the near future, a module for staple processing is available.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: turnouts, turnout, electricity, ECC, transmission errors, aging of storage media, recovery, redundancy, desks, life-time, temperature, data size, spread superstition</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course we don't talk about CDs that were lost on the street or a fire. these kinds of losses are the same which can also happen to you with traditional paper photos or negatives. in this section it's about problems with the so-called New Media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll Ontrack, the largest data recovery firm in the world, has some interesting statistics which reasons for a data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">To fight the problem with CDs / DVDs this must be treated more difficult and you may not buy more than a few years. of course, you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archiving quality. of course there are offers about gold-coated DVDs, & dollar; 2 this piece can claim a lifetime of 100 years for themselves. if you believe it is in your messy room.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD Disks can be illegible, but you can use this risk in which you can use good Disks and good recording devices. the best DVD recordings are not much more expensive than the cheapest, but you write much reliable. it's about to select the right way.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very susceptible to mistakes, even if you just have just written. 75% of the data are only effective data, the rest we need for the formatting and the control environment. despite this massive protections they are needed by chemical aging, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc;</seg>
<seg id="183">For faulty CDs and DVDs, there's a convenient program called IsoBuster, but it doesn't work for Macs, but it's not available for Macs. there are also similar applications to read the damaged data of damaged disks, hard drives, flash media, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray discs seem to store the format war against the HD DVD. a dual-layer Blu-ray disc can save 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual-layer DVD with 8.5 GB. all that was said to CDs and DVDs is also valid for the Blu-ray disc.</seg>
<seg id="185">Burn slowly with a good recording device on high quality media in a non-propriated format. you should also read the media on a clean, dark dry and protected animals protected site. you don't forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the latest piece of hardware or software that can read these media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Disk manufacturers keep your statistics for themselves. your manufacturer's tools include a new disk, but not the data. Google introduces a large field study on the error-mechanisms of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="187">Shortly, Disks keep the most frequent error rate when you are operating at the temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. in case of lower temperature cases, this error may not determine the immediate failure. these are particularly readers and reiteration. these are particularly readers and reiteration. the expected lifetime of life is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the complete loss due to overvoltage. of course, you can also have data loss due to an blackout before you have secured the files, but these losses are normally restored without major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electric devices do not make up a lot, this can take heavy damage to devices with computer chips and high-speed hardware. these may cause serious damage, hardware age, destroyed motherboards and other defects. thus, protect yourself from the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most common protection against power peaks is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that is absorbed and the rest is earthed. it is normally available in the form of a plug bar. remember that not every plug-bar also contains a surge protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for an overvoltage protection, then you should be sure that he fulfils the UL 1449 standard. you should also take care of protection against lightning strikes and protects the correctly connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since an overvoltage of each cable can be used to your computer, you should also take care of all peripherals that can be connected to your system. some manufacturers make a phone connection for your modem. others offer connection possibilities for the coaxial cable of the cable modems and the TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, then you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are specially developed for notebooks, and therefore contain the protection for the modem. thus, you are ideal for travelling.</seg>
<seg id="194">While an overvoltage protection your system protects against smaller variations in power supplies, it will not really help you with a complete failure. even a failure of few seconds can result in loss of irreplaceable data. therefore, it may be useful to invest in a interruptible power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to protection from overhings, these devices can automatically add battery energy. this gives you the possibility to save your data and work on. if you buy a UPS, you should be sure to keep the same quality requirements like an overvoltage protection. furthermore, the lifetime of the battery and the supplied software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Remember the potential risk of being exposed to your computing system and increase your safety in terms of energy costs with the costs to avoid this. a high-quality overload protection can be paid for less than & euro; 40. this is only a small price difference if you are considering how well your computer is protected. at the end, you should always call all cables before you go to holiday.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the correct configuration you can use this as a drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to save it as a backup destination for your software. Google Shared Storage is another popular offer that you can store any quantity of data.</seg>
<seg id="198">But compared to the hard drives at home, however, very expensive - 40 GB cost & dollar; 75 per year and 400 GB cost & dollar; 500. in addition, you must send the data on comparatively slow internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">Solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images. this is not a bad solution, but there is no general backup solution. it is too slow.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo community 23hq.com provide online storage services that are available on photos. you will not have your pictures available, in case of Flickr dramatically more. for $25 per year you will get unlimited memory which should only be checked in reality.</seg>
<seg id="201">The data backup is very secure from the point of view of data backup. transfer errors are automatically adjusted to the TCP protocol, and in the big companies offer a backup and a stored memory. thus, they are safe.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the calculator. all transfers are susceptible to transmission errors. the filesystem support and btrfs establish at least the data integrity between operating system and hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing is that there is no one to tell you when a transmission error occurred. all these disturbances remain undiscovered until you stay in your computer. no one seems to have thought about it. no one seems to have thought about it. the Internet with its TCP protocols is a much safer data path than that in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses, as they generate interferences within data currents. these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are not affected by transmission problems, you should look into the future. in 2010, you will see thousands of errors per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">"" "ZFS from Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates who are able to deal with record lack and highly scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under one of the GPL licensed license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it is available soon for & Linux; and Windows is available." ""</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle started an initiative with his btrfs filesystem. this is still in alpha state. it uses the same protections of the zfs and is also available for & Linux; but it is not part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of the data loss in the notebook and 46% of the workplace systems. in case of notebooks, the proportion of theft is already 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss because of viruses is less common than most people think. it is currently limited to Microsoft systems, such as theft or reinstallments. and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know very few viruses and under & Linux; no one has been sighted for long.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less vulnerable to data loss as proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS and XFS to call the common filesystems. you can find a very good English article here.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss: wrong, only the speed of trial during a sudden interruption during surgery is higher and an undefined status is avoided. however, if a file was not completely saved before the problem occurred, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the biggest threat to digital data: wrong, theft and human faults are the major causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Digital cameras sensors are 1-2 aperture settings removed from fundamental physical limits. it is meant that while technology continues to develop a natural limit for this progress. sensitivity and space characteristic for all types of light sensors are no longer removed from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras go towards the 10 megapixels. even though this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the final result is more deteriorating for compact cameras. even DSLR cameras have a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">A 750GB hard drive you get responsible today for 100 & euro; so you don't think any other data loss for data loss. so your data is often affected by a data loss. so check your data often according to a plan and try to make sure you feel any more dangerous like the new installation of your operating system, the exchange of disks or the size change of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you take your securities on an external SATA drive. if, then one day, you hit a flash when the drive was not connected in the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster strikes locally and destroys a lot. forget airplane gap: fire, water, electricity, children and theft are dangerous enough for your data. they usually concern a whole room or the whole house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore desks always means a non-local storage. bring your fuses up the stairs up to the neighboring house, in your office or something like.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of the physical separation: as above already is a common reason for a data loss despite fuse the panic. if you have a backup that is not available immediately, then you can save that one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Full backup: a full backup of all files that should be secured. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy of a date.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differentiation: a backup of files that have been modified since the last complete backup. creates a complete snapshot of two time points: the complete backup and the last differential.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of files that have been changed since the last backup. you can restore the original status at any time to which one backup is made. this fuse comes with a versioning system next to the exception that it is only degeted and not continuous.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines. in contrast to script controlled FTP, or other kinds of file transfer scripts, rsync only the difference of files that have really changed. this happens and if you want to enhance safety about ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Backup important pictures directly after you saved them on your computer to a DVD or another optical media.</seg>
<seg id="225">This approach makes you enough time to detect and restore loss. at the same time, you come to secure, but with & lt; 130% of the size of the working files. at the end, you have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot of each month. every further dilution should be done manually, after which you have made a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata, stored in the image file used IPTC data, retain memory, scalability, media, relocate of images and metadata, copy the images to the next generation of media, applications, OSes, virtualization, visibility,...</seg>
<seg id="227">With that valuable pictures can survive the next 40 year, that is approximately the time span in which you are really interested in your childhood or adolescence, there are two strategies that should be respected:</seg>
<seg id="228">As the future is predictable because of your nature is not predictable, you need to review and reassess anything today. unfortunately, there is no other way to ask yourself as a certain vigilance. every 5-8 years you should ask yourself how the current system is backwards. if less you have used in the past, it is easier to assess the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered using the explanations in this document. use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is now available for everyone. so if you have an old system that is important to read your images, keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for a later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the Council is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, your memory and backup technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard. stay open to open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is designed to change a system in its size. this is actually increasing.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you have entered the scalability with you and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition. at * nix systems like & Linux; you can copy this area and shift it to a new record:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check the dmesg command, if your new record has been recognized by the system, but do not hang them.</seg>
<seg id="235">& dollar; dd if = / dev / SDC # source is / dev / SDC / SDC. parted resize / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; parted resize / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; resize2fs / dev / sadc1 # change the size of ReiserFS if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open Source standards have the big advantage of an open specification. even if there is no software to read, then you can create it yourself. this task is easier for year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that disappears slowly from the market. therefore, you shouldn't use it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG has been used as an open source standard to replace the GIF. however, it is no longer necessary to store XMP, Exinf and IPTC Metadata, 16-bit per color channel and full transparency. PNG can store a lot of administrative information, but not as many as TIFF needs and has a slow compression. we would like to recommend you to store your images.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF has been widely distributed as image format. it manages images in high quality, but it manages images in high quality, but requires very large files. with some cameras you can store your pictures in this format. a problem is that this format has been adapted from many people. there are therefore more than 50 different types, and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The Digital Negative File Format is a license-free and open resource format that has been developed by Adobe Systems. it has been developed because of the need to use the camera power formats. it is already available on the TIFF / EP format and we hope to use the camera values and we hope to use the competitors Canon and Nikon also sometime.</seg>
<seg id="241">This is possibly one of the reasons why, around 2001, Adobe has introduced its XML-based XMP technology; a mixture of XML and RDF. XMP stands for & quot; Extensible Metadata Platformquot;, a mix of XML and RDF. the file information is stored by extension & quot; .xmpquot; saved the XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers pull it before an original of your recording, mostly in the raw format, to archive file formats and the image file is required. therefore, it can be linked to the link between the metadata stream and the image file. therefore, you should consider whether you use DNG as container and put it together there.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organization supporting a wide range of application purposes and business models. the activities of DCMI belongs to the DCMI communities and the DCMI working groups, annual conferences and educational efforts to achieve extensive acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import images from the camera, the card reader, or the scanner. as long as the pictures are available on the camera, you can use it as temporary fuse.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert Rohfiles to DNG and save it in your raw Archive. this function is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a fine-layer machining you can use external programs. if you have the pictures again with & digiplug; then edit the metadata back again. these were cut down under circumstances from other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the processed pictures for copyright with a digital watermark. export it only then in web galeries, encode in MPEG, use in contact page, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digious; in the addition of a photo to an album, you can find a description of how you can already have photos that you have already installed on your hard drive. but the camera interface makes you a lot of advanced settings for importing images to your Albendatenbank.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digiplug; connect them with the computer, turn the camera on the display mode and turn it on. another description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When you start the camera interface, it's trying to connect to your camera. when the connection is made, a fertile indicator appears at the lower end and the thumbnails of all photos on the camera will be displayed. some cameras do not appear. if this is the case, the file names and a symbol for file access is displayed for each file, photos, movies, music etc.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you can download the photos on your computer, you may need to see the camera information about any entry. with the lateral features and metadata from the camera interface, you can see the characteristics of an entry or its metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog shows file properties and the photo information that are stored internally by the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer. note that in some digital cameras not all information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The rider metadata shows the internal metadata like EXIF, production remark, GPS etc. of the image. this information is the same as in the Metadata sidebar from the main window of & digious; or the image editing. note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button to download and then download all the photos from your camera to a single album in & digi.. downloading the photos will not be deleted, and we will recommend you check out the pictures to be downloaded in an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you do not want to download all photos, you can only select the desired option with the standard selection methods of & k.. once you choose the photos, use the button to download and then download Selected. select the button chosen as long as you choose some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, a new option is available. these images have been downloaded from & digious. in this case, the new images are marked with a star in the preview window. if you select this option, only the new pictures will be downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">If you want to download or download the buttons below, a dialog appears where you can select the target album, in which the pictures are sorted, displayed. details on the folder you can read in the section My Albums. then select the target album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After completing the target album, press OK, and & digicame; invites the photos from the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete all of them from the camera. if you want to delete all the files, you will need to select it first and then you will need to delete it out.</seg>
<seg id="260">Please note that there is no way you want to recover from the camera. if you have been deleted from the camera, you should carefully check if the photos are successfully removed from the camera. if you want to delete it from camera, you should be able to delete it from camera platforms, as this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras use as filenames for the photos often not particularly meaningful name. the filenames are usually recomputed after taking photos from the camera to the same album. therefore, it can be useful, the date and the time when the image has been made to incorporate into the filename.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section you will find options for rotating and flip-up options. if you use this latter option, a folder will be created a folder each day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options During the transfer will open three more options which will be performed before the photos on the record will be stored. if you select, the respective entries will be copied from the EXIF information in the IPTC fields. with the latest option you can correct the date and time for all downloaded images.</seg>
<seg id="264">If you wish to do another file format as the standard format, you can use the prefix photo -% Y-% m-% d% H:% M:% S. for further adjustments you should read the help of the command strfiltime.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the camera name file name, you have the possibility to change the filenames in lowercase. or in uppercase letters, if you prefer this.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new filename, the digiplug; for a photo is used, the camera will be displayed under the name. your settings for renaming are stored and automatically used when you open the camera's next time.</seg>

<seg id="268">The automatic turn is normally turned on, and if your camera does not deliver this information, it can be turned off. if you want to turn off the automatic turn, use the button Advanced and select the automatic turn in the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera provides information on the date, at which the picture has been made, it can use. all images with the same date will be loaded into the same subalbum. not all cameras put this information available in the same subalbum. not all cameras will be able to check out what information your camera could have embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is normally powered, and in this case we stores, and in this case you need to change this option. if you want to change this option, use the button Advanced and select the option Datumsbased subtitles at the bottom end of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is the button to download. then select uploading. the file selection dialog & kde; appears where you can select the files uploaded. you can also select more than one file with the Standard & kde; methods.</seg>

<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document, thus the determination of the data can be displayed in longitude and latitude. the identification of data can be performed by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European Galileo or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographers, it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographic place. not everyone uses an airplane to capitalize an area by automatic recording of GPS data. environmenters, military, police, architecture offices and real estate agents can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you have forgotten where exactly the photo was made, you can click with a click to open the area. if you want to localize a postcard to another & digious user; users who want to localize the place of the photos so it is good to record the position data of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is how do the GPS data come in the picture? first you should know that exiv2 supports many GPS data fields, such as the direction, arches and map referencing. there are at least three ways to achieve this. directly with the right hardware, via a post-processing of GPS data and image files with the KIPI module for geographic classification (manual) and last about manual input of well-known locations.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is currently no camera that has a GPS unit integrated. but there are a few that work with GPS receivers, either as card module or transfer of data using a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>

<seg id="279">Downloading GPS data from one device can be done with gpsman or gpsbabel, but you must save those data in GPX format, as this is the only format supported by the geographic assignment.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are several programs for & Windows; and Mac OS, which can extract and correlated data from images and GPS. on the following page you can do the same under & Linux; make: gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the longitude and latitude or other data, then you can use this script using the ExifTool by Phil Harvey. it uses the signs hairy coordinates, e.g. by maps.google.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com shows no European street types. here are some European pages, at least in French, German and Spanish, which show all navigation details for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="283">& digicame; try to change so much control over its working processes as possible. in order to access these settings, you need to set up these settings; you need to set up in eight pages. you can switch between these settings by clicking on the symbols of the left side.</seg>
<seg id="284">Select action can be set on a preview or edit image processing. specify the default behavior of & digiplug; firm, when you click on one entry in the main view.</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains as shown below, the standard didacy and copyright information. this data will be automatically selected in the respective IPTC data fields, if the option is synchronized to download from the camera body.</seg>
<seg id="286">Autortitel is a synonym for authors: this field should be the job title of photographer, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer or independent, commercial photographer. since this is a detailed description on the field of authorization, this must be also filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Publisher is a synonym for suppliers: use this field to enter the photo. this does not have to be the author, as such as Reuters, or Associated Press, then these organizations should be registered here, then this picture should be shown here. if the picture is a warehouse, then the group and agency should be shown here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC-actions save the data in the respective IPTC-field. thereby, the metadata is permanently included in the picture and not only in the database of & digious; this metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported without getting lost.</seg>
<seg id="289">Image capture as embedded lettering (JFIF) in JPEG pictures: this synchronizes the comments that you may include into your photos, including pictures embedded in pictures, which are already labelled on labels, these are overwritten by the digious images.</seg>
<seg id="290">The Settings page contains all the options that appear, if the mouse pointer is displayed in the main window over a file. depending on the selected option, this information will be displayed or not.</seg>
<seg id="291">& # 160; digiplug; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats; to specify which file types & digicame; indicate, you can add the file extensions to this list and remove. each file in one & digicame; Albumfolder, which has no such expansions, is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="292">The default settings can be reset once again by pressing the button on the right of each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">The settings of the indicator of & digious; can be set on this page at the default values. however, some pictures have different sizes and synchronous mode. you should only use different sizes and synchronous mode. if you have one, then you can only receive better visibility results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, the image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer a different color, you can select it here. you can use the tool bar if you use the image processing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or bright color in the image. these colors are defined here. in the image processing, this indication mode can be switched on and off with F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">"" "Chroma subsampling is meant that the images are encoded in a higher resolution of the luminance than in the colour information. please read this article in Wikipedia about the next explanation." ""</seg>
<seg id="297">With setting PNG-compression you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not reduce the image quality, since PNG is a lossless algorithm. if you have a fast calculator, you can set this value to a high compression. this means 1: a low and 9 high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">With the TIFF-files option you can compress the deflate compression ratios for TIFF-images. this reduces the size of TIFF-images. it has no effect on image quality since the deflate algorithm works loss-free.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the hunter-free JPEG 2000 files you can freely save yourself. even if you have been writing the losshairy setting, the ratio is far better than normal JPEG. when this paragraph was written, metadata was not supported yet, but was in planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In previous versions of & digious, the image processing was only a picture viewer for photos. currently, it evolves quickly into a tool for manipulating your photos. with this dialogue you can change the settings of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The default is that all the green pixels are equal to ultraviolet light. if you use this option, this difference is slightly soft, eliminates this problem with minimal loss of details. this option is a bit soft, eliminates the 2x2 red pattern with VNG- or the AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white camera is used. otherwise, if set, the automatic colour balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used when the white is not set. standard is a fixed colour balance, which was photographed on a white map that was photographed in the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. the use of the second sensors has the effect that substrated images get more details in four steps. for other cameras this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The standard is the shlichter, so the parts of your pictures are burned, due to the inability of your camera to capture the top quality, as it shows the tailer in various Rosatönen. at last, you can try to redesign some parts of the missing information from the top performers.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels is generally not as fast as green and red. & digicame; and dcraw are therefore trying to reconstructed the missing blue and red portions thereof. of course this is a question how much color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">When you select the option, you get the option to set up a level. this is a value of three a compromise and / should therefore be customized for each image.</seg>
<seg id="308">Put the luminance value according to your taste. you probably need to put it slightly higher than the default 1. but this can also be done later in the picture options of the digiplug; to keep the time for the demo body small, you should be conservative.</seg>
<seg id="309">A demo account algorithm is a digital image process for calculating a complete picture of the partial data sensor, which provides many cameras and that contains a Matrix coloured pixel. this algorithm is also known as CFA Interpolation or Farbreeds.</seg>
<seg id="310">& digicame; and Dcraw make you three alternatives available: Bilinear, VNG interpolation and AHD interpolation (variable number of gradient) was the first algorithm created by Dcraw. however, he generates Farbartefacts on the edges. Bilinear is interesting when you are looking for a fast solution with acceptable result.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color deviation of your lentils, you can set the red and blue corrections here. this is certainly the best method for color deviation, as it is performed during the conversion process.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the color information and instructions as they should be given back. there are also LCMS and & digiadded; information such as the color information from a color space in the other means that the colors are as precisely as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Any questions, if a picture is opened in the image processing, start the color administration module with raw files.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color profile folders You can set the folder, such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .color / ICC, in which you save all your profiles. & digicame; examine these folders then during the start.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of ICC profiles you have the option & quot; standard squot; for your profile setting. everything can be changed when opening the raw file later.</seg>
<seg id="316">The color administration view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. only your pictures are not managed on the whole screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should be fit for the camera and model. not all profiles are built on the same type. there are some, such as Canon, which contain no colour toned or gammakorumcture. currently, dcraw gamma not corrected for conversion at 16 bit depth. this means that you need to perform the color image yourself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are more options like the Soft-Proof Profile, with which you can emulate, as your printer has a smaller color range when your camera has a smaller color range as your camera and some colors are therefore very satiated. you can adjust manually, instead of leaving your printer on the blind algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras, it's pretty obvious that color profile for them is intended for. unfortunately, not with the models of Canon. therefore, a table of cameras and profiles can be fit together. this answer is of course inofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile extension allows the style to recognize: F for a precise style, L for landscapes, N for neutral, P for portrait and S for standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; image plugin interface. it is an interface that is supported by a number of & kde; picks and image processing supported by providing this interface, which have been written to work with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has installed the KIPI modules, you will see a list of available modules. select the modules you want, and these modules will then appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition you will find some also in the context menu of the preview.</seg>
<seg id="323">Shortcuts for tasks that are carried out by modules can be set in menu under settings Shortcuts.</seg>
<seg id="324">Further information (in English) about KIPI modules can be found via the KIPI project via http: / / www.kipi-plugins.org or in the Manuals of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The settings of the Diaschau should be easy to understand. the top knob adjusts the time between the picdives, usually 4-5 seconds well. the other checkboxes will switch on or off, which appears at the bottom end of the images while viewing.</seg>
<seg id="326">The camera features show a list of all supported cameras on the left side. if you want to use a camera that is connected to the computer, make sure that the camera is properly connected, switched on and in the picture mode. there are currently serial, USB and USB / FireWire mass memory.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom end, you can set the path for USB- and FireWire- (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) mass storage camera. you have to specify a USB or FireWire mass storage camera from the camera team. you have to specify the path / mnt / camera or / mnt / or, on which you hang your camera.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use your digital camera with & digiplug; you need to connect the camera to your computer, and turn it into display mode.</seg>
<seg id="329">Try out whether & digicame; the camera automatically detects; if not, you can set camera models and port manually. after you have set up your camera, your camera will appear in the camera.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any name for your camera. this is displayed in the main menu of the main window. if you have more than one camera, you can insert all here.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the confirmation dialog for the moving of &gt; images in the trashcan display, you can set the talk of & digious; when you drop a photo in an album. in the sections drop a photos and deleting of an album, you will find further details.</seg>
<seg id="332">The editorial changes due to the right side bar can be shut down through & digious; if you use the option changes in the right side bar without consideration. otherwise you must apply the changes to the button changes.</seg>
<seg id="333">You can also sign the display of the welcome screen of & digious; when starting. this accelerates the starting procedure from & digious;.</seg>
<seg id="334">The adjustment when you are looking for new photos, select & digious; the basic folder was deleted by & digious. this lengthens the start time of & digious files; if something from the base folder was deleted, & digiplug; you know if it is to delete it from the database.</seg>
<seg id="335">Various color schemas can be used in & digious; in order to adapt the main window to your taste. these settings can be chosen below settings design from the toolbar. a preview of available designs is listed below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs are defined in simple text files. if you are interested in creating a new design for & digiplug; you will find more information about this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">& digicame; contains a quick image processing with some basic tools. you can use them to view your photos and for correction and improve. image processing can be started by clicking a click with the left mouse click on the preview and selection of the entry / Edit menu.</seg>
<seg id="338">The image processing contains a number of tools to improve your pictures. some of them are available as modules in & digious; therefore, you are not part of your distribution. further information about the KIPI modules can be found in the context of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status line at the bottom of the window, the filename, current file number, magnifying factor and the current image size.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top edge and below the tool bar for quick access to the most common required functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The editing functions change your photos. none of the functions will change the original photo, before you have used the original photo, before you can not restore the original photo, once you have saved the original photo, once you have saved the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">So you should possibly install a copy of your image before you change it. you can save it with file.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can restore the original image by using the Edit menu or restore the image processing in the toolbar. then you will lose any change that you have carried out in the photo since the last Save.</seg>
<seg id="344">Virtually every action of the image processing can be reversed or restored. the last action you can undo by editing, or restored by selecting Edit from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you are using this frequently, you should make your key shortcut, Ctrl; -z for feedback and Ctrl; -Shift-Z to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">When you select the & LMB; through the residual or restore button in the tool bar, select a context menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all actions in between are reversed or restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you started the image processing, you can move between photos in the same album or the same keyword in the tool bar, picture high, image down or the entries in the menu. if you have made changes on the current picture, you will be asked if you want to save them.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can get in the photo in and out zooming in which you ctrl; mouse wheel or symbols in the toolbar or the entries in the application menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adjust a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: select magnifying factor automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">View full screen mode showing the photo in full screen mode. if you don't want to use the Esc key. if you don't want to use the Esc key, you can also call this in the Settings dialog. if you don't like this, you can call this in the Settings dialog. you can also call this section for setting up the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="351">"" "if you want to print the current image, you can select the image in the menu image and get the Standard & kde; print dialog. you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo." ""</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu, you can select individual images or whole sentences. you only need to select the images with the standard methods. if you follow the wizard, you only need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The digiplug; main window has a side bar on the right edge, which provides important information and actions for the selected images. the same sidebar is available, also available in the picture processing, if one of the five riders is clicked on:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple click on the same tab lets the sidebar appear and disappear again in the edges.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the lettering view, you can enter labels with unlimited size or paste. note that all special characters are allowed. the labels will be copied to EXIF and IPTCs, so that you may be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data will only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are cut according to 2000 characters. if you want to use the IPTC label in other applications, you should consider these restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you commented it, use either the button User or just switch to the next picture, the labels will then be saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">Besides the user button there is a button more. you can also read further metadata from the selected file or the database. however, you can also select the metadata into the files. however, this is always carried out when you have a metadata adjustment that is always written in the images.</seg>
<seg id="359">The rating section shows an evaluation scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in searching and sorting. it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the sidebar or with the key combination Ctrl + 0... 5. to rate multiple images at the same time, select this and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The evaluation is written into the IPTC field. coding follows the scheme in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The Keyword view displays a search box for filtering the keywords, the keyword tree, and a selection box with previously appeared in this & digious session.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword will be dynamically adapted to the given search word. you can quickly retrench the number of possibilities in search of a keyword. this ability is especially useful if you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom is another relief in input of keywords in a picture series. if you typed various keywords, they will be saved for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set by marking the appropriate check boxes in the tree. all keywords of an image are stored in the IPTC-field keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If several pictures are selected in the main view and select a keyword in the keyword tree, this will only be applied to the highlighted picture, if you want to choose a selection with a keyword, please read the keyword filter section.</seg>
<seg id="366">The sidebar is used to change the selection of images shown in the main window. normally, the left sidebar is used with their album, - data, wort- and search views. if additionally, one or more keywords filter will be used from the right-hand side, only the sections of these two are shown. all created keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also dress and place them. suppose you have selected multiple images in the main view. if the keyword already exists, you can simply drag it out of the right side bar, and then you can put it on the selection. then, a dialog appears if you want to put the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the top example, the main window displays the pictures on one calendar day. the keyword filter is reduced to three images. they were drawn with Ctrl + a and after that, a keyword will be drawn from the right-down tree to the selection and put it on. a dialogue asks if this keyword is to be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes will take place every start of the program. it can also be switched on under settings.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created, and determine that it should be one or not, you can easily change this with a double click on the text and in the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry, which is searched in the database. this can be an album, name, keyword, pattern, key term, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator, which is a name or a string that is already stated in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can specify a Advanced search through all elements of the database using the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, just need the check box at the end of the rule and then use the button grouping. you will see the options as follows:</seg>

<seg id="376">This article / Tutorial was written primarily by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I have mostly adapted to & digious; s concrete implementation adapted.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why one is using a coloradministered workflow, the colors that have actually photographed or scanned colors are the colors of your camera or scanner. with a colourless workflow you can reach the colors on your camera or make the colors that you print or publish on the web to them from your digital dark chamber.</seg>
<seg id="378">If the topic comes to colour management, everyone wants to know which buttons he must press for the results that he wants. additionally, the sense of this tutorial is to give you sufficient background information about color administration. additionally, you will make links with deeper information to make your own informed decisions.</seg>
<seg id="379">When your picture-bar meets all six criteria listed below, you don't need to worry about color administration.</seg>
<seg id="380">They work on a monitor that is calibrated on the sRGB color space. (please find more information below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other picnimprints are by e-mail or the web, where sRGB is the de facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB works so well and the life for all so simple is why you should then use another color space and thus have thoughts about color-managed life?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of the limitation of sRGB compared to the colours we really can see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors that we can see the hufeisenshaped region, and the colors in the sRGB color space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some bigger colour spaces, please visit Bruce Lindblooms excellente page and click on Info and then on Information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I need to kiss my monitor if I decided to work only in the sRGB color space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! if you're working in the sRGB color space or not, you need to pull your monitor. if you are working in the color space of sRGB, then you must use either your monitor on the sRGB standard, using a suitable monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections that can improve a picture in most cases. therefore, use it before you try a further manual processing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions normalize, identical, automation and contrast extend from the menu Corrigize automatic correction automatically try to make your colors the best. you will need to experiment with these effects to watch what's best on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scaled the Illumination values above the whole picture, so that the darkest point black and the brightest spot is as bright as possible without its colour shady. this function is often a magnetic correction for pictures that are dark or washed.</seg>
<seg id="391">Aborted: this method adjusts the light weight of the colors of the selected image, so that the histogram of the intensity is as flat as possible. sometimes it has produced very good results in improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it produces only trash. it is a very powerful operation, which causes either miracles in an image or it destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic aborted: this method maximizes the colour range in red, green and blue channel. it calculates the dark and bright boundary tones and adjust the red, green and blue channels to the whole histograms zone.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast Extensions: this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values on the maximum possible area and a re-jiing of all values in between. this is only visible in washed images and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white leveling of & digious; is a semi-automated tool to carry the white abnormalities of a picture.</seg>
<seg id="395">The tinting correction is a bit limited to a color space with 8 bits per color. if you can run too far from the original image, if you are able to do so far from the original image, if you work in 16-bit mode, your possibilities will drop better to the correction.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white abnormalise copyright protected by Pawel T. Jochym. you start the menu entry of colors of white image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview can be adjusted in size. on the left hand side you will see both the original image and preview of the target image. if you want to see the original whiteness settings, click on the subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target photos has a red markers. the Luminance of Pixels under this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">Right above will be a histogram shown that as soon as you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well lit pictures, most pixels are very small Luminance values. with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your total is displayed. the sum is called Luminance.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shadow, saturation and gamma. the shadow ordination makes you improve the shadow of your photos or dimming down.</seg>
<seg id="401">Anstat with the above controls are used, you should use the color-temperature pipette. press on this button and then click on the image preview to use selected color to calculate the colour temperature of the whiteness. in this way, the temperature and green values are set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white image with the list of preferences. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The exposure indexes increases the colors, when more than a color channel of the pixel is overexposed. it will be displayed in preview as pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">Buttons Save as and load is exactly this. each setting of the white image you have set you can store it into a text file and reload later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The button settings will return all filter values to their default values and the corresponding neutral white wine. note that even neutral settings will be displayed a different photo as your original. if you save this, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can set the code output per color channel of the processed image. 8-bit encoding is better suited to high quality images. however, this coding is also needed for high quality images. however, this coding is also needed for high quality images, calculating time and only available for formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog like the processing of raw pictures. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. it can be performed by the subwindow for the helligations. a detailed instructions for use of color profiles can drag the chapter color administration.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool can be found in the menu under colours color correction. this tool provides an integrated way to save multiple color channels and allow you to use them for multiple photos. this is helpful if your camera or your scanner will always need the same error, so you can always find the same correction. in the manual to the audio error you will find further information.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful possibility to correct siege problems is the tool for gradation that you find under colours gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The digiplug; tool colour effects provides you four colour effects, a solar panel effect, a Velvia filter, a Neon Effect and a Canton filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of the chemical processing, solar power was called solar power, also Sabatier, a effect that was developed when they have completed a slightly developed print of a short flash. this result was a partial negatives of the image. this tool was a partial negatively of the image. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect finely.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar energy. at about 50% intensity the picture is chemically possible. a further increase will eventually produce a negative image that is not generated on photopapier.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar panel. the original image is the (1) and the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from a saturation to make the colours brilliant and glowing. try it easy, it embellishes many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for a soundproofed color film of the Japanese company Fujifilm. Velvia offers very saturated color in daylight and high contrasts. Velvias strongly saturated color paints are but also some photographers, especially those who are hardly insane, too much.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neonfilter simulates neonlight on the contrast edges. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slipway repeats the strength of the neon light. for big images, the filter can relieve the whole CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual to change the colour contrast and the luminosity of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors. all your adjustments can be seen in preview. once you are satisfied with the result, use the button Ok and you will be used.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you make a photo in bad light conditions, you can get the opposite problem. also in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation will reduce the saturation instead of increasing your saturation. if you like the results you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool Gradation and the simple candy / contrast / gamma tool, the tool is very complicated to improve the exposure. even if the dialog appears very complicated, you need for the application of use only. concrete the three push below the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of intensity values, an histogram, the active canal or the selected area. under the graph, three sliding windows can be clicked into the inside and that can be moved to change the intensity values of the picture. the left side represents the dark and the right side of the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The simplest way to learn the operation is to move the knob and take care of how the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right hand you can view the original and preview of the picture. the preview is dynamic, based on the settings of the picture, updated. on the left, the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selection box can be set if the histogram with a linear or logarithmic Y-axis is displayed. for images of a constant color, the linear histogram of a single column is dominated by a single pillar. in this case, the logarithmic classification is more useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three knob: the top for the dark tones, the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle sounds, often called gammavalues.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three color pinball can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input rate of the shadows, middle and bright tones. furthermore, there is a button for fully automatic alignment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Gait values: the output values allow manual values for each area. there are also two controllers which can be used in order to change the output values, e.g. in the input rate. the compression of the output values can be used as a background to create while something else is visible in the background.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this knob the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Store as and load: with these buttons, the set values in the file system can be saved and reloaded later. in addition, the Gimp level format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three color pipette, the inputs are automatically adjusted for all shadows, resources and sunshades. select the color pipette that you want to use and click on the thumbnails to set the original image of the histogram for red, green, blue and Luminance channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The Overexposure indikator controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and show you the combined outcome of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it's no effect on the final outcome.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below you can see an example of the application values applied to red, green and blue channel of a photos. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected picture (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left, half of the original and the target image is displayed. the preview will be updated dynamically depending on your settings. on the right side the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modifications channel: this selection box allows to specify the channel, which is modified by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">In addition to this box, two symbols are located between linear and a logarithmic view. for pictures featuring a digital camera, the linear mode generates a wide beam. in this case, the linear mode generates a wide beam. in this case, the logarithmic mode helps further.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move a courteil to the right, e.g. the bright tones, then you can see that these bright tones sounded with darker output and the related image pixel are darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">On the preview of the original photos is a red markings to see. if you want to change this mark on the area you want to change the original value. create a dot on this line and move it up and down, until the value is adjusted to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Store as and load: with these buttons you can do exactly that. every curve that you have generated is stored in the file system and later the file format is the Gimp cam format.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you want this method and the three color pipette buttons automatically create the control points for all channels of the shade, middle and sun tones. activate the color pipette that you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for red, green, blue- and Luminanzkurve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The Overexposure indikator controls all color channels to display superior pixel. if in more than one channel, you get the combined result. this is a indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it's no effect on the final outcome.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black-and-white photo, which has been corrected in the Luminance Channel. shadow and sun tones used with the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original image is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel mixer der & digicame; image processing is a tool to improve the colour channels or change the colour casings of the photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel blender is another sophisticated tool to mix the colour shades of the pictures. you can edit it from the colors channel blender of the screen processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the canalselection box you can select the color for the histogram. this gives you a first note how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash. the left area of the window shows you a preview of. the original can be viewed by comparison of your own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red marker. if you move it in picture a vertical line in the histogram to show you the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">The controls for the module are on the right below: controls for red, green and construction allow you to change these channels. if you enable Luminance, you can also use the corresponding color components. this is especially convenient if you can also reduce the corresponding colour components. try to reduce the Flash-and-white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix Monochrome, the reduction in a visible color will emerge from the same place. if this is the case, you can improve your Monochrome conversion in which you can reduce the color of color.</seg>
<seg id="447">The Save as and load buttons are used precisely for this purpose. any concurrent Mixer allows you to save and then load. the used file format is the Gimp-channel format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The Overexposure indikator controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and show you the combined outcome of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it's no effect on the final outcome.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been adjusted. the original image is enabled. you can see the original image below (1) and the original image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photograph was always fascinating because of your abstraction. with the development of digital photography, black / white is a work step, since color images can be easily converted to the computer. also with a set of film roller profiles.</seg>

<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a green line filter. this looks good at all scene images and fits particularly well to Portraits in the sky. so similar to the 004 Cokin (TM) GrünFilter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orange: simulates a black / white film exposure with a orange lens filter. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and air photos. thus, similar to the 002 Cokin (TM) oranges.</seg>
<seg id="454">Red filters: simulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter. this creates dramatic cross-effects and can simulate lunches for daytime. so similar to the 003 Cokin (TM) Rotfilter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a yellow linear filter. this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 Cokin (TM) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiaton: creates warm bright and medium tones during it a bit cold in the shadow of a pressure and the redevelopment in a sepia. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 005 Cokin (TM) Sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">With the digiplug; tool texture, you can apply decorative textures on one picture.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image, regardless of it's a color picture or not, you can look like an oil painting on a canvas, a pop art portrait of enlarged points or as a wall picture on a wall. the menu entry image texture can be used for it.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: move this parameter to the right increases the depth of the depth or three-dimensional texture of texture.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper texture effect has been applied on the picture below. the original image is (1) and that changed under (2). the parameter relief has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With the digiplug; add tool frame can be added a decorative frame around one picture.</seg>
<seg id="462">The eye of a viewer's eye is no easy task. a possibility to keep his attention is to put the picture a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier for the attering eye. in the frame of the frame, the module can be started.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter you set the desired cream type for your image. permanently, the image with a colored line, Niepce surrounds it with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black and white pictures), with a nice three-dimensional frame which is ideal for a touch of touch and decorative add a ornamental frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: specifies the width of the frame in percent. the value range for width is limited from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">This target range becomes bigger than the original, but have the same aspect ratio. this is important for the print of images, especially when you cut the tool after side ratios before use.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this practical tool, you can insert an easy-format text into a picture of any location. this also includes several places when you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply type the text and place it with the mouse. the larger the image you need. the larger the picture, the larger the character set must be. at the end, simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi-transparent background.</seg>
<seg id="468">"" "any setting that you have chosen for your text can be changed until you click the button" "" "OK" "". "after the image has been saved, the text is part of the image. it cannot be changed anymore." ""</seg>
<seg id="469">With the digiplug; tool template apply you can put a template about one image.</seg>
<seg id="470">The Edit Photo template in the image processing can be used to put templates on a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For stencil there is no restrictions regarding size and orientation. if you want to add the PNG file format and you should add a maximum compression (9) to add file size. if you want to add an e-mail in English to the digiplug; Mailing list digicame-users @ kde.org..</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for the first time, you need to put your template folder with the button basic folder in the dialog. select the folder in which you can copy the template files.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder for stencils has been set, a tree view which reflects the folder structure of the template's folder. the selection of a folder is updated automatically.</seg>
<seg id="474">Under the preview there are three buttons with which you can change the magnifying factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button increases the underlying image. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Size: this knob resized below the underlying picture. it is centered around the position of the mouse. if you want to apply the template onto the whole picture, check the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this button to postpone the picture below the template. take the image and place it on the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK if you want to apply the template onto your image. then the image will be adapted automatically.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digicame; manufactures three different tools for sharpening. each of you have advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but creates especially in dark areas, grained pictures.</seg>
<seg id="481">The sharpness mask works on the contrast of the edges to look sharpened. in fact, it doesn't work a bit, it works more mentally. you can use it a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and he is protected by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Focus might be the best of the three because it really improves the sharpness. it is a little complicated in its application and has different parameters for adaptation.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digitalized images need a correction of the sharpness. this is the same thing that sharp edges are put together with only minimal differences. the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras normally need more retrofit than normal cameras for the private application.</seg>
<seg id="484">In JPEG pictures, a camera has been applied internal sharpening. images in the raw format against it must always be weakened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">A few scanners apply a sharpening filter during the reading of the image. if you disable this, you get control of your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get useful results by sharpening a photo using the sharpening value. you can call it with the menu entry corrigating sharpness.</seg>
<seg id="487">But you should fix it carefully, as the results are not very natural. the sharpening increases sharpness of edges, but also amplify the noise. in general, you can focus on the menu entry. in general, you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crunchy. the solution to draw a bit less than it is much easier than it. use the tool for softwarfare with the menu entry corrigation softly and experimenting with Settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter must be sharp masks is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and the preview help edit the picture. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values produce often good results and should be tried first. if you make the sharpness mask deeply, noise and impression of grats will generate near sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius poses as many pixels on each side of a cante affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow greater radii. you should therefore print images at best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount is added to the percentage between the original and the wisely image that is added to the original. thereby, the strength of the edge is placed.</seg>
<seg id="494">The swelling value is a fraction from the maximum RGB value and the amount of difference. you can thus define a minimum difference thus for a cante of the filter. in this way, areas with a soft change between sharpenes and therefore beauty errors are avoided in faces, skies and water surface areas.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the unsharp mascate filter. the original image is the (1) and the processed image (2) and the processed image has been applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a swellvalue = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The digiplug; tool refocusing refocuses on a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyright protected depressing filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries to create a picture & quot; refocussed; in which it's a technique called FIR Vienna filtering. this is using a technique called FIR Wiener Filtr. it is using a technique called FIR Wiener Filtr. you can start using a technique called FIR Vienna filtering. you can launch it from the menu by calling colors refocus in image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circular saw is much better than the Gauß's folding. the Gauß's folding line has a very long tail, which causes the mathematical result too far from the spring blink, which is far affected by the original pixel size. the FIR Vienna Inverse is even heavily influenced by the distant pixels. it causes undesirable results.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular tip: this is the radius of circular folding. it is the most important parameter for use this module. for most images the default value should set the value of 1 good results, but if your image is very unsharp, but should pay attention to halo.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help you reduce artifacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. useful values are 0,5 and the values near 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0,99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpness effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Rauschfilter: an increase in the smoking filter can help you accept artifacts. however, values are higher than 0.1, & eg; 0 is the image quality very bad. a usable value is 0,03. a high value is still heavily polluted.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauß's sharpness: this is the radius for the Gauß's sharpness. in most cases, use this parameter to avoid annoying artefacts. if you use a value zero, you may also have to increase the correlation and / or the smoking filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrizenith: this value determines the size of transformation material. however, if you choose great values for the circular tip or the Gauß's edge. note that the module is very slow when you select major values for this parameter. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The Save as and load buttons are used precisely for this purpose. any refocus parameter you have set is thus stored for later and can be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to execute all encoders, color and intensity skultures on the picture before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module, before you can change the image otherwise. the reason for this is that much operations make changes not immediately visible, but later left uncomfortable artifacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you read and compress images, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, unsharp masks produce better results than sharpening. this could cause this to be causing unsharp masks a bigger neighborhood than sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically, unsharp masks must always create artifacts. even under optimal conditions, it can never show the effect of the impermeate filter. practically, the result of the FIR Viennese filter is always at least as good as the immacity mask. the FIR Viennese filter is often better when processing small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can view a comparison between different filters, on a small, focused image:</seg>
<seg id="511">This image has to be corrected. this picture has been taken with an analog camera. the unfocussed result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information about the methods of focus in digital images, you can consult a technical comparison in English under this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The regulator spreaded the sharpness of the range of the dark zone, in order to create a more natural Pupille.</seg>
<seg id="514">Colour tints allows the customized colour for Pupille. if you want blue eyes instead of dark, then you can set this here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool's image error correction is one of the most advanced tool designed to remove the desired artifacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The infeed algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS Labors in Caen, France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains various preferences than Starts to simplify the restoration. the available preferences are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings, you can use the rider smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detail-keeping p [0, 100]: this controls the maintenance of details. a small value leads to a uniform gliding over the image. what is needed to suggest larger values mainly homogeneous regions and details. a value of 0.9 should not be avoided. please note that detail protection always should be subordinated.</seg>
<seg id="520">Accuracy addiction alpha [0,100]: a small value smoked evenly into all directions, while a value is near to 1 only in one direction. if you generate a high value wave-like pattern. JPEG artifacts are best removed at a value near 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smoothing [0, 500]: this sets the maximum glasses factor via alles. p then defines the relative smoothing. therefore, set this value matching the degree of smoking in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects greater structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is needed, as it is difficult to generate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' Turbullet effect, it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: are there how often the algorithm is running through. usually 1 or 2 is enough.</seg>
<seg id="524">Anisotropic alpha version [5, 90]: angular-dependent integration of anisotropic alpha. if alpha is small, it should also be selected too. take this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral stride length [0,1, 10]: integral stride length in pixels. you should avoid the value of smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never larger than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear interpolation use: the More to quality you get through the choice of this option is only minor. it doubles the runtime. we therefore recommend it to allow him out.</seg>
<seg id="527">Buttons Save as and load does exactly this. any setting of image errors can be saved in a text file and later reloaded.</seg>
<seg id="528">Image errors are comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a long time and take a high CPU load. you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the button crash.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how image errors have been corrected with little artifacts. the module is shown on a photo that was created in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you can see it is a peculiar movie storage during the trip. the original image is below (1) and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digious; smoking reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce image noise. it uses a protected algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable video filters, to remove stains and other artifacts, e.g. dust or hair on the lens, too. it can also be used to remove sensors from the camera or Moirealism; effects from scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need further information about digital cameras, you can read them in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screen picture above shows a typical scene that has been made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grain size, which can be used successfully with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the subwindow and the Advanced Settings menu can remain at the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controlled the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter. great values improve the time that the filter is needed per pixel and can be used through the radius described by the radius and the color in it is smoothed and thus smaller mistakes are adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sharpness. this value sets the pixel pitch of the filter to be fixed. if it is increased, you may need to re-adjust the edges of the filter. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details cannot be obtained and rushing down again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge accuracy of the sharpening. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong, not the entire room can be removed or roughness can occur. if you want to remove a weak rushing or JPEG artifacts, you want to lose weight without details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the lightings of the image. we recommend to change either color or lightdensity to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the glass process which is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Colour: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend to change either color or lightdensity to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the glass process which is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the Gammatolerance of the picture. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of darker areas, which typically are stronger, however, also the shadow areas.</seg>
<seg id="541">Absorption: controls the adjustment of the phasenjittering absorption. this value is defined as quickly the adaptive filter radius on variations of the luminance. if it is raised, the edges can appear. it can remove noise and Phasenjitter on the edges. it can remove noise points and is the recommended method for it.</seg>
<seg id="542">Store under and load: these buttons are used precisely for this. all parameters for the noise reduction which you have set can be stored into the file system and then loaded.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how the reduction of your life can change. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected (2) was applied to the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crunchy for your purpose. the solution to draw a bit soft, is fortunately much simpler than a picture to shark. use this tool for softwarfare and experimenting with the smoothing. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digicame; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools for photo artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for restoring gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artifacts from your pictures. it is very well adapted to remove snails, scratches, scratches and local mistakes produced in digital, original or retroactively digitised images. thereby, the smoothing occurs along the picture contours and thereby gets the content as it also makes human eye.</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for colour and texturing. the algorithm has been developed using another tool, image error correction. the algorithm for restoration was developed by the IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS Labors in Caen / Frannich and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG artefacts reduce: the compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas, it creates some compresses & quot; artifact quot; - small standards that are in uncompressed image. this setting should correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">Buttons Save as and shop make exactly this. each setting of photo restoration can be saved in a text file and later reloaded.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a long time and take a high CPU load. you can therefore break the calculation at any time using the button.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can reduce the picture of a photo with a uniformulation of 3200 ISO.. The module is applied to a black and white photo that was recorded with a Minolta (TM) HP-5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the notorious film grains on the faces. the original image is below (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of the photo restoration. this time textures can be seen on an old colour picture taken with a scanner. you can see the scan artefacts created by scannerlighting and the photo vulture. the original image is below (1) and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The & digicame; Tool Hotpixel makes it Hotpixel of photos that have been fitted with a CCD camera, eight were used to remove algorithms from the JPEGPixi project, which are protected by copyright by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, dead, or hot pixels are a problem with high quality raw mode photos, as many cameras have JPEG compression via a built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot Pixelquot; and "quot; bright Pixelquot;" there is no manual method to select the bad pixel.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file in the wizard with the button dark. the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels. these are highlighted in the image preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera, it is important to record the dark picture directly in the connection to discover new hot or light pixels by CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should find the matching dark picture to the correct picture. an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixel. note that the wizard will reprint the last nightfall and recharges this automatically in the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and the preview help you correct the result in the image. the thumbnails shows the output of the filter with the current settings. bad pixels are highlighted in all segments.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area to preview the defective pixel on the preview and the results of the filter. then select the best filter method to polate these pixel pegs. these are the available filters:</seg>
<seg id="561">Duran: an average of the neighbouring pixels is determined. the resulting colour is assigned to all defensers in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation this is done separately for horizontal and vertical lines.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are dragged to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to polate the defective pixel in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are moved to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim), which is then used to polate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Kubisch: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are moved to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim), which is then used to polate the defective pixel in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the Hotpixel correction on a color photo, from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposures. the original image has been increased to 300% (1) and the corrected image is below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The & digious; vignetting correction is a tool to correct the vigneting, i.e. underlined corners, an image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide angle lens, especially those in the medium and large photo format, frequently illuminate the whole sensor range not equally light. instead & quot; vignetting quot; (shaded) they can reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the sensor captivating. TeleObjective could also show this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">But he has drawbacks. many Center filters need a factor 1.5 or 2 at the aperture filter, which is impossible to hold the camera by hand. wide angle lens should also use with center filter, an opening of f / 16 or less, as otherwise sense effects are caused by movement.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the large exposure ranges of digital cameras and film scanners, it is possible to simulate the effect of a CenterFilter by using an equivalent transformation in a body image that is made without these filters. the tool is protected by a Centerfilter. the algorithm is protected by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">Using three shelves, you can control the vignetting correction filter and with three further parameters of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light starchy absorption at the point of the largest density to compensate the filter. the default density is 2.0, or randomly offset the density of a greater degree of vignetting, reduce it to offset a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Leuchstarch, contrast and gamma-settings: the editing of an image with the vignetting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels. you have to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options. the controls provide you only positive values, as you just need to raise the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a finer re-adjust of exposure to finish, let the values for luminosity / contrast / Gamma at zero and use the gradation of the digiplug; picture processing from the menu color gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the vignetting correction to an image. the original image (1) shows the correct picture in the corners and (2) the corrected picture. a denial and contrasting correction was also performed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The digiplock is a tool to correct the effect of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a protected algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortions. colour distortions cannot be corrected using this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second gradient handles the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third degree has a similar circuit effect, but laughs at the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient of fourth grades corrects the remote corners attached to that of the second degree. if you combine these two geometric distortion, almost eliminated is eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">General: this value controls the strength of the distortion of the second degree. with negative values, tons of distorted distortions are corrected and positive values of conscientious obstruction.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the power of distortion fourth sedes. this value is stronger on the edges than in the middle of the picture. for most lenses, the 'corners parameter has the opposite sign of the parameter General.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value scaled the image size and thus leads to the correction of the first degree through. negative values enlarge while positive the picture shrinks.</seg>
<seg id="583">Light: this value adjustment the brightness in the corners of the image. negative values reduce the brightness of the image in the corners during positive values they increase.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, illustrates the dialog with a preview of correction. the values you use for your image are stored and used for the next start as default values.</seg>
<seg id="585">The broad / resp-shaped correction was to be performed prior to all cutting or size changes. best, you perform this correction as all first. if you want to recut a picture and then make a broad-shaped correction, the effect would become apparent.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction line you will find this tool a vertical and a horizontal auxiliary range. move it to an important place to fix the dotted lines. in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this place. in the connection you can correct the broad / kinsular distortion with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">"" "if you correct a cylindrical distortion, the resulting image will have black vertices. you can remove this with the cutting tool transformers from the image processing or the zoom regulator of this dialog." ""</seg>
<seg id="588">For most pictures the broad-shaped correction is sufficient. the next logical step for some motives, such as recordings of the front, frame and paintings are the perspective to correct the angle in the picture 90 degrees. note that if you hold the camera with your hand, you will always have a slight distortion of perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the broad-shaped correction applied to a church in Norway. the original image is below (1) and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method to simulate infrared movie of the GimpGuru.org website which is accessible under this URL. the filter reproduces the known Ilford (TM) SFX200 Iinfrared film, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window, you can select the area for preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse, you can view the effect on different parts of the image.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview you can add two parameters to adjust movie grains and movie sensitivity (ISO). the ISO knob changes the quantity of the grains and dominance of color green (chlorophyll in nature) in conversion. green meadows are white as snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filters color channels are mixed for reproduce infrared film, especially the green channel makes it no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos since the colour information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared optical filter used on a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original image is set under (1) and the original image has been set to ISO 400. higher ISO values generate a kind of aura in the branches.</seg>
<seg id="595">The digiplug; filter film shelf is an easy-to-use tool to reproduce film-grading on your pictures. this is of classic high-speed movies such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X. to increase the sensitivity of the films, the makers mix great silver grains of the photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The filmstrip effect gives your photo a certain mood or appears to move back into the past. if you want this special, gallery-like, street photographic, grazing sight especially in your monochrome photos, you have to use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">Using the regulator, the ISO sensitivity can be calibrated to control the intensity and granularity of grains. the default value is, although often higher values are needed, on ISO-2400. if you need more grains, then you can apply the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the filmstrip thickness onto a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and that worked (2). the used film sensitivity is ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digious; filter oil painting generates the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digious; filter oil paintings gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting. natural pictures and stylistings are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two controls to affect this effect. the top elects the pin size between one and five. thick brushes are better suited for great pictures. smoothing the smoothness or, viewed from the other side, the charist.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with (1) and the original is marked with (2). brush size for this 640 pixel size is 1 and smoothte 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digicame; filter charcoal drawing uses color and intensity gradient to produce a cabbage in drawing. therefore images whose gradients may change slowly but are not ideal for this effect. it is helpful if you could have chosen that scene you could have chosen to sketch. this would be good pictures to start with it.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controls with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper knob elects the pin size and the lower adjusts the contrast (smoothte).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the carbon copy filter. the original image (1) and the changed image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The digiplug; filter engraving shaped your image in 3-D, as if it was stamped in wax. it uses an protected algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The digious laser engraving is a fast tool to give your pictures again with a 3-D effect. it works particularly well with images with a simple structure, with which color is not the most important part of the content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the picture into a grey, monumental landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows the contrast of the filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10% is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the processed image (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by distortion effects. it uses protected algorithms of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Shaft block 1: dividing the picture in cells and looks like it is considered by glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Shaft blocks 2: analogous to the shaft block 1 the image is distorted here with another version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require a long time to calculate and create a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects anytime with the button.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo in a work of art by means of impermeate effects. it uses protected algorithms of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom Influff: wiped out the image along sternable lines leading from a centre. this simulates the impermeation of a zooming camera and thus creating a dynamic expression of often in sporting photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial Unity: wipe off the image by rotating the pixels at a point. this simulates the impermeation of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distance unsharpness: wipe the image to generate the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object appears back in the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Movement of motion: wipe the image through horizontal movements of pixels. this simulates the defuse of a linear moving, z: B: from a car or train photographic, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Soft sharpness: wipe the image soft into the dark and strong in bright tones. this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos, or add a warm and subtle glow.</seg>
<seg id="620">Shaking: wiped the image by random shifting of pixels and simulates the sharpness of an arbitrary moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent Insharpness: finds the paddling pool in the picture and wipes them without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: share the photo in rectangular cells and then create it by the filling with an average pixel value, new.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require a long time to calculate and create a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel this calculation at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="624">The shelves are a nice small tool to make regentropes on your image. this makes it natural pictures an awesome look. it uses a Pieter Voloshyn protected by protected algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Drip size allows the size of the drops to change. since the size of the image is not automatic, it is often necessary to reduce the size of the image. number changes the number and density of drops. Fischaugen changes the optical effect of drops in the image.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can hold with the digiplug; image processing a range free from raindrops. use the range of tools to choose the area, e.g. a face that will remain free of charge. if you start the filter regentropes, the area will remain free from raindrops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the Regentropfen Filters. the original image (1) shows a quiet sunset and the painted picture (2) indicates a sunset over a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can bring it through mirrors or rotating in the right orientation. you will find the tools transformers in the transformers, rotating respectively.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo inflatable is definitely one of the most advanced tools designed to enlarge a photo at a minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">A picture to shrink is simple. the big question is how can you inflate an image and keep the details sharp? how can you reinvent the missing information again? how can you reinvent the missing information? how can you reinvent the missing information here? the CImg algorithm is here a good job. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo is the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. select transformers size change in the menu and specify the target values. the dialog is below.</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool for the size change uses a linear interpolation method to enlarge the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality, then try the tool for inflating.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many educational programs use a kind of polpolation, e.g. Spline interpolation to enlarge one image. & digicame; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo set was developed by the IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS Labors in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You need to say the tool like you want to change the size. these settings are available in the tab new size and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Maintain side ratio: if this setting is enabled, at entering the new size, the aspect ratio of the original image is maintained.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects greater structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is needed, as it is difficult to generate the geometry of the image. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh' Turbulence effect, it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">Buttons Save as and load are used exactly. each photograph for photo can be saved as text file and will be loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo inflatable is very fast when it does, but it can still take a long time and take a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see an example of the picture below, by increasing a small color image to the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged image (3). the preview (2) is the result of the linear standard enlargement comparison.</seg>
<seg id="640">Cutting a photo is not only a common operation, but also a common tool to put together a picture. simply to cut a photo with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and pull the rectangle, you will then see this rectangle you'll see the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">When you release the mouse button, the area of the photos will be cut out. you can change a good overview of how your photo would look like. you can create the size of the right area by clicking on the corners of the rectangle, by using a new rectangle using the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cutting table, use the button The Cutter button of image processing in the tool bar and the photo is cut (Ctrl; + X). use the file Save or Save file under the file to save the newly allocated photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the foaming process, you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog remains.</seg>
<seg id="644">"" "in the tool" "" "Cut aspect ratio" "" "you can specify the orientation as high-format or horizontal format. in the high format, the larger value of height and in the cross format is always assigned." ""</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool after aspect ratio is used to cut a relative aspect ratio. this means that it is always the same as if you use centimeters, inch or any other physical size. you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo vulture and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog, two buttons are to be automatically centered horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">Below the dialog you can set with the Max. ratio button to cut the area to the maximum possible depending on the chosen ratio and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool can be cut according to the aspect ratio (horizontal or vertical). if you are using the cutting tool, these settings are stored in the EXIF tables, so that the EXIF data will be reflected in the EXIF data, so that the EXIF data reflect the cut image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">"" "" "" "the settings of support help allow help to dazzle out, so that you can put your images better. these help are:" ""</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonic triangle: harmonic particles are based on the principle of similarity. like the third party, harmonic triangles are possible to share a rectangle in a similar harmonic triangles.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden middle: the golden middle is a division that is on different natural growth patterns like e.g. the spiral of a Nautilus mussel or the leaves of a Sunflower. it emerges in all possible things we feel as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden division is the Irrational number 1,618033988... and it was already used in ancient Egypt and Greeks used to construct the golden pitch in all times when you put your paintings, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number is derived from the Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc; from where every number is equal to 1 equal to the sum of its two leading figures. a composition that this rule is considered visually harmonically.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden middle provides liquid auxiliary lines when you put a picture together. these help are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden Spiral will bring you good results for your photos. in comparison to the third party, the golden spirals produces a liquid line of the eye through the picture. this type of composition introduces the views along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetric visual river.</seg>
<seg id="656">Another rule is the rectangles of the golden spirals, also called golden rectangles. this spindrangles is used to create the golden spirals. this can be a line or different objects. this somewhat can be simply because without the eye, it will fulfil its task.</seg>
<seg id="657">The golden triangles are also derived from the above-mentioned golden spiral. note that in contrast to harmonic triangles, golden triangles are no equivalent triangles. diagonal to these lines can be a static object dynamic.</seg>
<seg id="658">When you use golden triangles to break your frame, create a effect of creating professional photographer dynamic symmetry. try to place your image focus on one of the chives and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot reach differently.</seg>
<seg id="659">The options horizontal reflect and vertical mirrents can be used to reflect the harmonic particles.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button color you can set the paint of relief lines. if you have a picture of many colors and a high contrast, the relief lines can be invisible. you can adjust the color of lines in your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The free rotation is a tool to rotate an image of any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you make a photo, it's easy to fix the camera not exactly vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture in which the things are rotated by an angle. you can fix this with the digiplug; image processing and the tool free rotation. select Transformations Free Rotation and adjust the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Turn your picture with the slider angle. the values on this slipcase are indicated in degrees. by button settings, you can set the slide back to 0 degrees. a preview of rotation is available on the right-hand side of the window. the new dimensions of the picture are displayed right above.</seg>
<seg id="664">At your help, the free rotation module provides a horizontal and vertical line. move the mouse cursor in the image preview to position the two lines. now you can adjust it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you shot a picture, you'll find unwanted three-like holes in the corners. one way to fix it is to use the function transformers from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the picture is the function Automatic Cut. choose one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The option anti-aliasing smooths the image a bit after the turn. note the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspectival transformations are performed to a fixed point in the so-called reference point. this point is shown in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective, you need to use the red squares at the corners of your picture. the preview will then be automatically calculated. on the right side of the dialog you will find some information which will help you to change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: shows the width of the new image, including empty areas which are created through the transformation.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: displays the height of the new picture, including empty areas which are created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle left: displays the current angle in degrees on the top left of the transformed territory.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle Right: displays the current angle in degrees on the upper right corner of the transformed territory.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle Left: displays the current angle in degrees on the lower left corner of the transformed territory.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle Right below: displays the current angle in degrees on the lower right corner of the transformed territory.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective, the image will be somewhat polluted. for a single adaptation this effect is small, but two adaptations produce a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you have adapted the perspective, you get unhappy dirty holes on the corners. one way to see it is the picture with transformers cutting out of the picture processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The tool is used to move a portion of the picture in one direction and move the other part to the opposite. this is not rotation, the picture is distorted. in other words, a rectangle is turned into a parallelogram. you can start this module about transformers.</seg>
<seg id="679">Sheer your image by pressing the horizontal angle and the vertical angle. you can set horizontally and vertically. if you push for presets, the angle to zero will be displayed. a preview of the effect will be displayed on you and the new dimensions of the target range will be shown on the right of the thumbnail.</seg>
<seg id="680">For your help, a vertical and horizontal line appears. move the mouse to an important point, like e.g. the lake, a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to adjust the lines to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After completing the calibration, the image will get a bit wiped out. for a single shift, this effect is generally negligible, but two chings produced twice as much desolation and so you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After shifting, the image has untriangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate it is the picture with transformers cutting out of the picture processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digicame; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write about image formats. in some cases, you will depend on your system and, in some cases, from the type as these libraries compiliert. in most distributions, you will need a large number of image formats with & digiplug; edit.</seg>

<seg id="730">Load big graphs (currently there are problems starting from about 1000 knots and one hack to display more than this node)</seg>
<seg id="731">Additional required software: & kgraphical viewer; is a & kde; program which presets the & graphviz; tool & dot; for presentation of graphs required. in detail, the following:</seg>
<seg id="732">The main window displays the opened graphs, each in a separate window. at the beginning, when you start & kgraph viewer; without a argument, the toolbar contains only the symbol file and the (empty) list will open. click the first icon to view the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="733">After you have selected one or more & dot; files selected, the main window looks like in the lower screen picture:</seg>

<seg id="810">The KIPI module for geographic localization is available to localise images of geographically in the spherical coordinate system, which is used by GPS and Galileo. height, length and latitude are used.</seg>
<seg id="811">In order to correlate your pictures with geographic data, you need a GPS track as an XML file in the GPX format. gpsbabel and gpsman can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Bild Geographical localization Correlator. this interface can bring a number of previously selected images with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the images you want to correlate to the main window and call the menu on. the above-to-see dialog appears. of course, you need to load a file file with GPX file. this file, of course, contains data at the same time, like the pictures of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">When the file is loaded an automatic correlation, the coordinates is performed in red. GPS trace data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera-time has to be converted to GMT. this can be done with time zone. click here your camera zone.</seg>
<seg id="815">The adjustment for the maximum time deviation is the maximum deviation for the GPS time and camera-time. lies the deviation below, the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you do not have trace data from a place for pictures you can edit the GPX file manually and add to the images. the time difference of 2000 seconds will be correlated all images in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options interpolishing and difference in minutes can be used if you don't have any suitable data. if you know that in reality a location in a big time difference between camera and GPS is, you can set these boundaries here and then press the button correlated to interpolate.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be set manually with this dialog. this is useful when you have made a number of photos on the same place. since the dialog you will need to use the coordinates of a call to the next, you just need to use the button OK to set the data with the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found and set with the shown map and increase it. select this to the respective region and increase it again. the height must always be manually chosen. the card can always be manually selected. the card can be switched between card mode, satellite photo and a mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Completely outside the KIPI module, there are ways to hang the GPS data to the images. here is a small script that the exiftool uses to have a stack of images with GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The KIPI Module gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums in a picture gallery from HTML pages. you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages. the character set is encoded using UTF-8, to provide the best possible internationalization.</seg>
<seg id="823">The module has four riders in which the settings can be customized according to the tab. you need to select all albums that will be exported to HTML. you need to quickly select this albums. in the area below, you will quickly find a large number of albums. in the section below, the Albends and the text that appear in the header of the HTML page will appear.</seg>
<seg id="824">The rider appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each side. this tab has been created largely by itself. if you click on a picture a new page is displayed in which the image is displayed. otherwise, the image will be displayed directly with your standard viewer, & eg; Kuickshow, displayed</seg>
<seg id="825">The tab album defines the settings where and how the gallery will be stored with all your related images. a subfolder with the name KIPIHTMLExport, which contains everything, will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you select the JPEG file format, EXIF data of your original pictures are also stored in the new images.</seg>
<seg id="827">With other color depth, you can change the standard color depth. it also influences the file size. all other settings are inexplicable.</seg>
<seg id="828">The rider shows you some of the settings from the album tab for thumbnails, those are small pictures shown in the gallery.</seg>

<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG lossfree module is a tool to change images without affecting your quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows you to save images in JPEG format, without the usual losses of quality or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of the lossless storage is that the file size increases, because no compression of the colour information is taking place. this can be found, e.g. at PNG format.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI module digital camera client is a tool that allows you to connect your computer with a digital camera.</seg>

<seg id="841">This function does not work with all image formats. you can copy from anywhere, but not in any target format. JPEG is supported when writing. please look at exiv2 to see what formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG Kodierer module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in form of a Diaschau.</seg>
<seg id="843">The MPEG Kodierer module can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG-Video, with a defined length to convert. this module uses the MjpegTools and ImageMagick. you can also add an audio file to the MP2 or WAV of the Diaschau.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images will be scaled automatically to the correct size for the selected video format. additionally, you can create a background color for the selected video format. with this module it is possible to create DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player. finally, you can finally use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">You must first select the images that will be packed into the MPEG Diaschau. afterwards, you can launch the module via Extras MPEG Diaschau.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images selected by you will then be shown in the portfolio under image files. there you can also change sorting the images or the contents of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you're satisfied with your list, you should change the other settings. if you are browsing the file on a TV, you have to select the corresponding TV standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is preset and most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step, you should specify the time in seconds that will be displayed in seconds. a low value produces very sudden, a high contrast very smooth image changes.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set next. in doubt, you should leave them black. you can set the name and path of the generated file under Name of the MPEG-output file. if possible, keep the extension.</seg>
<seg id="850">In case you specify an audio file under name of the audio source file, you can start creating the production of the movie. depending on your computer, you can go to the production of your computer. depending on your computer, you can go drinking a coffee and enjoy the Diaschau when you are back.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a hint appears that Kodierer or tools are missing, so you can adapt the paths to the programs of MjpegTools and ImageMagick Packages to the right below.</seg>
<seg id="852">The printer wizard allows you to print multiple images on one sheet of paper together in standard photovoltaic. the combined images can also automatically be used with the image processing Gimp. this is e.g: useful to improve you or using the Gimp module for direct expression.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module, you can import or convert your images stored in RAW format to one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command line tool dcraw from Dave Coffin. a original quote from Him is: expect the same results as the software from your camera team. sometimes you get better results with dcraw better results!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First, select the RAW file to be converted and start the module. the Raw image Converter window will then appear in mode for a single image. with the button preview, you can view the effect of your current settings.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now adjust the values to optimise the conversion process. the first option decides to adjust the camera settings like gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifier. if the result is not optimal, you can edit the image later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switch has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you're satisfied with the preview, you can save one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. the filename remains the same and only the expansion will be adjusted accordingly. JPEG uses a funniated algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">Tagged image format, TIFF, retains all the information of your image and uses the lossfree LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you prefer to edit your pictures often or later, you should not use the JPEG format, as there is only a limited number of operations before image quality deteriorates. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you select JPEG as a memory format, the metadata is stored in the RAW file in the JPEG file in the EXIF information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adapted your settings, you can start the conversion button. if you want to cancel this process, then you can use Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="863">The pile processing mode allows you to convert different images to one time. therefore, use this mode if you are safe, for instance by testing in a single picture, which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to the version for individual images. however, you have the possibility to automatically overwrite the file. this is helpful if it is not available in an earlier test. however, a preview is not available as far the conversion has been advanced.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to compress all images in an album. it convert the program convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used for renaming all images of an album. you can set the prefix, the starting number and timestamp of the album.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of multiple images of a picture collection. it is used to make the convert program from the ImageMagick package. you can make the image shrink or enlarge. four types of image change are provided:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in dimension. width or height of the image is automatically selected, depending on image orientation, the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): size change in two dimensions. this option remains unchanged. you can use this option for example to adapt your picture to the screen format.</seg>
<seg id="870">Not proportional: proportional size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed at this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Printing preparations: prepare the image for the photo print. the user can set the print resolution and the size of photopapiers. the target image, with background size, border size and background colour, will be adjusted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected images with your preferred E-mail program. it is also possible to change the size of the added pictures before. more pictures can draw on the list of these images and lay there.</seg>
<seg id="873">After which you started the module, the images window with the selected images will be displayed. you can add more images via the button to add to a file selection dialog. for the last chosen picture, a preview of the right page is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also draw pictures to the picture list and add them to the list of the pictorial images.</seg>
<seg id="875">With the button images you will remove the selected images from the list of the pictorial images.</seg>
<seg id="876">After you selected all images, you can open the new message window of your e-mail client with the button OK. you just have to add the addresses and the subject. the images selected by you are attached as Appendix.</seg>
<seg id="877">Do not check out too many pictures at once. most e-mail accounts have limitations for the size of e-mails. it is possibly a good idea to send several emails when you want to send a lot of pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window will be used to change the settings for sending the images. your configuration is stored and used every time until you change them.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your e-mail clients from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you have to specify the right path for your installation.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you use the Google Mail service, you must install the Gmail agent on your computer before. you can download it here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After the selection of comments in a attached file, the comments on the images are joined to a text file and the mail is resolved.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format under the menu image file format is not very suitable to use the size of photo files, but it is best adapted among the lossless formats like TIFF. you should therefore have to use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed. otherwise, we recommend the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG under images file format and use the original files in JPEG format, then the original Exifications will be added to sensing images.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is finished, the window will not be closed automatically, so that your e-mail program will be started automatically, but your e-mail program will automatically start at the end. with the button closing, you can smite this window.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the module advanced Diaschau, a window with questions like you want to view your slide show. you can choose between the albums selected and all pictures of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">The OpenGL-transitions option in the presentation use very elegant photo outputs using OpenGL. however, you need to have a corresponding graph card since otherwise the slides will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The filenames command ensures that the filename of the images will be displayed in the lower left corner during the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">The loop line ensures that the presentation is displayed in a loop loop. afterwards, you can manually interrupt it with Esc.</seg>
<seg id="889">The option images randomly select that the images are displayed in random order. so it will not be used in the order of images in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">With delay between the pictures, the time interval can be set between the individual images. 1500 milliseconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect. so you should watch this out before you show your friends!</seg>
<seg id="891">There are more than a dozen transitional effects between which you can select. by chance you choose a different effect on every transition.</seg>
<seg id="892">During the Slideshow you can access a toolbar at the top left side of the screen. move the mouse to this corner to switch to you.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this tool bar, you can start the presentation and start again, jump to the previous and next picture and stop the Slideshow.</seg>
<seg id="894">At the left side of the screen you can see the current file name, the position of the current picture and the entire number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">The KIPI module time & date has now no documentation. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI Team among kde-imaging @ kde.org. please note: the participants in this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI module background image is a tool to set a picture as a background image for the working surface.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module requires the currently selected image, depending on the select option of the submenu, as the background for your KDE working surface.</seg>
<seg id="898">Once you have signed your pictures and videos with remarks, you can see with & kphotoalbum. by these browsen, see picture. as you can see by a comparison with the image, in persons, places and in group keywords.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window you will find the categories, for which you typed your images and videos with notes. additionally, there are entries to look at EXIF based information to view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course the current thumbnails. in the following one is described for each other.</seg>
<seg id="900">When you press the mouse on the entry, the browser will change. see picture.</seg>
<seg id="901">If you want to select another person only the pictures are displayed, on which both persons are visible. by this selection method, you can limit the number of images displayed by a few thousand pictures on a few images.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have selected all the people, locations and other settings, you can view thumbnails to view the images of your search area.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture each person has the same icon in front of her name. they can store with & kphotoalbum, but of course for each person a separate picture-picture, this is of course also for places, keywords and other categories that you have defined. see the image.</seg>
<seg id="904">In order to view images next to the name, select the button that you need to set the view on the toolbar. in the appearing context menu, you can select the view for each category separately. in the appearing context menu, you can indicate that you can display the icons with images from people and simultaneously a list of keywords (if you don't have any suitable images).</seg>
<seg id="905">You must decide, however, to select which image is displayed for each individual person. in order to view this, you need to select the image editor, as shown in the picture. in the context menu, you can customize the image for the appropriate person. in the Ansification window, you can select the magnification factor according to your wishes, which should be displayed and cut off.</seg>
<seg id="906">If you want to locate the entry in the main window, a dialogue will be displayed, which is very similar to the dialog for finding the image properties. this dialog can take you on the picture again.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you want to enter a string into the field label or description, you can also enter a date or descriptions of the images to search for; the date can be either a part of the total date, i.e. 1971, or the complete date. you can also use a range of two data, such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the lower part of the window, you can browse all the pictures according to certain names, as you can see in the picture, on which Jesper, but not Anne Helene are depicted.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user manual for & kphotoalbum;. if you don't like to read manuals but prefer to try out functions, you have the following alternatives to this handbook:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the homepage of & kphotoalbum, and check out the quick entry, screen photos and introductory videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & start photoalbum in the first dialog, if you start & start photoalbum; for the first time, or choose the menu entry kphotoalbum; -demo. thereafter, some sample images will be loaded and you can try out the features of & kphotoalbum; try it out.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print this handbook, you'll find it on the homepage of & kphotoalbum; as a connected HTML document to download.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom of the main window of & kphotoalbum. see the timeline. a picture of this strip you can see here: how the name already says, this bar will show you data statistics about the pictures in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">The timeline can display several different time units. every body shows a different unit. you can switch between the units, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing the bar only 10-minute sections.</seg>
<seg id="915">The timeline can be viewed in the following ways: you can change the displayed preview view from the database (if you select a Date in the preview pane) and also displays the timebar the current date of the currently displayed pictures, if you navigate in the preview pane.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select an area of time line by pressing the mouse button, and the mouse over the ruler of the time line, i.e. the time signature, will draw you only pictures of this period. you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of time bar.</seg>
<seg id="917">& kphotoalbum; provides you with two options available to create HTML websites with your pictures; integrated and the other as a module is available (see). in the following part of the user manual, the integrated version is described in & kphotoalbum; integrated version, which you can create via the HTML menu...</seg>
<seg id="918">Before HTML pages you need to make some settings. these are divided into the three areas of content, layout and purpose. in the following, each section is described in more detail.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, enter the title of the review and a description, which should contain the HTML file later. on a photoalbum; HTML example pages you see an example of this settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, choose whether a & kphotoalbum can be created; the export file is to be seen on the reviews page. more information about export files can be found in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Lastly, you can select which information to be displayed on the HTML pages. for example, you can see that information is displayed without description. for example, all pictures are displayed. you can't use this setting to hide specific images from certain amount.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this area, you can specify how the HTML pages should look like. most options are clear why not specifically made.</seg>
<seg id="923">At the bottom of the page you can view different resolutions for the images. thus, those you have to consider your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution of 800x600, no images that have a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewer's viewer can change the resolution at any time you have defined. it can, therefore, search your images with low resolution, leading to a lower transmission time, if he wants to get a larger image, it changes to higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setup area, place the different folders and the URL where your website is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">Best select for all your HTML files a base folder and for each subsequent set a new subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="927">First you need to select the main folder where all your images will be saved. this folder will be stored and next time you can select the location. here you can select either a folder or a KDE support protocol, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your pictures, you can check if these really are all visible to the viewer. if you choose a URL, a web browser has been created. the URL where you can set up here should be this folder. otherwise the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If you don't need to manually copy the HTML files in the final destination folder, you need to manually copy them to the final destination. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the basic folder in which all subfolders there are.</seg>
<seg id="930">The options described above have referred to all three in basic folders or URLs. in these, a subfolder is created, whose name you define in the output folder.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you're on a family party, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & kphotoalbum. you can, of course, want to add a HTML page to viewing the images. you can, of course, take a HTML page for viewing the pictures, then you'll have to take up with & kiss album, then do not have to do this work once again.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & kphotoalbum; you can export a copy of your pictures into a .kim file. these can import others to your database. the image characteristics are imported with ex- and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in the file only if the images are stored in the file or if you can store all the images into the file, so that you can download all the images and pass this file so independently. however, the obvious downside is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can either export a .kim file directly from the File File &gt; or along with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file together with a HTML file, this will create an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file searches the images in two times. at first you go through the images that you have entered in the .kim file. this is of course only possible if you have created your .kim file using HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">Below is the dialog for exporting images, which you can export to the Export menu...</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is to act on internal or external .kim files. the following three choices are available:</seg>
<seg id="938">For the Manually to the .kim file, you must copy the images in the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the option Automatically copy the .kim file copying & kphotoalbum; the pictures automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal Zip files. since most images have already been compressed with JPEG, it is normally not worth to compress the files. if you wish to compress this, simply select the Export File.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is maximum image size limit. if you want to send your friends images, the .kim file would otherwise be very large. here, you can limit the size, by example, that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and broad.</seg>
<seg id="942">When you import a file with the extension .kim from the web browser or from the menu file Import... select & kphotoalbum; the exported database as described in.</seg>
<seg id="943">The assistant for importing consists of four steps. first you need to select which images you want to import, after that, in which folder the import images should be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you are interested in the category persons of the imported file (if you are a Dane), while this category is called for your database. therefore, you will be asked in the third dialect, which categories that are imported into your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step you can compare the categories of the import file with the categories of your current database. an example of this is shown in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="946">It must be easy to browse pictures and watch: when looking at pictures, you often want to see images of your Italy vacation, and if you look for example images of your Italy vacation, you may want to see a picture of your friend on it, you may want to see all images on which this friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this handbook you will find the different steps from (1) to check out the information about your images, via (2) searching and prestige, up to (3) advanced topics and adjustment possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoAlbum was started as a program to manage your pictures. however, it has been extended and today your videos are taking place. many places in this handbook are spoken about images, but frequently it includes videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& kphotoalbum; store all his information in the file index.xml in the top folder of your pictures. this is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice, e.g. Normal backup tools, copying to a diskette or revisions in CVS, where you want.</seg>
<seg id="950">& kphotoalbum; notice the folder where your pictures are stored and used this with future Starts automatically. if you want to read another folder in & kphotoalbum, so you can start a different folder with images, so you can boot & kphotoalbum; using the -c option. as example: kphotoalbum -c ~ / company / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Over the menu entry settings kphotoalbum; set up... enter a window with which you can change the settings of & kphotoalbum. in the following section of the user manual, you will be explained the different settings.</seg>
<seg id="952">On the left you can see six different symbols, with which you can call Settings and options for the viewer. for each setting a detailed help is available, which can be retrieved by buttoning to the F1 key and click on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">In you, as you can set for each image different properties, e.g. persons, places and keywords. you can also create your own groups such as items, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">You can see the dialog that is used to process existing groups. for each available group you can choose a label and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the subcategories, subcategories have already been mentioned. in the dialog box, you can set up complete members of members, i.e. all members of a group at once in a group instead of all groups of an association as described in.</seg>
<seg id="956">In view of the options available to the fixed list of members, you can select the category which you want to configure. in the left side of the list, you can select a list of the current category and in the right a list of subcategories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& photoalbum; shares his module system with other graphics applications, such as digiKam and Gwenview. this modulation system is called KIPI and means & kde; image plugin interface. more information can be found on the Kipi homepage.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be accessed through the module modules, since they are not described in this manual, as they are not part of & cphotoalbum. however, most modules have a help page, which you can call through the module itself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules of several applications are used together together, it may be possible to test the modules with & photoalbum; this is why you should always call up new modules with the command &gt; kphotoalbum -demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or via the Help menu. don't say, I wouldn't have warned you!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that use the modules over KIPI can be very different, making it possible that some modules with & photoalbum are not working. this is the disadvantage if you share functions with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & cphotoalbum; and other applications, who also can use KIPI, is that the other applications are not supported in albums. even though & kphotoalbum, this kind of order is not supported, so you simulate the order for several modules, so that you can use the features of & kphotoalbum.</seg>
<seg id="962">Here's simulated & kphotoalbum; the current album, which just corresponds to the current view, so see all images that show you the picture preview right now.</seg>
<seg id="963">In addition to the current album, & kphotoalbum, the modules also has to pass a list of albums. here's a photoalbum, as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & photo album; s browser showing the contents of a category, for example all persons, then each entry in this category represents an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will be the category that you have defined in the settings dialog as a category for virtual albums, for example, if you are interested in the category individuals, so do if you have selected people to view and pass the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & photoalbum are not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. start the settings dialog, and select the module that modules are to be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example of a starting screen when you start & print a photoalbum; start with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used by any other KDE application, you can see the window on top of a menu and a tool bar. at the moment, you will find no more information about your images. in the section, we will find no more information about your images. in the section, we'll see you on this window, but now click on the pics here showing an overview of all existing pictures.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main features of & kphotoalbum; is the possibility to see each image with notes, where the image has been recorded, etc. you can use each image either individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time. if for example, images are shown on all images of Jesper and all images taken in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these comments can be used for searching and browsing how you can read in the section. if you want to see this comment when you use the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">In view three lists with a text box by setting persons, places and keywords. these are a very important part of & cphotoalbum, as you can always use them again, when you enter information about your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is based on the shifts of images within the list: for example, if you have a family celebration, and on all 50 pictures the same 5-10 persons are shown, so that the used names are moved up, the persons can be found faster and assigned.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer a alphabetical list, please click on the icon for sorting by date.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected comments on each image, you might want to edit all the selected images and apply these images with notes. in this case, simply click on the images and back buttons that are under the thumbnail to the top.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have several pictures, e.g. with the same person, then it can be more convenient to mark all these pictures and apply the menu item Several entries at a time with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA. San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">In the picture, see a browser window that shows the USA as overgroup. to show you that it is an overgroup, a special symbol is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of the menu dialogue it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over- or Subcategory. in addition, you can also extract an entry into a category and place it in order to make this entry into a subcategory of this entry. see it in alphabetical order of your categories.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can move the individual elements of the collection dialogs, press and move the bottom edge of the frame, click and postpone. you can also make a separate window by taking it outside the window area.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adapted the look of the window so to your needs, you are satisfied with the settings, click the button options..., which allows you to save the current layout and the look of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also leave a frame completely. if you want to see this window again later, use the button options... and then click window to / out. see this procedure in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the entry images in your browser, you will get an overview of the thumbnails of the currently selected images, or all the images you don't have a filter. for example, you can see the size of the thumbnails, by simply pointing out the mouse with the middle mouse button, configure. try it simply.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you drop a picture on the background of your desktop, this image will be set as background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">Once you click on a picture, this is displayed in the picture viewer. if you have no window opened with an image viewer, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete images in the imagery show. simply select the appropriate pictures you want to delete and press in menu Edit menu. now, you will be able to select the window that you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& kphotoalbum; it offers you a solution for this problem. you can also use them on your hard disk, so you have to record the pictures somewhere, thus & the photoalbum. in the picture you can see the picture of & kphotoalbum. in the picture you can see the picture of & kphotoalbum. in the picture you can download all the required images from the hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="987">Pictures where the right upper corner is cut, are not stored on the hard disk. this is, for example, to see the pictures 1-9. for the pictures 5-9, however, the thumbnails are available, giving you the preview of these images. you can also watch these images with the picture viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you can see this feature, you need to copy files out of folders and avoid copying them again. if you don't want to avoid hitting file sharing of your pictures, please buy a larger hard drive to store all images on it.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the menu images you will find a sub-menu with your name privacy. if you want to stay a little more privacy, you can check out the images that you want to see for other inaccessible and click on current viewpoints in the menu privacy. alternatively, you can also lock all the pictures you want to lock and lock the menu.</seg>
<seg id="990">This way, you have defined what pictures can be hidden in case of the case. if you want to insert the laptop with your little sister, simply select the menu entry. if you want to see the pictures, click on lock.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to specify a password which must be entered to unlock the images. to set up this password, simply select password in your privacy menu.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please remember that this image protection is by no means very safe. you can find out all the images on the hard disk and the others can read or delete the password as unencrypted text, for those who are able to stay on the file index.xml; it is not very familiar to the view on private images.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason why you can manage all of your pictures with & kphotoalbum; you can manage and spend hours over hours, of course, that you want to look at them sometime. from this reason & kphotoalbum. from this reason has a picture _ and video viewer. you can preview it from the preview as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">The viewer can see in. of course it shows the picture, but additional all information you can enter about the picture, such as who is made on the picture, when and where was it done, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If you want to see the InfoBox on the upper part of the picture, you can simply drag and get somewhere else. you can also configure the information displayed and whether all these options are available after a right click on the viewer. then you can see the upcoming Context menu below.</seg>
<seg id="996">Some words in the InfoBox are underlined. if you click here, the browser is displayed. if you click on Anne Helene, the browser will show you all the pictures of Anne Helene. as if you select individuals from your browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have loaded more pictures on the viewer, you can switch between them and return by clicking the buttons below and jump down. you can reach the first and last picture with Pos1 and end. these functions can also be reached from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If several pictures are loaded in the viewer, you can run them as a slide show. & kphotoalbum; then invites you to make a new image after a few seconds. how frequently it can be controlled by pressing the Ctrl key and plus or minus. started and stopped by the buttons Ctrl; S.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful ability to change & kphotoalbum; it is used in full screen mode. in this mode, the viewer uses the entire place on screen. just use the input key to switch to full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">When you use the viewer you can get in the picture and get out into the picture. with the Minus button you can rash the Plus button zoomt into the middle of the picture. shows how a zoom box is marked and displays the result of the zooms.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the dot key you can reset your zoom, so that the image is not drawn zoomed. with the right mouse the zooms, so that every pixel corresponds to a pixel image of the image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zoomoperations work for videos that are in and out with the plus and minus.</seg>
<seg id="1003">With the rotation functions from the context menu, you can turn the picture. this does not work with videos. you can make remarks on the current picture with the menu item notes from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">If you look at pictures, you can find a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten on the picture. in the moment you can view the view and give the configuration dialog of the picture, in order to mark those names. but they may prefer to mark the image and look at other pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of pictures to a printer to see the pictures on paper. to see what photos you want, you can start the viewer with the pictures and select them as good or bad, while you're one after another.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, the viewer gives you the opportunity to view images with features, while you're looking at them. features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature that you can press the corresponding letter. in you see an image where the features A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">Once you have set features on your pictures, these are available in your browser. so you can see all the pictures you edit, print or whatever you have chosen, so you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD, or whatever you want to do.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and special features can be displayed in the preview screen. if you are looking for categories in DRE Vorschauview, then you can add features to the images, simply press the characters for the feature when the image has been selected. this can be seen here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it's not clear what you want to show on a picture. for this case allows you & kphotoalbum; to paint on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The painted old is not stored with the image, but in the database. to the type you can undo the mixture later.</seg>
<seg id="1011">In fact, you can see a picture depicted on the painting by & kphotoalbum. to turn on, select On the picture paint from the context menu. in order to finish the painting, simply press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To work with & kpovmodeler; you must not rule the application of the program & Povray; but the documentation about & Povray; should you absolutely be read and understood.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object tree, you can select individual objects. then, their properties are displayed in the object properties and displayed in the wire-frame views yellow.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select several objects at the same time. but not the object of an already chosen object, as all subjects have already been chosen with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To add a new object to the object tree, select the place where you want to insert the object and select either the icon in the toolbar or select a menu entry in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are possible positions, the following drop-down menu will be displayed, so you can select the correct position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">With delete either from the menu bar under Edit or from the context menu of the right mouse button, you can remove selected objects from the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have changed properties, click on User to take these changes. if you have invalid values, you will correct a message with a error description. then you can click the input errors or reject the changes with disrupting.</seg>
<seg id="1019">When you enter the path to & Povray; enter user documentation in the setup dialog, you can call the & Povray; reference to the displayed object.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user documentation to use this feature. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 already contains the user documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">If you edit a texture or part of a texture, you can see a preview in the peculiarity view.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Press preview in the peculiarity view and a small example of the scene is given to the selected texture. if you want to render the whole texture, even if you want to rename a texture inside a texture map and not the entire texture map), check locally.</seg>

<seg id="1035">If you have created a scene you can rendering it. & kpovmodeler; used & Povray; 3.1g for rendering, this program has been installed properly. this version is not currently supported in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0 is not supported.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To render the current scene, click the Rendering symbol Rendering the symbol Rendering in the toolbar or select the menu entry mind scene.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A Render mode is equivalent to the entries in & Povray; s ini files. he determines the image size and quality of the rendering. if you want to rename a scene in different sizes and quality levels, you can add any number of Render modes, from a quick preview up to perfection in the highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the toolbar icon or in the menu view Render modes, select the following dialog:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each Render mode has a name. you can enter any name, but it makes sense to recognize the properties of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the card box size you can enter the width and height of the packed image. if you want to renounce only a small area of the image, select the check box section and enter the picture-section to the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In combination with quality, you can select the properties that are used & Povray; for rendering, this is from a very simple colour and light model to a model with complex diffuser reflection lighting. a detailed description of the rig properties you can find in the user manual at & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If a painting is rendered with only a beam of pixels, there can be different mistakes. these images are often not displayed in curves and lines, sometimes details are not displayed when a pixel are smaller than a pixel. this effect is called Aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the influence of these errors. generally, images with this property are better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">When you switch anti-aliasing, calculates and connect & Povray; more than a beam per pixel. this technique is super sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super sampling. as a standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; recursively because each pixel is continually splitted and adaptive because each pixel depends on the calculated color values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you choose the first method, POV-Ray pursues a beam of pixels with super sampling. if you calculate the depth of pixels with a fixed number of pixels with super sampling. if you calculate the depth value to 4, a grid of 4x4 points will be calculated, with a low value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional rays per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 rays per pixel. if the difference between the color value exceeds the predetermined threshold, then the pixels is divided into 4 sub-pixels, which can be pursued separately and on further subdivision. you can adjust the maximum depth of the recursion.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another possibility to reduce the aliasing effect is called Jittering. if you turn Jittering, change & Povray; the rays have a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The final setting for the quality of renderns is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental property of & Povray; diffuse diffuse light-flexion. it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this map, you can set if the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent, if the associated rays have no object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for displaying & Povray; console output. if & Povray; unexpectedly, you can find the reason here.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & Povray; select the menu entry file Import... and select a file in the dialog window.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently supports & kpovmodeler; not yet the full command set of & Povray; when importing error messages or warnings, a dialog window displays a list of messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not support source code in & kpovmodeler; import, write this source code between the two special comments / / * PMRawkin and / / * PMRawEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for & Povray; this adds the source code to the property into the editor. to import objects into the scene, simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With copying and paste in & kpovmodeler; and in your editor you can add source code for & Povray; also paste.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & kpovmodeler; one scene is rendered. usually this is Povray or x-Povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">When you click on the Help window, opens & kpovmodeler; the & Povray; user documentation to the displayed object. set the path to your document projection and version. it supports versions 3.1g and 3.5.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; searches for external files (for example altitude data) in the paths to the & Povray; libraries. if you enter files, you'll also need to enter the path to these files. if a file is found in different paths of the library, the first found file is used.</seg>

<seg id="1064">The color of the rectangle for the visible view in the camera view and in the window-type symbols.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can set the points of the points on the grid in the context menu of the wires model. you can set the grid separately for shifts, scaling and rotations.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values result in a precise wire model and thus a better result for the displayed objects, but require more time to rendering. for some objects such as the ball, you can set the detailed press for two directions separately.</seg>
<seg id="1067">When you cross high detail equipment for extended projections, all wires are used. advanced projections are all projections with exceptions of perspective and the vertical projections. this feature gives a better rapprochement for projections, but requires more time to rendering the projections.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you cross a wall, a wall is mounted behind the objects. the wall is displayed in a box pattern made of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you cross the floor, a floor is framed below the objects. the floor is shown in a box pattern made of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you tick the canteen, the non-recursive antialiasing method for rendering the scenes is used. the values for depth and swelling can be set. precise information about parameters can be found in section Render modes.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page you can change existing window orders or create new window arrangements. in the section window directs will be explained how to create and store window orders.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The drop down selector field order: displays all existing window orders. & kpovmodeler; uses the chosen window arrangement at the start of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list of existing window orders shows all existing window orders. a new arrangement you can create with the button add and delete a selected alignment using the button.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Each window arrangement is identified by name. the name must be clear and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list below shows all views of the selected window arrangement. new views can create with the button Adding and delete selected views with the button.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The new window's position. with New column, you create a new column on the right side of the existing window, with locks, set the window under the existing window, with the previous view and showcate the view not in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you have just worked & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installed and now you want to begin with no more precise knowledge of both programs. if you can open all steps in this tutorial, you should be able to create the ultimate, simple scene: one bullet on one level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should carefully consider following warnings before you decide to make sure that you use a black screen as a result. if you use a 3D program for the first time, you should consider these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you do not set a camera, you can't use any rules for rendering, as a result you get a black image.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you do not include any light sources, your whole scene is dark and you will only receive a black image.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have installed everything flawed, you can see at the first start of & kpovmodeler; following pre-set window order:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to learn the menus and the available symbols of the tool bar. please read the documentation so that you can get an adequate idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">These menus and symbols will now often have to use, so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this guide, you must first remove all objects from the object tree. then select the scene and select the menu entry to delete. so you have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wireless model view shows how the camera is considered the whole scene that you create. in particular, you notice that in the fourth wire model view (right below). this is the view of the scene from the scene of the camera. this shows you the outcome of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new record with the name camera. if you click on it, see the content of view object properties where the different parameters of the camera are found. in user documentation to & Povray; you will find further details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Do not change anything in the basic settings of the camera, this is reserved for later instructions, but note that the camera in the view control points can change with which you can change the focus of the camera. just click on a control point and drag it to the desired place.</seg>
<seg id="1088">When you press the button User or the input paste, the wire model views and the slide show instantly change these settings. as a result, they look at the scene from the point of view of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the ground for the scene. you could insert a Quader for example (Insert big body Quader) and the size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a permanent method of solving this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; in fact a simpler way. you can use an infinite layer as bottom:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: choose the level in object tree, change the name and press the button User or the input paste. in the object tree the new name will be displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wireless model view now indicates the level, even though at the moment only as a limited level. if you render the scene, the plane extends up to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If you're looking to view the object tree, you will find that you'll find the different parameters of the object. in this case, you will see the different parameters of the object. in this case you will find only the default options for each new object: scaling, turn and shift. select one of these options, also change the possible settings in the view of object properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene you should move the ground to exercise a unit under the horizontal line, only to get to know some of these parameters. select shift and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First, select the floor to adjust its material properties. there are many different materials, but select slightly faches in the moment.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases a dialog opens in which you can select as the object is to be inserted. please select the name in the object tree. you can preview the name in the peculiar view (Name = bottom Pigment), with a click on the button preview, like the Pigment looks right now.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, you'll have to preview the pigments only a matt black material, because you can always check the pigment settings at any time with a click. now enter the colors for the pigment. also, there are many possibilities, but now take the easiest option.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you look at the preview no color on Quader & Ball, click on the button users and then call the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the ground is right now. if you render your image now with a click on the symbol, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course this is not the color. you need to add two new attributes. in the color list, you need to select two new attributes. then edit this entry twice (you can also do this more frequently, but the chess board colour list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">In each object tree, choose plain color and change the colors in the view of the object properties:</seg>
<seg id="1102">This step, you should already be able to use this step, as you have already understood the basic working mode of & kpovmodeler; the ball can be just as simple as the floor:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the object properties you can immediately change the settings. place the ball contact with the ground. otherwise, the ball contact the ground. otherwise, the ball would float above the ground, as you have shifted the ground to one unit.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, the rendering is a strange result: as already before, the ball surface appears like a matt black material. put in the following step a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have selected the ball, you can now assign a material to her. like at the bottom, give the ball a pigment than colour:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select the first subobject and change the name for example in ball Pigment. click on Ball Pigment, then select insert and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can achieve interesting effects if you take time to adjust some finish properties:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values like in the following screen shots and click on application or press the input paste.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The settings shine-effect and reflection already result in some good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromed surfaces, even if metal is still not selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of what offers you & kpovmodeler; hopefully, you have already learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytracycing is a Render method to create a two-dimensional picture of a three-dimensional scene or model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">When you raytracen a scene, the renderer's hypothetical rays derived from the view of the viewer (i.e. from the camera that will reflect the scenes) through the objects in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog will work. thus, the scene is edited for pixels.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you will see nothing without a camera, the camera is your eye, with which you can see the scene. without a light source you can also see anything, the image is simple black. obviously, every scene needs to be diminished, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog you can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Open a file. in the default file dialog you can select a file that you have previously created using & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open a new model, the file will be inserted into this submenu and replaces the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you have already saved the model, it is stored under the same name. if it is a new file, you have to enter a name and memory.</seg>
<seg id="1118">The scene is reproduced in the last saved version. all changes since the last storage are rejected.</seg>
<seg id="1119">This menu entry allows you to select only if you haven't stored any changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeat the last update. this menu entry allows you to select only if you have editing feedback.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Saves the current window system and opens up a dialog where you enter a name for a new arrangement or overwrite an existing arrangement.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu, you will find options for setting & kpovmodeler; here you can change the look, the button and the default behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog for changing the keyboard shortage. you can change or add a dialog for & kpovmodeler using this option.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Open a dialog to set up toolbars. you can add and remove the tool icons for & kpovmodeler with this option.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A bump-map is a way to apply rough surfaces without modeling any diffraction on the surface and without change the geometric shape of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is common to use the same file both for a Bump-Map as well as for a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic body are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models will be produced from dozens of or even hundreds of these basic body. these models will then be processed to give them a realistic appearance.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture-map is a way to specify the surface of an object color on pixel basis by applying an image file as a color card.</seg>

<seg id="1188">With the help of DCOP you can exchange your scripts with Amarook and Amarook. the simplest way is to use the command dcop; which should include every KDE installation.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripting languages allow external programs and commands. in this manner, dcop &gt; is mostly used. this way, dcop &gt; can be called relatively easily. here is an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& Amarok; sends notifications to all running scripts. for this reason, you will continuously monitor their standard input and respond accordingly to events. of course, a script should ignore the events if there is no use.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure Weis the script to display the setup dialog. in order to store and load the setup data, each script must be started. whenever a script is started, Amaroystok sets the working folder to the folder where all data should be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1192">TrackChange signalizes, that a new piece is played. the script could now query & b; with DCOP functions more information on the new piece (for example, metadata or unit length).</seg>

<seg id="1195">Before & Amarok; stop, or when the user stops a script, sends & Amarok; the signal SIGTERM to the script. this signal should be processed, e.g. upgrading of data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amoks script management can also install script packages, which can be downloaded from a web server. such packets are basically normal Tar-archives (.tar), which can be optionally available with bzip2 (.tar), which allows the user to clearly detect the archive as a Amarook script package.</seg>
<seg id="1197">& Amaroystok; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the Advanced Dobserver script. for this reason, you should rename your script packages directly.</seg>

<seg id="1486">In addition to the general & DCOP; functions, which have all & kens; program in common, supports & K3b; mainly two other parts, which are described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The standard DCOP interface from & K3b; features functions such as copyCD, formatDVD and other functions for creating new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">DCOPref createmovixDVDProject () DCOPref createmovixDVDProject () DCOPref createmovixDVDProject () DCOPref createmovixDVDProject () DCOPref createmovixDVDvd () void burnCdimage (KURL url) void burndvdimage (KURL url)</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject method, you can create a DCOP reference on the newly created project: # K3b --audiocd and then a reference to the project via the # dcop K3b K3b K3b interface currentProject By using this reference is possible to change the project via K3bProjectInterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the above-listed K3bProjectInterface and the powerful K3bDataProjectInterface, which can only be applied to data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">Void createfolder (Qstring name) void createfolder (string name, Qstring parent) void pstring (KURL:: list URLs, Qstring parent) void renameItem (Qstring path) void renameItem (Qstring path, Qstring newname) void setumeID (Qstring id)</seg>
<seg id="1492">This makes it possible to fill out a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, several folders and then adds files to the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT = $(dcop K3b K3b interface createDataCDProject) dcop $PROJECT createfoldbar / foo dcop $PROJECT addurine / home / truce / somefile.txt / foo / bar</seg>
<seg id="1494">& kaudiobe; is an audio CD; read-out for & kde;. with him you can easily read audio CD; it can be read and installed in MP3- or OGG files. other formats are possible, depending on the encoder that is installed on the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& kaudiorem; is the interface of cdparanoia (for reading & CD; data in WAV files on hard disk) and of many codiers that are encoded as default (encoded files) and FLAC (lossless compression). more codes can be added to the program (if they have been installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First the tracks of the & CD; read and stored in WAV files on your computer (loss-free and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">Are usually compressed in a second step of these WAV files (usually one per title) compresses in the MP3- or OGG format or other formats like the lossfree FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, read out the & CD; it is used by & kaudioars; cdparanoia. almost every distribution has compiled a pre-compiled package; if this has not yet been installed, this must now be done.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step, lame (for MP3), oggvorbis (for OGG) or other encoders have already been installed, so it is very likely not necessary to compile something itself. but if FLAC doesn't need to be used, its installation is not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1500">What Kodieraser / File Format should be used? the chapter Welcher Kodierer gives a small introduction to coding, audio quality and compression factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word to copy protected audio CD; s: as already said, uses & kaudioz. with cdparanoia for reading the audio data from the & CD; if not, it is possible to handle any copy of copying; if not, it is possible to avoid any copy of copying; even if not the mechanism of copying it is possible. avoid copying the copy of the copy protected audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While setting up only once has to be done (the setup dialog has to be found so often called up to a suitable configuration), after the daily use of a & CD; it will hopefully lead to understanding for the slim approach of the user interface, which will often be stumbled at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert many formats - depending which coding programs are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">Can & CD; get information from the FreeDb from the Internet or can work completely without network, where everything is manually installed.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is just a short list of the commands of the main window. in the next step, you will find further information such as this program is used as well as screen shots with descriptions of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1506">If the CDDB is available on request, the CDDB request will be available on request in the CDDB tab. (this can be locally or online, the latter case must first be connected to the Internet.)</seg>
<seg id="1507">Start reading and - if an Encoder has been configured in the Code Shedification Settings section - the coding.</seg>
<seg id="1508">Open a sub-menu with a list of available encoder, so that the selection with another encoder can be read as the default. it is to be noted that before the Encoder has been configured in the Settings dialog, in the Settings dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Opens the file manager, allowing an already pending file to code, instead of a complete & CD; to read and encode.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Open the setup dialog for the type of notifications (as protocols, Piepsen) for programming (such as reading the & CD; finished).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Opens the main setup dialog of & kaudiocia; with different card cards (such as Encoder, for arranging the Encoders). here you have to go before the program can be used successfully!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes audio quality, coding and compression ratios and helps you with choosing the right body.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is to be lost, a lossfree audio format is needed. besides FLAC there are also other like 'horts' or 'Monkey' which may be useful for this distribution. the cons are the low compression ratios and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats, which can lose information by data compress depending on their psychoacic model, MP3 and OGG files are much less important to MP3 in audio quality (up to 128 kbps), but above this bit rate the differences are less important as both of the encoders generate very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O 'not so free' free, but nevertheless delivered with most distributions, but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high to very high sound quality (with high bitrates), but compared to OGG slightly lower quality with deeper Bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer-based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG tuning devices is present.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices, such as standard DVD player, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard disk) or special auto stereo systems. today - at the beginning of 2009 - support these equipment mostly only the MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of parameters for audio quality and the resulting compression ratios for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for further parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium' = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= This setting should usually provide for most people and most musical pieces acceptable transparency, and has quite high quality. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset Extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3 kbps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset Extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate approximately 5.5. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h '= 128 kbps CBR, stereo, compression rate, about 11 128 kbps for all pieces of a title. good enough enough for music by young people, portable devices and car parks. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you want to have absolutely highest quality without consideration of the file size, then select this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information provided by the FreeDb program automatically via the Internet, are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can transfer / needed with & kaudioF; and the code name to create file name and file names as well as the properties of music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with code programs, there are frequently a combination of program settings for the Kodierer and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the Kodierern explain the switch for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example, to add the & CD; Title to the keywords (English: day), if MP3s are encoded with lame, the switches -tt of lame and the title parameters of & kaudiods must be added; the result looks like: "wtt {title}... '.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudioon; parameters that can be used (= button title in the assistant):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the FreeDb is: a free database where you can download / enter the audio CDs instead of yourself to enter the computer instead of yourself into the machine. it is said to note that all other information is spoken instead of yourself to the machine: & CD; Title, artist, name of the pieces & etc;, not by the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal but I (Ancm. of the operator) is not a lawyer. however, no one can prevent you from the & CD; and moreover, the information is not added to the CD; more or less worthless, so neither the artist nor the music business can be hurt. all information can be obtained from a bomel by a & CD; shop, physical or virtuell.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudiozone; it is actively used to select a check box. for the use of FreeDb you can use with another (counterfeit) address. in this type of configuration, it seems that the email address is not used by the server (this can only know the programmer that has checked the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are copies of the main database in many countries. if & kaudioars, used for use FreeDb, the geographic on the next door should be needed. this saves bandwidth in the network and resembles the load between the machines.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org gives a current list of mirror servern for the online retrieval of & CD; for information while reading a & CD; alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) only the database updates.</seg>
<seg id="1535">What identification program is used to store pieces from the & CD; in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There is rumours that cdparanoia is used; who wants to know more precisely in the source code.... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD; it has always been to be installed that the cdparanoia package has to be installed first if this is not done.</seg>
<seg id="1537">For saving the extinct WAV files, the Kodierer can be selected and thus the desired file format. during the first opening, you are pre-defined files for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (a loss-free compression for audio data) on the tab to set up the code. other encoders can be added on this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Kodierer Package must be installed from the respective Linux distribution, before the encoders may be used. this is also necessary for the pre-defined cooperatives. more information about Kodierer can be found in the chapter Welder Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a Kodizer, more information about its switches can be obtained by entering a command like lame -help or lame --help in a console (eg; Console) and must be replaced by the name of the installed code.</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the device name of the & CD; / DVD drive, the write and reading of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for OGGs, flac & etc;) are installed. try both programs with a command line in a terminal block. that could give a reference to what is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you do not want to read a copy protected audio CD; check out the envelope of the & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with one step for example. even if you use other settings, this can give you tips how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, everything understood, but are somehow still unsure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by step example, and you'll get enough information to establish those areas which make the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time, set up everything and read our first & CD; we will use lame '--preset Extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) of 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3v1 keywords (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">There must be cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be found as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution, as it is considered not completely free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files, whatever you can do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please ensure that the directory / usr / share / cd has and that you have write permission to write it (eg; by trying to copy it into something).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers basic setup of & kaudiods; something is probably done only once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the procedure to read out a & CD; what must be repeated for each exiting & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the used Kodierer for compression of music (lame) as well as the resulting audio quality (--preset Extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps). since we are lazy, we share the program with running FreeDb to download the & CD; download data from the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will probably not change them when reading a & CD at any time, if once the matching settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name is delivered to the readable program to read the & CD; data / pieces can be read.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Often / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your drive. if this can't work or if more than a & CD; / DVD drive can also be accessed with other programs, such a glance into the file / etc / frod and an attempt with the existing entries for the CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">"" "the" "" "General Settings" "" "tab. here there is not much to do. here, an additional conversion can be defined. in our example, everything is shown that is shown as shown in the screen picture." ""</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only inquire in full information so you will be informed when data are missing to the witness of keywords (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1555">The ticket card CD; settings. simply select both entries. we are comfortable and leave the & CD; data automatically via the Internet from a FreeDb machine.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the machine must be connected to the Internet when reading & CD; it can be connected to the FreeDb server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection field is easier, a & CD will be found, when you're later unhappy with the database entry and the resulting directory names / filenames or tag records, they can easily be changed with konqueror &gt; renaming the ID3 tags with Kid3, dem & kde;</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, if you want to manually enter the selection fields and FreeDb is not used. you can choose to use FreeDb locally in Offline mode. however, this is about 620 MB large, you need to select the two selection fields, at least the first one. mode is set up on the following map.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is for us FreeDb. these are settings for the data request, for calling the FreeDb server on the Internet. how do the system know which data should get the CD? read the section through FreeDb. put everything on how it is shown on the screen picture.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we have not downloaded the database, we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB-Server: please go to the site of freedb.org and look at a mirror server in your vicinity. on this way, the load is distributed between the machines. this setting will however work as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both work equivalent to the server, but because many firewalls may boot up the protocol 8880 as default, there is perhaps more luck with the protocol 80 because the & HTTP protocol is usually open to surf on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example, we don't want to transmit data to the FreeDb server. the first check box should be checked.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Simply take the settings from screen image. (make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of simultaneous pieces: sorry, there is a reason why more than one at the same time with only an existing drive? parallel reading and code? the author does not know, therefore just try.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; after reading the last piece: cross it to the & CD; at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">User-defined folder for temporary files: if you are crossed this, then the path / folder can be specified, in which the WAV files is stored. this can not be displayed in the private folder. do not forget to make this folder when you want to do anything with the WAV files.</seg>
<seg id="1568">Everything is as shown on the screen picture. the command is a bit long, under circumstances, something is going to be seen on the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset Extreme 'defines the audio quality of MP3s. as previously mentioned, it is sufficient for a very good audio quality, even for very good hi-fi stereo systems. the resulting bitrate is about 224 to 256 kpbs. the reached compression factor is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the associated entry '--id3v1-only' for the limitation of the creation of tags to version V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2' tags can be deleted from a later change of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the complete path) and output file (including the complete path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Put the rest in the screen menu. some comments for future use outside this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of simultaneously encoded WAV files: at a DualCore or Quadcore or even a multi-processor machine can be tried to encode more than a WAV file at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">This is what we have just finished the basic setup of & kaudio. this configuration is used as a standard for every reading of a & CD; if you have chosen the organisational structure of your music, you will never need to change them again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">This section is described as the process of reading the & CD; it is described in the previous section, as we want to set up MP3 files. first, a connection to the Internet is described, as we want to pick up the software and the CD; data from the FreeDb can be picked up. the process that is described in this section must be repeated for each submitting & CD; to be repeated.</seg>
<seg id="1575">As we use a & CD, which is not yet included in FreeDb, see screen shots a little different than the data for a & CD; therefore, you will learn the & CD; with successfully retrieve it from the Internet, instead of retrieve them from the internet. comments will point to the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Don't try to find the & CD; this example is a 'special' issue of the author this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">"" "if this is not done yet, the & CD now needs to be defined in the drive which is defined in the main window." ""</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment, the pieces and their length should be listed in the window, as shown in screen photo. this only if the & CD; as audio CD, could be read and from cdparanoia can be read.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this does not happen, search in the Questions and Answers after the Help or go back to previous section concerning the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the & CD; successfully picked up from the FreeDb, all titles of the pieces are already filled in and furthermore the name of the artist and the album are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1581">For the case that there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; there is a window that appears, and you can select the database entry, which your opinion is best on your & CD; fits.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you have not selected the check box for the automatic query from FreeDb (on the page & CD; settings in the dialog for Settings), you can also manually release it by choosing the first button in the toolbar. if you don't have local database, you will need the Internet to connect to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 step 02: the CD editor - entering the CD data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; according to the pattern on the next screen picture, enter the title of the piece in the first line of the 'Update', the rest of the data in the 'Album' input field.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist must not be entered in an input field 'Current title' unless you have a compilation with various artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The lower comment field can be used for the individual comments inidicial per piece, the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply to all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Caution: after the successful call of data from the FreeDb is the CD editor not empty, but it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor, so that you are not only able to check out the contents of the CD editor (for example if all words with uppercase letters start or not...), but also to check if there are any unwanted remarks.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example, we use only ID3v1 tags. this is limited to the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist, album, and title of a piece. if you are using ID3v2 tags, you have set up unlimited field length, at least on the code tab card settings; take a look at the Settings section 'Basic Settings'.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the generated files at any time with the tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with him you can also create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by any codes or file formats. see in the help of the Kodierer to receive more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select an entry, which is obviously not important in this example, as we don't transmit the & CD; for more information go to the website of freedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop or rap, for example, are found under rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After choosing 'OK' you come back to the main window. just click on the line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The CD editor's window appears and you'll see that the fields are already filled with the given data, which we have recorded for the first piece. simply type the entries for the first piece. enter the title of the piece in any case and other information you wish.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window doesn't appear when you have downloaded the data from the FreeDb. it is already sorted in one of the categories in the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of toolbar. note that the artist and the album are displayed on the worklist.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there is a check-in before each line of a piece. only the titles are selected. a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece one or off. make sure all the pieces select, or push the button all the pieces on the bottom of the screen to pick all the pieces at once.</seg>
<seg id="1598">By clicking on the button select the reading process appears, this window appears to confirm. click OK and then we will see a look at the window with the entries and follow what is going on.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the tab for switching to the window window. it is in the left upper half of the window, directly under the buttons of the tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to control the orders. the first piece is being read on the hard disk. the status of the program is displayed in the lower part of the window in the status bar.</seg>
<seg id="1601">You can see this error message when you are trying to work with a codec, which you have not yet installed. pieces that have not been successfully encoded with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the file for the TMP file and the target folders are not what we have entered here in the example. have you checked if you have a write access to the folder for temporary files and target folders?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The order 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new entry: order 4 is the coding of piece 1 into the format MP3. to read out and code parallel. note the status itself in the lower part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has no configuration settings to suppress this behavior. the only machine that seems configurable is the result of parallel processes to read and code. when performing machines, the machine used with an AMD64 seems to have no problem with simultaneous expressions and coding (from but two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read out, while another piece is encoded, and a third order is coded in the queue of the Kodierers. after the last piece is coded, a small window will be displayed with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & kaudiods;, you need & kde; 3.x. or 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to create compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG, you need the code of your choice.</seg>

<seg id="1628">As soon as & kmid; play a piece, you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and drive with the knob and drive.</seg>
<seg id="1629">"" "if you find that a song is too fast or too slow, you can click on the left and right of the Tempoad and thus change the speed. to return the original speed, double click on the Tempo- LCD." ""</seg>
<seg id="1630">The space bar has two tasks: when a piece is played, a pressure on the space bar or the selecting the menu entry pause in the menu, interrupts playback. push the space bar while no play is played, starts & kmid; playback.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be saved on two types in a piece of music. some pieces use text event, others use lyrics events and again others. some pieces don't have any text: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid; you can setup what events are displayed and even better: the event type is automatically selected, so you have to manually set the audio text, so you will automatically change the Karaoke text. but you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to set up an event type, select the text settings and property events from the menu settings. the same function also have the keys 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files which you can summarise. these will be played in the series after being played in this section, as you can efficiently use collections.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, first open the collection manager. at first you will find the collection manager. click on New and give the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then specify the name for the new collection. this collection will contain the same songs as the original.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can set the always set out in the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">In the temporary collection all songs you want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When applying the application, this collection is not stored. remember that if you add many pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, it must be selected in the collection manager. there you can add a song to the Collection Manager. it appears in turn the file dialog, with which help you select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on Setting Automatically Add the Collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When automation add to the collection, a piece is automatically added to the active collection (using File Open or Drag & Drop).</seg>
<seg id="1643">When Automatically add to the collection, the temporary collection is activated and emptied when opening a piece. this collection will then be added to the opened pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, select the collection manager, select the collection and select the desired song and then click for removing.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs are played. if you select the string from the submenu sequence of the menu collections, the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">When you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu, the order will be redefined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collection manager, or use the selection list above the Karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To jump to a song, select the next song next song from the menu item, or press the arrow right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To jump back to a song, choose the button pre-previous piece to select the previous piece from the menu or press the arrow on the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection and click the button to delete.</seg>
<seg id="1651">Temporary collection cannot be deleted. however, this does not matter, since it is not stored when leaving & kmid; not stored.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizer, which are not general MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI-Map General-MIDI events will be translated into events that understands Synthesizers.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create an MIDI map which converts all events of the Type Change patch to Bright piano into action of the Type Change patch to Trumpet and therefore always a trumpet sound if originally a piano should play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you only have a sound card, you don't need MIDI map because all sound cards GM -compatible are (incl. Awe - and GUS cards, FM devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">There is no programs to create MIDI maps. so you need to edit the appropriate file of your hand (with your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">An MIDI-map is a text file that stores all required settings for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may appear only once, except the KEYMAP section, which may appear as often as desired. requirement for this, however, that every occurrence has a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">"" "Define PATCHMAP... END Define NO YMAP" "" "Name of the Keymap" ""... "END Define NO YMAP" ""... "END Define CHANNELMAP... END Options... END" ""</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that debaceous is needed to indicate that a section starts (except for Options) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as e-mail, so I can offer future versions of & kmid; support for devices which are not general MIDI compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section is specified, as the patches of General MIDI is shown on your specific keyboard. the general use looks as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the principle is ignored. it is assumed that the GM Patches are in the right order (from 0 to 127), you may not change the order and leave no line for one of 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllKeysTo M is used to make all sounds that require this instrument to play with the number M. if your keyboard supports no tissue shot (e.g. with sound 60), which is similar to a tissue shot (e.g. with sound 60), which is similar to the PATCHMAP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if a MIDI file is supposed to play a patch with patch 127 (Gun), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, regardless of which clay is in the MIDI-file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note, here with the term drum patch of the patch is meant, with which every sound represents a different Percus instrument (drum, pelvis, maracas & etc;), and not the one with which the sound indicates the pitch of the same drum (like some keyboards).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP section is used to specify how sounds are shown on a particular channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">Like the PATCHMAP section, the order of the lines is very important as its presence. thus, 128 entries must be created.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define multiple keywords for each channel and instrument. you only have to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are used mainly to set tones on the Perkussions channel. look at the included keymaps for example.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to connect some channels to others. if you wish to change the first and the second channel, you simply do it in the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are useful for keyboards, which have the percussion on a particular channel (General MIDI to channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, arranged according to the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel that is depicted on channel N. if you are using the Keymap option, you will need to change the Keymap name for this channel. if you are using the Forcepatch option, you will need to change the patch on this channel. in this case patch x will be used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Forcepatch option may be useful for example to always use the Perkussions patch on the Perkussions channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBender is multiplied in which ratio pitch-bender events will be multiplied when an MIDI-file is equivalent to the value n, this is used with the formula n * (r / 4096) and then forwarded it. the value 4096 is used so that in the map file no decimal notation is used.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is used because GM is trying to play a pitch, which is to play pitch with the value 4096, but try to play some keyboards up to one octave. in order to find the correct value on your keyboard, you have to taste a bit with & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI map, just open the MIDI-settings dialog. you can find this in menu below settings, point MIDI settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The canalview is a window with a full range of claviatures (one for each MIDI channel). on this keyboard, you see which sounds are played straight.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the canalview to change the instrument on a particular channel. for each channel, there is a select list where you have modified an instrument. if you have changed an instrument, the button doesn't get green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The canalview (up to now) has two different views to show the played tones. viewing the Settings menu, select Settings menu under the Point Channel View: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The pace-LCD shows the speed, which is played a song. the higher the number, the larger the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the pace of a song. if you find, a song is too fast to follow the text, you can slow down it. to change the pace, use the arrows to turn left and right from the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file that has to be played like a piece of music, it contains the notes, the rhythm, speed, & etc;. thus, the same MIDI file may lead to very different results, just as two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Well, I can't force anyone to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while an mp3 file needs 4 MB (an compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, speed & etc; you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This may happen if you have compiled a binar distribution (rpm, deb) by & kmid; because & kmid; without AWE support has been compiled. to fix the problem you have to download and install a source distribution (for example from kmid; 's start page)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I'd like to add a whole folder to a collection but I do not want to add all files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Agree, that's why & kmid; Drag & Drop. simply open the folder you want to add in & konqueror; select all files, and drag them to the & kmid; window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">Before setting, enable automatic adding to the collection. otherwise, the temporary collection files will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can use the arrow keys on the left of Tempo- LCD to slow down playback. in order to restore the standard tempo you can double click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have on a & kde; desktop a & conqueror; -window with my MIDI-file and & kmid; in this way I need to play a MIDI file or if I want to play a file, only in the & Konqueror; turn the file into the window of & kmid; draw.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you want to listen to a file only once, without adding them to a collection, turn the settings Settings, and the new; file will be added to the temporary collection of files</seg>
<seg id="1692">We assume you have MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid. first you only want to play the first file. so, set the settings Automatically add to the collection and open Amid. your temporary collection contains exactly this a MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then join us also to play B.ID and C.mid and create a collection with all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people have sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you! if I hear these songs or I see the postcard, animated me on & kmid; to program.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid; was written by & Antonio.Larrosa.Jimenez. I'm studying mathematics at the University of Mazurich. I'm studying in my third year, so I'm not trying to take a little time for my hobbies, but I try to collect MIDI files, making music and prove propositions.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you want to know where to download MIDI / karaoke files, if you have a question, an error or an idea for an extension of & kmid; or even if you want to make me happy, write an email: larpink @ kde.org or antennr @ arrakis.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">You really make me a huge joyful anticipation, if you send me a postcard from your residence or a MIDI- / karaoke file from a local group. all those who want to send me a postcard or an MIDI file, if you want to receive an MIDI file, then you should contact me as I might have the file.</seg>
<seg id="1698">I've written & kmid; fully written in my spare time and I don't want to do any money in my spare time. I'd like to emphasise it because / when I get feedback of users (post cards or e-mails).</seg>

<seg id="1701">And of course my thanks also applies to all these excellent musicians on the net, which give us this wonderful MIDI- and karaoke files.</seg>
<seg id="1702">Additionally you can find & kmid; also found on his homepage, which is located under http: / / www.arrakis.es / ~ rlarpink / kmid.html. on the homepage you can track the development and look at links to pages with other karaoke songs, & etc;</seg>
<seg id="1703">A soundcard. I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthesizer, as the sound quality depends on your sound card. it is not the same if you use a FM radio or AWE card.</seg>
<seg id="1704">If you don't have a sound card, you must compile & kmid; with the parameter MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYVISUAL. then it runs as if you could have a sound card, except that you can't listen to music.</seg>
<seg id="1705">If problems occur, contact one of the & kittens; mailing lists or send an error alert directly to me.</seg>
<seg id="1706">& kmplayer; is a simple user interface for MPlayer, Phono and FFMpeg. the program is used to play video files produced by MPlayer or Phonon supported formats, as well as DVD's, VCD or TV and camera.</seg>
<seg id="1707">The documentation for & kappname; was not finished as & kde; installed on this computer.</seg>
<seg id="1708">For additional help please check the page The KDE site on new versions, or send the question to The & kde; user mailing list.</seg>
<seg id="1709">The application window is made of so-called andockable windows. there is always the window with the central view. optionally, there is an information window that will only be displayed if you want to retrieve information inside.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to enrich the preferred connections with the Bookmarks, but these are individual entries. if you want to create a list of entries, which will be played after each other, you should use the category long playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchical level. when you balance an entry, his group and all its subgroups will be copied to the current category and the play begins with the climatic entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' hot pieces', TV and Permanent playlists can also be changed by direct editing of XML configuration files. the various files in the directory ~ / .kde / share / apps / kmplayer / can also be changed by an editor, but also by the application itself. by clicking on a subgroup, only the XML content of this part is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing the XML files, you must be selected from the menu and select either the mode, or select a different category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes are lost when processing mode left or the other group is selected without the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">As a result of the convenience of the author of & kmplayer; some features can be switched on only by changing the XML configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="1716">Animation at startup can be disabled by editing for ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc and changing [General Options] No Intro = 0 observer option on '1'. if the option is not available, it can simply be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate another animation. & kmplayer; will see the files ~ / .kde / share / kmplayer / intro.xml and ~ / .kde / share / kmplayer / exit.xml. the format must be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The starting animation doesn't need to be short, it will automatically terminate by opening another source. this would end with the end animation however, the user can end the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a start-animation can be displaying: & lt; bodygt; & lt; bodygt; & lt; & / / home / Koos / mum.gif "; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; In alphabetical list of testing and some examples of SMIL will be supported by & kmplayer;</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a tab for the configuration of MPlayer in the configuration dialog of & kmplayer;. here, the path from the MPlayer and the cache size of the data base can be set out of the network and other things.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for troubleshooting is the button 'console' in the tool bar of kmplayer. here, the output of mplayer is evident.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no rider for this playback tool in the configuration dialog of & kmplayer;. everything must be configured by manual editing the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc. here is an example of how a 'flash' is played with the module swastdec-mozilla:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash 'can be played inside & kmplayer; it can even be inserted into the special box Embed for YouTube in the playlist XML.</seg>
<seg id="1724">To play the & kmplayer; 'flash' in HTML pages, the & kmplayer must be used as a service provider for the Mime Type application / x-Shockwave flash in setup dialog file assignment of KDE.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The conqueror or & kmplayer; can be used in a consoles application and to search for error messages concerning charging the browser module. if no errors occur, the backend output within & kmplayer; (view, console, or console from the context menu).</seg>
<seg id="1726">So always a given backend for a particular Mime type (of course only if this has been determined), this must be done by manual changing the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc. for example, phonon should play all ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& kmplayer; can play with TV cards, either via MPlayer or XVideo (this requires kxvplayer). before TV can be checked, you need to use the used device and the TV channels. this can be edited manually from the configuration dialog, or the configuration file can be edited manually.</seg>
<seg id="1728">To configure the VDR (video data recorders) Settings in the kmplayer is the dialog in the Settings - &gt; Quelle- &gt; VDR- &gt; XVideo Port. there you should be detected by which one is selected. (e.g., PAL for West Europe), the correct name probably has a DVB-in box.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since the VDR support of kmplayer can only use XVideo (probably this type of playing video devices under Linux is the only one). this is why the videoforlinux extension must be functional for the X server. therefore, this must contain the following function in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config).</seg>
<seg id="1730">Internally displaced SMB for the sources are used for sources different names. at the time of creating this documentation, this dvdnavsource, introdsource, tvector, tvector, tvector, vcdsource and vdrsource. if they are activated, they start playing the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1731">Is there some hints as I can do my CDROM drive when I play of it (not from the VCD: / /)?</seg>
<seg id="1732">Yes, the command hdparm -E 8 / dev / cdrom is as user root according to the integration of the device. making sure / dev / cdrom can be found on the CDROM drive.</seg>

<seg id="1769">Regarding the Edit -toolbar, the three major selection fields should be found in the document. the first selection panel is designed for rapid breakdown of the document in parts, chapters, sections,... The veritable & latex; commands for the subdivision are:</seg>
<seg id="1770">The drop down menu is for example, for example, such as tags, fusions, notes or wise. the possible options are:</seg>
<seg id="1771">Name: this command is a name for a section, a picture or a different element.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Reference: is used for reference to a specified name (selection over a selection field).</seg>
<seg id="1773">When using quotation is displayed a selection list with literary entries. for the editing of & BibTex; files are needed appropriate editors. the author has good experiences with & kbibtex; and & kbib;. the author has good experiences with & kbibtex; and & kbib; - files can also be written in & kile; by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The final selector field with the name GrÃ ¶ e is used for setting the fonts. it can be specified for the main text, the text notes, etc., the following font names are available:</seg>
<seg id="1775">When calling & kile; two selections are available for disposal: 1. the assistant for creating a new document by selecting the document type and stacking settings. 2. the document can be written by reason on hand.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The brackets according to the command\\ 'documents contain the settings for the command. the font is set forth. the font is not set at the beginning, it may also happen in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Once the above source code has been entered, the & latex has to be compiled. the simplest way to this is the use of the menu building or the push of the button.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be saved before compile. & kile; for storing the storage automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1779">In case the compiling of the document fails, should be searched after the errors. when using Quick construction, & eyepiece should be started. if this is not the case, the log should also be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1780">An area (english.environment) is a text which is handled differently than the rest document. for example, a report with the font names should have a different font. the command\\ 'begin {proliferation},\\ Huge and\\' {proliferation}. the command\\ ',\\ Huge and\\' {Field}.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The possible changes will only be careful within the environment (from\\ '=' environment} to\\ '{proliferation}. there are no costs (number) for the possible changes within a environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many opportunities for the possibility of readability and usability of the document. for example, certain fonts, fat pressure, cursions, understractions, etc can be collected. these commands are either by command\\, or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ 'begin {emph}: this command is available for the short pressure and is long as long as available, until it is closed with a\\' {emph} or another environment. a single word in one sentence can be displayed using\\ emph {word}.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ Quote: creates a quote in the document. the quote starts with\\ 'begin {Quote} and ends with\\ end {Quote}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After the background to write the source text with the & latex; pronunciation language is presented, a step-by-step guide for creating a document in & kile;.</seg>
<seg id="1786">As soon as the assistant was entered a bit of text, there should be a few adaptations for the better readability of the document. a quote, a few places in fat and spa, and a poem to apply to see the differences of these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed, an editor-view or Ctrl E may be returned to the editor (in internal viewer). with an external viewer, its window must be closed.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI-file has been created, the document can be printed or converted into a & PostScript; / PDF file is converted. just try and have fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is a bit of file format (engl. D e V ice I nop). these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for the readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of .dvi output like printer, & PostScript; / PDF converter or computer screens.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For printing a & DVI; file the same steps as for the creation of the document is available (see). in the 7th step - by clicking on it, you can print the document using file printing (if the printer is set correctly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The tool bar involves the conversion of DVI; file in other formats. once the DVI; file created from the & latex; source code created, the conversion into any other formats can begin using the knob PFE in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The advance search will encourage the direct jump from the editor to daisy-open position within the DVI; -file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& kile; offers a corresponding setting for all & latex; binaries. for this purpose only modern under settings Kile will have to set up... tools in building.</seg>
<seg id="1794">In order to look for the incident, the cursor must be clicked on one line of the source text, and close on forward. the jump to the corresponding place in DVI; viewer then takes place.</seg>
<seg id="1795">This function in & eyepiece; with one click of the middle mouse button in DVI; document the corresponding & latex; document the corresponding & latex; read & kile; in & eyepiece; in & eyepiece; set up as text editor (settings eyepiece... Editor)</seg>
<seg id="1796">If using Quick & DVI &gt; Use quick, an error can be found. should an error occur, this will be displayed in the log file or in the message window.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The logging file obstruct the error source in the source code. in the editor, the dumb error messages can be seen from the errors. in order to see the error in the log file, you have to click on the error in the log file. click on the error in the log file.</seg>
<seg id="1798">As soon as the button is clicked on the toolbar button, a window appears to select the template for the document. the pre-set values are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">When selecting a blank document, a document may be re-written either by reason or the wizard for fast creating a new document. further information is included in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">HÃ ¢tier users of & latex; use mostly the same introduction to virtually all documents. templates can be created in & kile; created, stored and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, either a existing & tex; - / latex; file can be created or a new file created. & kile; can create a new template by using an existing document and selecting file template from document... create.</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document from a template using file New, some strings are replaced by other data (e.g. name or character encoding). these variables can be set up in settings Kile... Settings General.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating your own template, it is necessary to know which strings from which variables are replaced:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $: this string is replaced by the input in document category. typically, they will be used as follows:\\ 'documents $$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {items}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The simplest way to create a template is the use of the wizard and the use of commands in the editor. once the document has been created in this way, the following steps has been completed:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, you can choose your own template instead of default.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any & latex; -files can be created. a simple way for creating a template should be searched after an online search and the steps described below steps.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& kile; used & Kate; as an internal editor. & Kate; is a Textsditor for programmers with many different types of text files (including & latex; and & BibTex;). many settings for & Kate; can be made directly from & kile.</seg>

<seg id="1812">When drawing the text with penetrating left mouse button, the full text is automatically copied to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="1813">When using the arrow keys with penetrated light, parts of the source code can be selected in the editing window.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& kile; has the ability to search for most types of source texts and emphasise them. for example, the & latex; commands from normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by another color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many assistants can be found. this is an own kind of bookmarks in the text. the menu entries are highlighted in the text. this jump is also highlighted so that they are automatically logged in with the first input of a sign.</seg>
<seg id="1816">The editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program such as & kile; although & Kate; already excellent yields, were added in & kile; important functions for the writing of a & latex; available in & kile; special commands for their selection. under editing options, the following commands are included in the text-code:</seg>

<seg id="1818">Changes the word under the current cursor position. this option also has an extended meaning as this command also has & latex; commands with a track (\\) and an additional star (*) at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">For example a part of the document can then be removed from this first and can be removed by clicking the key Ctrl; K with its own commands to be removed. & Kate; with your own commands you can contain a faster mixer. under editing, include the following commands to include the text:</seg>
<seg id="1820">Removes a complete paragraph. the definition of a paragraph in & kile; is contained in the description to edit EQUIPMENT paragraph.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It has already been clarified that environments play a central role in & latex; therefore, & kile; for further commands under Edit environment for a simple work with & latex;.</seg>

<seg id="1995">& DTEP; s can be created manually (see below), downloaded or automatically created from an existing DTD. see for details on conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1996">This document describes how to create TagXML files, then the file descriptionrc; and tool bars. short, a & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="1997">TagXML files (.tag) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and content of the Featuresdialoges, the & quantitative information; file contains the rules and information of & DTEP; even. toolbars offer a fast insertion of tags in a document without risk of a typewriter.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Tag Folder are nothing known as folders. you only contain the file name & descriptionrc; and the TagXML files. tag folder bear the name of the prescription language and version, so available. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of the TagXML and declared if it is necessary, or not. although not all necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information in working with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes every element in detail. everything about the possibilities and limits is explained in a simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of a TagXML document. it can only occur once in a document. it can contain the definition of many tags, but contains nothing else than just element.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The type of tags is a script function. when using & lt; attr &gt; a argument of the function. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2003">Valid only for the Tagtype class. the name of the basic class for this class. (only family 2)</seg>

<seg id="2011">Requires source = dcop, a sectional type and a methodology name. the arguments to be passed to the method. can be empty or% tagename%, which means the name of the current tags.</seg>
<seg id="2012">A container tag that group the elements of a list together. it can occur only once. it is an element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Sets the position of an attribute within a dialog box. this day can occur for each attribute in one dialog (e.g. once for each & lt; attr &gt; tag). the element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Gives the position and size of a field in dialogue. this day should be available for each field in the dialog (e.g. one for each & lt; attr &gt; and lt; label &gt; Tag). this element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2015">Gives a list of elements that may be stored within the defining tags. this element is an only element type.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Gives a list of elements that end a day. this element is an only element type.</seg>
<seg id="2017">All TagXML files have to start with an & XML;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = 1.0 encoding = 1.0-8? &gt; and must be properly chained and closed.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Spaces influence nothing, but pay attention to & & lt; signs. these should be replaced by & lt; tooltip &gt;, & lt; whatsthis &gt;, and & lt; text &gt; can not be replaced, but some pieces of work would disappear.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To check the TagXML files, the tools dialog is up in & quaplus; -Windows to start and check TagXML. a further dialogue will appear to follow the simple instructions.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This function is currently not available. currently, verification is only available when charging the TagXML files in & quantitative;.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In the following an example for a family 1 day XML file. this file describes the & lt; schema &gt; element from the & W3C; & XML; schema. the filename for this TagXML file should be schema.tag.</seg>

<seg id="2027">"" "the button labeled" "" "Undefined button" "". "with clicking the User button, you can assign a button to the button." "" "the current shortcut can be removed." ""</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. it can be entered into the detailed settings and in execution of the action this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful action type. with the help of this action, external applications (usually scripts, but it is not limited) which can change the document or as input (or parts of the document), which are the quickstart-dialog or the various see in... actions for the (X) HTML-DTD.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First, the name of the script and interpreter must be specified. example: SH / home / myHome / myscript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scriptb variable in command line: $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / scripts in their path: $PATH There are other special variable that can be used in command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we are replaced with the URL of the current document. in case of a local document file is file: / from the document name.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: is replaced with the PID of the current & quantitative; only one instance is running, the text is unique to the PID number. this is useful when DCOP is used to control & quaplus; used by the external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameter for this event, normally the filename of the current document or the path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the included methods, one script can oppose & quaplus; at the default input. in the drop-down input, the default input is to be sent to the default input. options are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected range of document is sent to the script. the% input variable is normally useful with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to the input, the output of the executed application can be redirected. there are two types of output: normal edition, written to the standard output. it can be specified, which is set to the standard edition written by default, by the value the selector issue is set:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the Markup language, there is recommended to divide the tags in logical groups. in the case it is not too many, so you can create a tool bar with the name of the market.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a tool bar is added, you must add and configure actions. select actions set.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are quite self-explanatory. press the new action button at the bottom end of the window starts editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill out all the necessary fields and add the tag to the matching toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete all and if the day attributes has and you are planning its use, activate dialog "edit" when available to make a input when using the action is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Stop! is this a ugly symbol. who should remember the action in connection with this symbol? do we replace it before we have difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that the action represents better, we will use & kiconedit; choose from & kmenu;, graphics further programs (or where else it is located in your distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; used by default 32x32 pixels, but we need 22x22. to change this, choose the size of others.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created symbol is not only helps you to remember what the action does, but also all other users of the & DTEP.</seg>
<seg id="2047">"" "" "" "regarding that the day of start is, I decided to create a startingbutton as a symbol. by using green (green it is usually interpreted as a symbol), or at least, a message to the user is signalized," "" "a message to the user is a & lt; start to insert the tag in the current document." ""</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol it has to be linked to the action. this is done through the menu with Settings... (in & quaplus;) and selection of the desired action. in addition to the text box is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder where the stored symbol is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the button and continue with other tags, so there are or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some usual & quantiquus; functions to toolbar, or it should set them to better overview through some separations in several groups. make sure to set the toolbar dialog via Settings tool bar. make sure the toolbar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I want to select the separator (all left above) for my toolbar. following the selection of the element that is to be added to toolbar, press the arrow keys to the right. this adds the toolbar element.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I want a quick way to access the konqueror preview. I'll select it and add to toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note, as the separner support the grouping. someone who doesn't know my toolbar could believe that the & Conqueror; button is the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new tool bar must be tested by using all symbols, to ensure everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">If new XML does not exist, it will be created in the right folder, but your toolbar (s) should be stored in the right folder. please adjust your tool bar, so that your tool bar will be loaded (s) if a file is opened from the respective type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most important extension of & quaplus; for the normal user is the opportunity to add documentation for scripting language or the formatting language that you like to like. therefore, this chapter describes how I create a & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before you start your own documentation, you could check at & quantitative, whether somebody has done it for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to create an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; then you need to create the docrc file. then we will need to leave the docrc file. we will leave the second part we will deal here.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE configuration file [Tree] Doc dir = pfone, relative to this file, for example php42 / # Elements in the main index Top Element, e.g. php42, # Sec2.3, # Sec2.3, # Sec2.3, # Sec2.3, # Sec2.3, # Sec2.3, # Sechtml-1 = Conference 2 html-1 = tag2.html-3 = tag3.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The tree tree defines the visible aspect of documentation in the Documentation tree. for example, see in the & PHP; documentation is something:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config File [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level Elements Top Element = PHP 4.2 Run = Table of Contents, # Getting started, # Language Reference Table of Contents = Basic syntax,... Basic syntax = language.basic-synsyntax. html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before getting started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is a tree in tree with its own content. there is no known limit for chess problems (except through reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the table of contents is referenced directly to a file (and has to be displayed at the top end of the tree view & mdash; file is displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces are affecting nothing, but pay attention & & lt; signs. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantiaplus; resources are replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The synocrc file is the area of the docrc file, which is to be displayed in context of context-sensitive help. by checking the function called and pressing Ctrl; H for context-help the documentation would be shown directly. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (Context List) and the file binding lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of separated context elements that should be available (for & PHP;, these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can save your file docrc simply save it to $HOME / .kde / share / doc / Quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / doc / Quanta / doc for local and global use. then create a file in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that these good and worth are shared, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. which documentation have been used to the & quantum leus; -Repository for use by the & quantum leus; -community. they will not be rich, but proud to have been working on the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quaplus; you are not alone. it is possible to share the disclosing resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent by e-mail to friends, partners or otherwise send an email, such as DTD DTD package (DTEP) with email, toolbar toolbar with email, in the context menu files and folders in templates and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded to our main archive, where all the other & quaplus; -Users are being checked and only available when our team needs them as a correct and usable for the publication. for example, we recommend a GPG / PGP key. thus, the source of resources is ensured, both for our team and for later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading, you are asked to ask for their private GPG key (the Passphrase will not be stored), or in the case that you have multiple keys, you may need to select an input field (URL preview can be empty) and with clicking OK the uploading will be launched.</seg>
<seg id="2074">The uploading can be uploading from the DTD DTD-package (DTEP), toolbars and folders in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, still before installation, examines & quantitative. in case of problems, it happens and then it can be canceled. if the integrity is given and the resource is signed, a notification will appear with the specification of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work in XML languages, which is currently not able to work by & quaplus; however, it can be time consuming, because hundreds of day files can be necessary in the XML format. there is easier way to convert DTD automatically into a DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD menu and converging of a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD-description, which should be used. afterwards, the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target image: the newly created & DTEP; is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! DOCTYPE Definitions: the string that should appear in! DOCTYPE tag, such as HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / HTML4 / loose.dtd should appear</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine adjustment of DTEP after conversion: if enabled, & quantum lus; after converting the & descriptionrc; editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this option.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantum aplus; there are some key concepts. to understand these and full use of & quaplus; first, you have to identify with these fundamental concepts, so this chapter is trying to close them with these basic concepts, without their understanding & quantitative information; little benefit.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quaplus; the working area is divided into three areas: global, locally and projection. this distinction concerns a range of components in & quantitative.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for each, the & quaplus; uses, available. from toolbars, everything is labeled, in the shared folder structure of & quaplus; this allows the group of administrators to secure different toolbars, actions and samples in the global tree, which will then be available in a multi-user environment at the system.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local Elements represent a personal collection of web development agent for a single user. local elements are stored in the user directory so they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are only available within a particular project. this can be everything from & CSS; all elements are specially designed for files of a particular project. simply, this is the most limited size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, which is the common usage of special tools and patterns of all employees inside the project emoglides.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quaplus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the Editorwindow, the construction manager, the boxes with info and toolbars. please beat in, and for further information about these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click on the tab with the right mouse button to obtain a context menu with the current document necessary, reloading, delete or uploading the document, jump to a bookmarks or execution of CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right section in the Editorsection leads to another context menu concerning the integrated document content, such as basic progress steps (cut / copy / paste), editing the file under the mouse cursor, or opening the file, if the string is called a file under the mouse pointer.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top end of the Editorfensters the tool bar is present. currently, & quantum; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional is shown as standard, for which a set of tool bar is shown. in the course of further development of & quantitative, toolbars will be adapted to new functions and thus allied user needs.</seg>
<seg id="2090">"" "the use of toolbars is really easy. if they want to insert a single day, e.g. & lt; in its document, then click on the" "" "tag" "" "button, then you can insert the data for this just one day (like anchor), you can fill in a dialog different fields." ""</seg>
<seg id="2091">The constructions (QIT;) allows to navigate in the information about & quaplus; to navigate, to open and to go through. in the representation of boxes, project, pattern templates, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool which provides & quantize; this view displays all files in the project and allows the manage of files in the project with right mouse click. actions such as add, removing, upload or delete the files from the storage medium can be performed with then displayed context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another way of & quaplus; is the use of templates. almost anything can be a template: images, program parts, a whole website & etc; There are all options open.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories, depending on which it is used. the category depends on & quaplus; the area is always available, local templates only for the corresponding users and templates in projects are available only in the project. more templates can be found in this project.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you will find information about the available scripting languages. the concept of integration in global, local and project works too. by clicking with the left mouse button, you can download the information available to a script. via the right mouse button, further functions are available, such as the script to start, edit or send an email.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With this view one shows the internal structure of the active document. by clicking a element, the cursor is set to the position of the element. by right clicking an element you will open a list of commands in terms of navigation and refreshment of the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears among the other buildings. with it, manfast attributes and namespaces change. the content of all available attributes can be changed to the contents of all available attributes.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the full documentation to find web technology for your development. you can download documentation for & quaplus; from the quantum doc, you can create your own documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project can be edited. edited and considered.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quaplus; two tabs at the bottom end of the window can be reached via the useful information window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This tab displays information on each script in a quantum running script. for example, the DTD used the current document and all changes to DTD are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This tab displays all error in the markup of the current document. & quantitative, scripts that are executed, give all error messages (such as there is) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantum leus; toolbars are extensive and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they receive the respective command. the chocolate bars of the tool bar is the possibility of defining their own orders as symbols in & quantitative.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quaplus; is the ability to send a tool bar with e-mail. & quantum-mail; sends the tool bar as a compressed Tar archive via & Kmail; if they charge a tool bar in an email, they can assure them and load them!</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to adjust the place of & quaplus; -files on your system. for this, autoconf has a number of options to get to the configure script. to get a complete list of options, type. / configure --help. the options are easy to understand and not executed here.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems with starting & quaplus; you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 bin folder. also, you should make sure that no older version of & kde; 3 in PATH is in front of her bin folder. the same applies to & Qt;.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantitative; is a web development tool for the KDE surface. & quantum lus; was optimized for a fast web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">While making effort to create the best & HTML editor, the developers of & quaplus began to work with an obvious idea: what would be if & quaplus; an independent, expandable Markup language editor? well, this would make him an absolutely greatest Web development tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer limited to pure & HTML; limited, is & quantitative: now already found on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. if you can define it in & XML; then it should be quantiaplus; it should be the appropriate & IDE.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Well, to the above mentioned requirement needs to be stated that & quantum dlus; as product based on the outstanding efforts of the whole & kkers; follow, in good use of free software, the idea of why developer, is not only possible, but it allows users and developers, & quaplus; so to expand how they need it for their needs.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quaplus; allows web development to boost the use of an intuitive and powerful multi-document surface (MDI;). this can extend the automation nearly every task. by means of self-knitted actions, scripts and toolbars, you can expand & quantize. (read more about it in.)</seg>
<seg id="2111">& Quanta; Plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it has been designed for fast web development and was quickly developed into a sophisticated editor with many powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& Quanta; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of & Quanta; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>

<seg id="2115">A quick access list of files you have opened. this list changes every time if you open a file, which is not located on it, the oldest entry is taken out.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use. if you want to store in the section through templates. if you try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project device folder, only one error is reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">To insert from the clipboard there are special characters to & HTML; description, so that it is displayed correctly and not be understood by the browser as formatting.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Converts the text from clipboard in & URL, indicating that the correct way to inserting special characters and spaces in & URL; s are primarily used for inserting & URL; s into the anchor per day.</seg>

<seg id="2123">- and Switching on the problem reporters at the lower edge of & quantum leus; main window. the problem reporter is activated as soon as you change to the structural tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Displays the symbol column left from the main window. this column allows you to set bookmarks with a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2125">If the bookmarks are available in the current file, they will appear in the menu with entries previous or next, depending on the cursors position in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other open documents appear in the menu grouped according to the filename of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens an existing project from the hard disk. & quaplus; projects are stored with the extension .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog to add files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied to the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searches the project directory after new files that could be there. this allows to copy graphic files to your project folders or a sub-folder and then add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Loads the files in your project to the server high. the list of available transport methods depends on your Version of & kde; from and if you have downloaded additional inputs / output modules (Kio Slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings like & quaplus; the project administrates. in chapter & quantum-projects you will find details of the details.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Loads a project tool bar. these are stored in the project You / Toolbars and are only in this menu if you have assigned it to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to save your toolbars. allows you to select the tool bar type: local or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Open a dialog to add a new toolbar. this creates only the name. actions need to be added using settings. toolbars are stored on toolbars and you will be asked when you want to store the toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Removes a toolbar from the field. deletes it not from the hard disk. if you haven't saved the tool bar, you will be asked if you want to do this.</seg>
<seg id="2136">This allows you to send your own toolbar to someone (maybe to the & quantum hus; - team, that the tool bar is present in the next publication). the menu item opens a new email message with the tool bar as an appendix.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Allows uploading of toolbars to the main server, where anyone else can access it. see in.</seg>

<seg id="2140">This menu contains a list of tags available in the currently loaded tool bar. if the Standard (HTML;) tool bar is loaded, there is a sub-menu standard that contains the list of tags / promotions on this toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current tag dialog, if there is one. this entry is always present in the menu Tags, followed by & DTD; -specific submenu.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Activated or disabled the intelligent insertion of tags. currently, this only works with (X) HTML-DTDs. it's currently not working with (X) HTML-DTDs. it's refusing to add tool bar if this tag does not contradict the rules this day.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the plug-ins menu, the available plug-ins are listed among the listed menu options. click on. click the activated plug-ins disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Select the syntax highlighting mode for the current file. the list of available modulating schemata depends on derkate; -Version.</seg>

<seg id="2154">& quantitative product; is a high quality product that is freely available and free licensed, but as with any open source project, developers can always use help. if they want to support & quantum; development in financial shape, find the way here.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should be completed at the top of the project, for example, after completing the project name, complete directory structure for the rest of the project. all these paths and author information fields can be changed later with Shift; F7 project project properties.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here's the name for the project, for example foo. when entering from Name, file will be automatically filled.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantum leus; project file. by default it has the name of the project in lowercase and without spaces with the extension webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you can access the server address of the machine on which one wants to access the local data. either a name (hostname.exempl.de) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If you leave this field empty, the default log settings are used. depending on the remote computer setting, an adaptation could be needed.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder where the templates are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default templates. if a common collection of files used for various projects, this folder should be adjusted instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder where the tool bar is stored for the project. it is a relative path to the Project and by default Toolbars. if a common collection of files used for various projects, this folder should be adjusted instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows to add files from the local file system to the project. multiple files or whole folder can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you want to download and modify the static web content. for serversive scripts (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc;) you have to proceed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">If files are located somewhere in the main folder of the project, if a project is re-started, it will not be started.</seg>
<seg id="2165">With this option, all files and folders will be displayed inside the main folder and you can make a precise selection according to good.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in the main folder. you can select the desired files by hook, or by removing the skins, clips from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings, which simplify your work. these settings can be upload in menu with Project Properties in the menu area Properties or with the Shift Shift; F7.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in. additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of file names (placeholder are possible) which will be ignored for project-related operations like Project Folders.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Additional option to be listed above, even files that are listed in .cvsignor are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view, which is loaded when opening the project, can be read more about projections.</seg>
<seg id="2172">This allows to select the desired debugger. currently, only Gubed is supported. more information about Gubed can be found in. the debugger plugin can be adjusted with the Options button. in this case, the debugger can be described.</seg>
<seg id="2173">In the subwindow profiles, high load profiles (see in) can be specified, as well as the display for the contents of the server for each profile by drawing an own tree view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the subwindow team configuration, project members can be added, edited or deleted as well as a mailing list. see the details below.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the subwindow configuration, you can turn event actions and add these actions, change or delete these actions. events are executed if there is a certain event, such as the sighting of a file. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default, & quaplus opens; the last project that was open. this behavior can currently not be influenced.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open another project, select Project Open... from the Project Project or the Symbol Project open from toolbar. the Project Open Project will be displayed and allows selecting a project. projects have .webprj as extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">If & quaplus; closed, the project file will be stored automatically. you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving if & quaplus; changed files. the same happens when you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project manview gives free access to the files in the project. the files can be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folder can also behave, however, the entries are opening and opening with... in the right mouse button to open the context menu:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Various profiles can be selected here. the profile contains information on the location of the highly scalable files.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows removing the current profile. if only a profile is present, the button appears to prevent removing.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password is kept in the kernel and is forgotten when frequent uploading of files is needed and the rather unreliable password on the disk can not be found in question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transfer or leave the dialog, if you change your mind before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quaplus; many high load profiles can be created and the project (or parts of the project) can be uploaded to different servers. when editing or creating a profile, this dialog is displayed:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the server name server to be copied to the files. either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for uploading. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed Kio Slaves. at least you should choose from & ftp;, file (locally) and NFS.</seg>
<seg id="2188">Port for transfer. normally this does not have to be changed, except the network administrator runs a service not on the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your anxiety shaft, this is either a time-saving function or a danger. use it according to your discretion. the password will be stored on the disk, so it can't be easily read, but everyone with programming knowledge can easily be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is just a set of files and tool bars. it can be loaded in a project many views, i.e. by simply Taube the view, various files and toolbars can be loaded and replace the current open files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be stored in the menu or the project toolbar, accessible via Settings tool bar toolbar, opened or deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quaplus; in which one has most to do. this helps not only increase productivity but also allows the adaptation of & quantitative; to its own working mode.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As already mentioned above are toolbars in & quaplus; best on toolbars menu bar. use and add materials. the addition of toolbars can be distinguished below in the addition of toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Toolbars and symbols can be set on either by context menu (right-click on the toolbar, you can set other actions such as tool bar, toolbar or toolbars, which can be specified in the dialog where indicated, which actions on this or other tool bars are to be visible.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action (symbol) on a toolbar, the entries will be removed and action worked, which are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">Toolbars and the actions on them can set up menu options in the menu with Settings... and set Settings.. set.</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are in fundamental document skeletons, code schnitzel and files to connect. & quaplus; it is basically used as a usual file system with extended organization and interfaces. you can copy, move or delete each on the system existing directory into the predisposes. templates have in & quaplus; in about the restrictions you refer to the file system.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some templates with & quaplus; provided templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions set before using exactly.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary is all that is not purer text, so images, & PDF; s, Flash files & etc; binary. binary templates are usually included in documents using shortcuts (e.g. pictures with IMG src = / src / url). some examples are found in the predisposes of global templates. more information about templates is available.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be created by any text document. on basis of these templates, new documents can be created. usually, special documents can be created. usually, you will find a simple framework for the purpose and organising work in appropriate manner to be efficient. some examples may be found under global templates. see for more information about the templates tree.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This kind of templates is useful, if not a new document is to be inserted once again on a template, but the same text area again to the documents. you can find it all about a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl. see some examples in the store space under global templates. see for more information about the templates tree.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates for whole sites serve as templates. they are a collection of different documents which can be organized in a folder structure. there are currently no examples in & quantitative.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Create a document structure according to will (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;.) and select File As template save As local template.</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once that is done, you notice that (even if it was saved as a project template), the template is not visible in the project tree. look at the project tree under projections.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click on File As a template store selecting a local / project template. alternatively, the selection can be easily drawn with pulling and placing on the tree view templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: the file is only enough to copy the file. all file management functions can be used, such as pulling and insertion or insertion over the file tree of Konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can select a folder on the file tree or in the project files tree view, select a name for the template and secure it. by default, it is stored in the project folder, but of course it can be stored as local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates allow a very target-oriented vortex. you can create headlines and footer or dynamically with & PHP; create, paste or link them with them. additionally, you can keep some things using templates in projects very deep in the eye.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the subwindow is based upon the files stored in $KDEDIR / share / apps, and $HOME / .kde / share / templates / Quanta / templates / Quanta / templates. each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers, as above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To specify the behavior of a folder, in the pre-press overview with the right mouse button, click the folder and select in the context menu properties. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A drop down selector with the three previously described types; files, text or templates. this selection is blindfolded as soon as mental attributes are verted.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and adapts everything except the regular folder. if a regular folder would be set out in this path, it would explicitly appear to be explicitly enabled. in the case of a normal folder, the blah would appear with something like text module. if nothing appears, it is likely to appear in a regular folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows forwarded or displayed text for templates in this folder. this could be a general header or footer for all templates for a particular project and enabled to copy the contents into a folder with special header lines / footer to equip an entire presentation with the appropriate head lines / footer.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, you have a context menu (pointing out, right mouse button) via a complete command collection for adding files or copy and paste from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quaplus; offers two modes: VPL; editor and VPL; & source text editor that is accessed via the menu view. the first mode is replacing the source code in two parts: source code editor and VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: he invites you to edit a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; then you can edit and turn back to the source code editor in which the changes made in the VPL; editor are visible in the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; editor on a document that contains the VPL; source code. it is not possible to edit this directly to the VPL; editor. it is not possible to edit this directly to the VPL; editor is still necessary to change this code. there are no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works just like the first one, except that at the same time, changes both in the source code editor and in the VPL; editor is inactive, and the cursor is activated in the source text editor and in the VPL; this mode is already active, transmitting the active cursor from a window to others, where the position is maintained in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronisation distance between the VPL; editor and the source code editor is set to set up over Settings Quanta. in addition, you can choose between synchronization according to one click or automatically. in principle, the recommendation can be set automatically after one click or automatically. in principle, the recommendation is required for fast calculator and a big scoop for slow motion.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools for the same. so why & kdiff3;? let me explain why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated, because one of the workers had made many changes and at the same time had changed the retrofit. another programmer had changed much text in the same file. the result was numerous conflicts in merge.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program that was used by me did not show me the changed lines, but I could not see what exactly changed within these lines. and there was no evidence of the positions where the result of these changes had been a little nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">This was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could display differences within one line and changes to white characters. later, lots of other useful functions have been added later.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to compare text quickly, simply copy it into the clipboard and add it in one of the comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the comparing and merge of folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost into a full file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-way clash result is fully supported. this is useful when two persons operate independently of each other on a piece of code and make changes. in this editor, you can even edit the result. in this editor, you can even process the result directly. in this editor, you can even process the result directly with the result:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; helps you also with the comparison and merge complete file. this screen picture shows & kdiff3; in folder merge:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; displays the exact differences and refer to the possibilities of today's paint monitors. if you need to check code, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white signs and tabs are visible. when the lines differ only in a certain number of white characters, it can be seen at a glance at the abstract section on the left side. (no more trouble if no one changes immigration.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">When a file is the same, and the others differ in one line, then the color indicate which file is different. red color means that both files differ.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files are the same name, but in different folders, you can ease the typing work by writing only the filename of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Kdiff3 Folder 1 folder 2-o target folders Kdiff3 Folder 1 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder folders</seg>
<seg id="2294">Open dialogue offers manual typing of filenames, selecting a recently opened file from the drop-down list. open your selection and displays them next time; if you leave the entry for C empty, the analysis of the differences will be performed with two files.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Via the button folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the comparison or merge of folders will be selected, for B and C, then a folder, then use & kdiff3; the filename from A in the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">If merge is crossed, the input field will be active for the target and is not necessarily required to specify an output file immediately. you can do this step later when saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The setup button opens a dialog with Settings. you can set options before starting with the same / merge.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you do not want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text box into the active comparison window. when compared, you don't need to select files from clipboard to the active comparison window. in opening dialogue, you will need to close the dialog with the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also drag and put off: simply drag a file from one file manager or selected text from one editor and drop it over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">What idea is behind it? sometimes, a file contains several similar functions. if you'd like to find out how much these features, it would be a relatively big effort. you would have to upload two corresponding files, they should be able to copy them in & kdiff3; now you can copy the relevant sections, insert and then compare.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: you can get nothing out of & kdiff3; pull out. only the drop of text into a comparison window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the drag and tear of text into another program as slicing and insertion (instead of copying and paste). in such a case your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">In the upper part of each text window, the info line contains the characters A, B or C, the file name and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that window C is optional.) Each file has a different color. (if the path is too long, let the mouse take a while above the line. then a small relief window will display the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three main sources are the letters A, B and C assigned. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these settings can be changed via the Settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">When a difference is detected, the color is different. if both files differ, the default color is different. (colour for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is especially useful when you see three files. that's in the next section (merge) well.</seg>
<seg id="2306">Left next to the text is the congestion column. when differences are found, the column displays the corresponding color. if there are differences in white characters, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (at C / C + + for example, white characters are only relevant in strings and comments, relevant for the preprocessor and in few, rare cases relevant.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line, which separates the summaries from the text, is interrupted on places where the respective source file does not have lines. if the line file is activated, the line is scored.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (among the comparison list) also has a info line with the inscription release:, the file name, and [changes] when you have processed the result. usually it contains text, but often it contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are dissolved, saving is disabled!!! (use the buttons to find next dissolved / unresolved conflict to find remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparators are used, each difference should also be solved to manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows a group will be marked in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed. (this group will also be highlighted in the current group.) This group will be highlighted in the current group. it will be highlighted with the color background color for current areas and on the left appears a black beam.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes there is no more line left through automatic clash or by manual editing. this text is displayed in these lines. this text is only a place for the case that you might change your mind and maybe another source file. this text appears neither in the final saved file, nor in a marking that you might copy and insert somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; arranging together; however, appears in the clipboard if you copy the text from the result window. carefully proceed with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: if selecting the sources ignore the options, ignore or ignore C / C + + comments, changes in numbers or comments are also treated as white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigate mainly with the images and the mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you're in one of the windows, you can use the arrow keys on the left, right, late, Ctrl-beginning and Ctrl-end, you can also click on the navigation panel next to the vertical frame rate.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the eye window you can also use the other keys to edit. using the Add-button, you can switch between plug-in and writable mode. (default is the plug-in mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the summarizing columns will synchronizes the view of all windows to the beginning of the respective group (as already described in the section and the editable output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The tool bar contains seven buttons to navigation with which you can jump to the current / last difference (Ctrl-Down / Ctrl-Up), to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-Down / Ctrl-Down) or to the next / previous conflict, even after manual destructions. hence, between dissolved and unresolved conflicts can be distinguished.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the markings into the clipboard, you need to copy the Copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl). however, it is possible to automatically copy the clipboard and manually copy the clipboard. be careful with this option, as you accidentally overwrite the content of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Cashenings are stored according to the underlying operating system. Unix flavors use a line-in line\, and Win32-based systems do not use Wagenrollback\\ r\. Kdiff3 doesn't recharge the lines of cedar files, therefore you should use & kdiff3; nor do not use binary files.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and list of the last used files will be stored automatically and restored during the next start. (menu adjustment &gt; Kdiff3)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Select a typeface with fixed width. (on some systems, the dialog box provides fonts with variable width to choose you should not use them.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you activate this option, differences in italics are displayed. if the selected font is not supported, nothing happens.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors could not be available in its pure form but would be displayed. on these systems the button settings will automatically display an odd color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">When this option is enabled, pressing the button key will be inserted into the appropriate number of spaces. otherwise, a tabulator characters will be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">When you press input or return, the return on the previous line will automatically be used for the next row.</seg>
<seg id="2327">If this option is enabled, each selection will automatically be copied to clipboard. manually copy the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which Zeilenende type you prefer to store. the default value is the general selection on the operating system used.</seg>
<seg id="2329">When comparing files attempts & kdiff3; first, all are identical to the source files. only during this first step, white characters can be ignored. the second step is not ignored. in this step, white signs are not ignored. even when merge, white characters are not ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) save a wagon-run '\' at the end of one line, but other again store only a line slot '\'. if this option is enabled, however, files with different sizes are visible, but as a white character can be disabled. during the result, this option has to be disabled. in default, this option is disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In default, this option is disabled. in the first part of the analysis, numbers and associated characters ('0' - '9', '-') are ignored. in the result the differences are displayed, but they are treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2332">In default, this option is disabled. changes in comments are treated as changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intensely search for even smaller differences. the option is activated in default. it is effective in complicated and large files, but slowly with very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In the automatic transmission mode, this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed, before the next unresolved conflict continues.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Automatic all conflicts in white characters dissolves the selected file as source. (preset is manual selection.) It is useful if you need to use the automatic selection in many files, then use the automatic selection of conflicts in numbers or comments if the options ignore or ignore the options or ignore C / C + + comments.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are discussed in the chapter to scan folders and executing a merger. look for details below documentation for directory comparison and merge.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is saved and already an older version exists, then the original version is the suffix .original file. if there is already such backup file with the suffix .file exists, it will be deleted without further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Fits the language of the user interface. this option does not concern the current running program. you need to stop and reboot, so that the change is active. (this option is not available in the KDE version of & kdiff3; it is not available because the language will be globally controlled via the control centre.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following code settings can be set separately for each entry. if you activate this option, the top setting is used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">Over the selection fields for coding, a brief indication of what the local coding is. (this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file code encoding for source files. this influences such as special characters and interpret. as the coding for each file is individually adjustable, even files with different coding can be compared and merged.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have edited a file, you can specify which coding is to be used for saving.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define pre-processing commands, you may not work with your code c. (for example, if your files can work 16-bit Unicode, but the pre-processing command can only handle 8-bit ASCII.) With this option you can set the coding of output commands.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Turn off this off to suppress any changes in white characters in text or review. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options are ignore or ignore C / C + + comments.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available when you see three files. in normal mode, you may see only the differences between two of three files. according to selection from A & lt; B, A & B; -gt; C or B & lt; -gt; C is displayed in addition to the normal still another second column column with the information required.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you want to use the available space on the screen for long lines. simply finish the less important window. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">Arrange the comparison window by side by side or overlap. this can also be useful for displaying long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you will consider the differences and then decide to merge the files. if you're using only two files. one simple click starts to merge operation and use the filename of the last source file as the default name for the output file. (if this function is used to start merge again, then the name of the last used output file will be maintained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file it will first pass this external command. in & kdiff3; then the output of the command is visible, and not the file itself. you can use your own preprocessor. you can use this function for example to remove interfere parts or to correct the input.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file, it will first be handed over to this external command (see above), then the output command is used only when the output command is used. you can write your own preprocessor. each input line must have an associated issue line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind it is to enable the user more flexibility when setting the diff results. however, an external program is needed, and most users don't want to program it yourself. the good news is, however, that in most cases it suffice or perl perfectly sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">If you use this pre-processing command for Zeilenaborted to input the input in uppercase letters: SED's /\\ U\\ 1 / 'This. * is an ergent expression of on any string.\\ 1 in the tool string refers to the found text in the first brackets. the\\ U converts the found text in uppercase letters.</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems use some key words to automatically add generated characters (info: / cvs / keyword\\ _ BAR _ file\\ _ BAR _ file\\ _ BAR _ file\\ _ BAR _ file\\ _ BAR _ file\\ _ BAR _ file\\ _ BAR _ file\\ _ BAR _ file\\ _ BAR _ file\\ _ BAR _ file\\ _ BAR _ file\\ _ BAR _ file\\ _ BAR _ file\\ _ BAR _ file\\ _ BAR _ file\\ _ BAR _ file\\ _ BAR _ file\\ _ BAR _ file\\ _ BAR _ file\\ _ BAR _ file\\ _ BAR _ file\\ _ BAR _ file\\ _ BAR _ file\\ _ BAR _ file\\ _ BAR _ file\\ _ BAR _ file\\ _ BAR _ file\\ _ BAR _ file\\ _ BAR _ file\\ _ BAR _ file\\ _ BAR _ file\\ _ BAR _ file\\ _ BAR _ file\\ _ BAR _ file\\ _ BAR _ file\\ _ BAR _ file\\ _ BAR _ file\\ _ BAR _ file\\ _ BAR _ file\\ _ BAR _ file\\ _ BAR _ file\\ _ BAR _ file\\ _ BAR _ file\\ _ BAR _ file\\ _ BAR _ file\\ _ BAR _ file\\ _ BAR _ file\\ _ BAR _ file\\ _ BAR _ file\\ _ BAR _ file\\ _ BAR _ file\\ _ BAR _ file\\ _ BAR _ file\\ _ BAR _ file\\ _ BAR _ file\\ _ BAR _ file\\ _ BAR _ file\\ _ BAR _ file\\ _ BAR _ file\\ _ BAR _ file\\ _ BAR _ file\\ _ BAR _ file\\ _ BAR _ file\\ _ BAR _ file\\ _ BAR _ file\\ _ BAR _ file\\ _ BAR _ file\\ _ BAR _ file\\ _ BAR _ file\\ _ BAR _ file\\ _ BAR _ file\\ _ BAR _ file\\ _ BAR _ file\\ _ BAR _ file\\ _ BAR _ file\\ _ BAR _ file\\ _ BAR _ file\\ _ BAR _ file\\ _ BAR _ file\\ _ BAR _ file\\ _ BAR _ file\\ _ BAR _ file\\ _ BAR _ file\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you experiment with sed, you may start to understand it and maybe like this regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs supporting very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">The ignoring of numbers is actually a built-in function in Kdiff3. but it is good as an example of a further pre-processing command for cilenable. sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Every letter between' ['and'] 'is a match, so any hits will be replaced by nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform multiple requirements at once. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the compositions. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of sed you can also use something different such as perl. perl -e -e'S / REGEXP / replacement / switch 'However, perl needs some details different. where sed\\ (and\\) needs perl only (and) without the previous'\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal processor be maintained for viewing and merge. further operations change only the data that the Zeilenaborted algorythm sees.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases when you use a normal processor processor, the line-in preprocessor is the output of the normal preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The pre-processor commands are very useful, but as with any function, the text changes or differences, you can't notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often, programmers need to edit many files. for this reason, you can compare and merge with & kdiff3; complete folder recursively and result.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes a suggestion for each object; you can adjust the proposal before starting,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate the merge and simulate the simulated changes without really performing it,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... selected actions either with all (F7 key) or only with the selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to the comparing and merge of individual files. you just have to specify a folder on the command line or in the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">If three folders will be merged, then folder 1 is used as base. if no destination folder is specified, & kdiff3; folder 3 as target folders.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders will not start the merge. to start merge, you must select the corresponding menu entry or press the F7 key. (further details follow.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">During reading the folder, you will inform a little news window about the current progress. if you disrupture the file, only the files are listed until then.</seg>
<seg id="2369">If the folder is complete, displays & kdiff3; a window window with the results on the left,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and folder that has been found during the scan, is shown here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is usually folded together. you can fold a folder by clicking on the + / - click on the property or by clicking the arrow keys for left / right. the directory menu has two functions. fold in the folder and fold all subdirectories with which you can open all the folders.</seg>
<seg id="2372">If you double click on a file, the file is launched and a comparison window appears.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The icon in column name reflects the file type in the first folder (A) again. these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in other folders, it is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detail pane to the selected object. in such a case, the plug-in action cannot be chosen automatically. if the merge is started, you will be informed about problems of this type.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As shown in the above picture, in the columns A / B / C the colors are red, green, yellow and black.</seg>
<seg id="2376">However, with identical entries the colour is also identical, even if the age of the entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered to be the same as their overall content is identical. then, file the same color. in case of folders, the age is insignificant for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea of this color scheme is based on dirdiff. colours reflect the colors of a sheet, which is only green, then yellow becomes yellow and later when it is old, red becomes.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical but not B: copying B (or if B does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical but not C: copy of C (or if C does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical but not A: copy of A (or if A does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C not have the same file type (e.g. when A a file and B is a file): error: contradictory file types. as long as such faultless objects exist, the merge cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B do not have the same data type (e.g. when A a file and B is a file): error: contradictory file types. as long as such faultless objects exist, the merge cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The mode for synchronizing is active, if only two folders and no explicit target folder were specified. then select & kdiff3; the required action, so that both folders are identical. if for an entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist but not identical: to result together and save the result in both folders. (the user looks as the visible filename for output file only B; directly after arranging it & kdiff3; B by A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">If two folders can be merged and select the new file instead of merge (insecure), then the date of files and suggests the newer file. if the files are different, but the date is identical. if the files are different, but the date is identical.. Solange cannot be removed, the merge may not be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">During the merge, a file will be processed after the others. status column shows far, and correspondingly other messages, if something unexpected, you should make a last review and see if the status is all right.</seg>
<seg id="2388">When the alignment dialog is selected, KDiff3 is selected further columns. these contain the number of unsolved, dissolved, non-white and white conflicts. (the column for dissolved conflicts is only displayed when three folders compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either lead the selected entry (file or odds), or all entries at one time. if you have selected all together-feeding actions (even in all subfolders), you can start the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you do not have a destination folder, then in the three-file merge mode C is used as the target for selecting the two-file merge, A and / or B is used as target.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have chosen a destination folder, please check if all entries are to be displayed in the folder structure. there are some options to be skipped in the folder structure. check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To bring all the entries, select directory to merge / continue in the directory menu or press F7 (the key symbol). to execute just the current record: select action of the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If any conflicting file types still exist still invalid merge actions, a message appears on the defective elements. you can then select a valid action.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you merge all entries, a dialog window appears with the options flow, embarking and interrupt.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Please tify if you want to see what would happen without the really changes. you will then receive a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then performs certain actions with all entries. if a manual procedure is required (merge a single file), then a merge window will open (note the screen picture).</seg>
<seg id="2397">If you're done with a file, select again directory entry / continue, or press F7. if you haven't saved, a corresponding dialog appears. then, & kdiff3, his work will continue with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If & kdiff3; on a mistake, a message appears and detailed status information. at the end of the list, you will see some error messages that will help you try to skip the cause of the problem. if you proceed to retrieve the cause of the problem or to solve the problem of the problem, before you proceed with the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries were individually merged, remembers & kdiff3; these entries (in the current session) and overrun them together. even if the merge operation was performed or not saved, these entries are considered to be performed. only if you change the merge action, these entries will be merged again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & kdiff3; (menu Settings - &gt; KDiff3 set up...) now has a section called folder merge with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that fit the specified patterns will be displayed in the element tree. separate the pattern with a semicolon;. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). the default is *. folders do not have to match this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders which correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be set more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. default is * .original; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders which correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be set more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. default is * .original; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignored files that would also be ignored by CVS. the big advantage is that this folder can be set specifically with a .cvsignal file. (look at info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file systems, files have a default attribute. in other file systems, a previous point is marked as hidden. this option lets you decide whether these files are displayed in the element tree or not. this option is turned on in default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">With links to files: when the option is disabled, symbolic links are compared. if the option is enabled, the files are compared to which the links are disabled. this is disabled by default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">With links to folders: when the option is turned off, links like normal folder will be checked and recursively searches. (note that the links will lead to a loop, and & kdiff3; crashes.) This option is disabled by default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">A complete analysis of each file carries out and shows the statistics of statistics. (the number of dissolved, un- white and white conflicts.) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and significantly slowed if they contain no text. (enter an appropriate anti-pattern).</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare great folders through a slow network, it may vary faster, only the change date and file size. however, it costs a certain level of safety. please check with caution. this option is checked in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to a change date. there is no real comparison. the files are considered to be identical, if it is equally important when copying the Change date. please check with caution. this option is checked in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activating the synchronising mode when two folders are compared and no target folder is specified. in this mode, the proposals are identical to the merge. also, the results from the merge of files are stored in both folders. this option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">In case there are differences, instead of merge the newer file is suggested as an action. (this is considered insecure, because it is considered insure that the other file is not altered as well. you should check this in any case.) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or a file is replaced or deleted by another file, then the original version will be renamed. if an old backup file is already existing, this will also be deleted without further backup. this option also applies to normal interaction. this option is enabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally, the folder merge view remains visible to the merge of individual files; you can disable the window divider over the window. if you don't want to set the windows & text window, turn the windows & text window between the two views.</seg>
<seg id="2415">Probably you prefer to compare a file just with double-click. however, there is a single file directly connected without having to start the folder. after you save the result, the status will be done directly and the file will not run again when you start the folder.</seg>
<seg id="2416">However, this status is lost when you read the directory again: directory menu: re-read</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency with the help of Kio slaves. Kdiff3 uses this to read files and folders. in this way, you can specify files and folders to open on local or remote computers.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with one FTP server. the second command line resembles a folder inside a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax as local files and folders. a few things should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can contain relatively small or.. included. this is not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be massaged. (# - &gt;% 23, spaces show - &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file named / # foo # the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes because of the file system on the server, sometimes through the protocol used. it follows a short list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it can not be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows. then, a file is accepted as a link finish. (FTP:, SFTP:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way to edit authorization or change date. therefore, the permissions or change date are made from the original. (note that this option is only possible with local files).</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main reason for this purpose is currently as the difference-viewer in KDevelop. KDevelop starts to start the built-in differences viewer. to start Kdiff3, press the right mouse button and then select in Kdiff3Part from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Normally needs & kdiff3; two complete input files. if it is applied as a part, take & kdiff3; the names of the original files from the patch file. at least one of the two files must exist. then, & kdiff3; the patch to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the context menu, you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - KDiff3Part. also, please note that if none of the original files exists. furthermore, this is unreliable when the original files have changed since generation of patch file.</seg>
<seg id="2428">If & kdiff3; as part is executed, it only supports the comparison of two files, a very small tool bar and menu. the merge or comparison of folders is not supported in the KPart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and Kdiff2 (now it's comppare) are already available. furthermore, the name Kdiff3 is already pointing out that it can merge together like the diff3 program from the diff utility collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I use GPL-programs very long and have learned a lot in the sources of other programs. this is my thank you to all programmers who have gone this way or going to go so.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You have compiled the program from the sources and probably not disclosed the correct prefix to KDE. in the default run configure in / usr / local, but then KDE could not find resources for the user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you will find further information on this subject.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters is different, these lines are first treated as identical, but if only one non-white character is different, the line will be treated as not identical. iF is the lines of next to each other, this caris coincidence as the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor is noticeable for any difference in the files where it begins and where he ends. this important information is simply lost when clicking into the source code and select the button A / B / C, and it is too much effort to design extra a private file format that could save this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The cost for this has been too large so far. you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C. to process large quantities of text, another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text is suddenly lt; No src left; published, and the lyrics cannot be extinguished. what does that mean and how can it be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; use many colors to emphasize differences. even more emphasis would be confusing and mislacking the purpose. please use another editor.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and troubleshooting came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all functions of & kdiff3; you need & kde; 3.1 or later.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information on how to use Kdiff3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">A list of recent changes can be found under http: / / kdiff3.sourceforge.net / Changelog or in the file Changelog in the Quell package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile and install & kdiff3; on a system with & kde; to compile and install, use the following command in the basic folder of & kdiff3; -Distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir gives the folder to your system installed in which KDE is installed. if you are unsure, you will find further details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Da & kdiff3; autoconf and automake use, you should not have problems with compile. if difficulties are encountered, please report on the & kde; Mailing lists thereof.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut out (Ctrl-X or Shift-Remove) into the clipboard and delete the selected text. insert the text from the clipboard at the current cursor position or replaces the current marking.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Only differences: files that are identical in all folders are not appear in the folder structure and thus also not in the target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version you need to update the folder with the function refresh to these options.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">There are only entries to show the differences. this also causes identical files to merge in the target folder. if the target folder does not contain these files, they are missing after the merge. (the behavior is probably modified in a later program version.) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons to choose from the source with labeling A, B and C below the menu bar. if you're on one of the buttons, the lines are attached to the end of the selected group in the result window (if the lines are already present), they will be back to the button in the button.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In default, this option is disabled. underscores in individual characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated as differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & kpager; displays a miniature preview of all virtual desktops. it is quite convenient to change the running programs on the working areas to stop her size or move them. this works in both a desktop and with several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & kpager; can display all virtual workspaces as well as running applications. applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and at other.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button, windows can be moved within & kpager. movement is possible in both a desktop and other working areas.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on where the right mouse click is clicked on, if on the empty background of & kpager; clicked on, the context menu has to set up only the two entries Pager. if, on an application within & kpager. if you click on an application within & kpager. if you click on an application within & kpager. if you click on an application within & kpager. if you click on an application within & kpager. if you click on a log file, the name and the entries will appear, maximize, on desktop and refering. commands include the following:</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window to the full size of desktop. appears only if clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sends the application to select the selected virtual desktop. only appears if clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this check box is marked, windows can be moved inside & kpager; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop, and also on other areas of work.</seg>
<seg id="2457">When this field is crossed, the name of the virtual workspace will be displayed in & kpager.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Cross the rim of this field makes the & kpager; show the numbers of virtual workspace. if it is crossed with name, the names are indicated with ordinal numbers, & eg; 1. desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2459">If this field is crossed, the background of each desktop is also displayed as a background in & kpager.</seg>
<seg id="2460">If this field is crossed, the running programs are displayed as small windows at & kpager. otherwise, only empty working areas are displayed to allow their selection.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here the view of the program window is selected. simple right corner with the proportions of the program window. symbol shows the window with its standard symbol and Pixmap shows a small view of the real program window. note: Pixmap is only recommended for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here the arrangement of the & kpager; main windows can be determined: classically moved & kpager; in a 2xn-grid, all virtual workplace will appear in a horizontal row and perpendicular in a vertical row, which is very good for viewing on the side of the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & kpager; can be used as an alternative to the Pager Miniprogram in the control bar. it has the advantage that it can be changed in size, window as symbols or with its content. furthermore, it runs outside the control bar.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Click the right mouse button within & kpager; then set up a switch from the switch... lets the dialog box appear.</seg>
<seg id="2465">Currently this cannot be changed in the dialog box. but you can do it manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kpagerrc with any text editor such as & kedit; or VI. If you don't need to register as user root or sign up to your system administrator. in this file you have to sign the key windowtransparentmode and assign it to this value. possible values are:</seg>

<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulates a mouse click once the mouse cursor is waiting for a while at the same place. it is intended to help people suffering pain in the repetitive penalty of Injury (RSI). furthermore, it can emulate the pulling with the mouse. however, this requires little exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can handle the pain, which is created when clicking the mouse, can also cause a lot of people to use the computer without pain. unfortunately, you suffer from pain, which are related to using your computer, if this is not done yet.</seg>
<seg id="2500">In order to clarify it again: even if & kmousetool; pains can help when clicking with the mouse, it is against pain, which is caused by moving the mouse, useless and as with all ergonomic auxiliary means: the result can be different for each different.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movements and leads a mouse click as soon as you break the movement briefly.</seg>
<seg id="2502">Is the intelligent shift activates, makes & kmousetool; a break, wait until the end of the move, wait until the end of the move, before leaving the mouse button. on this way, you can drag the drawing at an impressive button, but you get used to get a little practice, but you get used to it quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This time period must be stored after the end of the mouse motion, before & kmousetool; click a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2504">Is Intelligentes move on, turning the turnout time (1 / 10 s), the time is set, the & kmousetool; after shutdown the mouse button, before it comes back the mouse button, if there is no result of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2505">& kmousetool; now supports clicking on the right and back, followed by a break, a click with the right mouse button. a slow moving backwards. these movements are stored in the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kmousetool _ strokes.txt for the first time, but they can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">When the sound appears slowed, you can & kde; to move the response time. open the Sound & Multimedia, select the Sound System and here the tab General. there, you can set the sound system and here the tab General. there, you can set a lower value in order to reduce the response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting is selected, & kmousetool should start; at any start of & kde; when this function is only available at & kde; please refer to the respective documentation to find out how you automatically start a program.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Put all settings back to the values when opening the dialog. have you already pressed the button users, the settings are reset to the level after pressing the dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2509">Best use & kmousetool; first with the presets. in particular, the intelligent move should be turned off at first. if you got used to automatic click, you may later take the smart move.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it is necessary to decrease the response times of & kde; at sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First of all, you should make aware of what places a mouse click without effect: clicking on the neutral components of windows or on places in the browser window that cannot park a link, so you can park the mouse in such places until you want to use them again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">If your mouse brackles, you should clean your mouse. it is normally quite simple. the trick is that you can not only clean the mouse ball, but also the roles, which come into contact with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First, you need to remove the mouse ball. as this happens, mouse to mouse is different, but it should be quickly clear if you're looking at the bottom of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you would have to see the roles. these are located on the sides of the hole, into which the ball was used. dirt and soiling are easily scratched with a flat blade or your fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations the operating system interrupts the execution of & kmousetool; if you use smart shifts in this case, it means that & kmousetool; surgery is no longer able to exit the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmousetool; use a window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem is that you carry out a mouse click. this is the status of & kmousetool; return and you can continue to work as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: when you enter a text, try & kmousetool; continue to run mouse clicks and set the cursor in another place.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use mouse to place the cursor to place where you want to make it. but you can't park your mouse on a neutral area of desktop, if you are not able to cause any of the mouse pointer. secure zones for the mouse pointer are & eg; the grey areas around the toolbar and menus and the windows of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with smart shifts, but I don't create it to edit text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The intelligent move is an advanced function of & kmousetool; and it takes its time before you can handle it and move it into the clipboard to move it into the clipboard, or to move it into the clipboard. but it will probably cause them to cause problems. here are some advice:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use intelligent shifts, if you just start to use & kmousetool; to use. select text instead: guide the mouse cursor to the other end of the text, and press the mouse button again.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse click. this makes every time when & kmousetool; the mouse clicks is played a sound like a mouse click. so you know exactly when smart shifts starts to use it without the audible mouse click. however, it requires some exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To use & kmousetool; use the XTest extension for & X window; it should be installed on most of the system.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse clicks is only available when the system has a sound card and speakers, and it is correct.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; activates the mouse button as soon as the mouse cursor is briefly stopped. this program was developed for people who suffer from the RSI syndrome, to which the people of the brightest pain is prepared.</seg>
<seg id="2527">& kmousetool; can also be configured so that there is a certain time waiting for a pulling procedure before the mouse button begins. in this way, pulling and off with the mouse can also be performed.</seg>

<seg id="2799">The & Ccontrolcenter; allows the user to manage a set of system and desktop settings via a uniform, integrated surface. the & kcontrolcenter; can be accessed by selecting K Menu kcontrolcenter;</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & knetworkconf; package was developed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from & knetworkconf; create a simple surface for the following tasks:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After installation, a new module network settings in & kcontrolcenter; displays network settings (knetworkconf;) can be launched by selecting the controlcenter; internet & network network settings in & kmenu.</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & knetworkconf; network hardware doesn't install. physical devices and their drivers have to be operational and configured to enable & knetworkconf; the device features and setting the network properties.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases, drivers for the network hardware and other devices are added while installing and set up Linux; network devices are added later, the driver must be loaded by adjusting the following files, corresponding to the kernel version:</seg>
<seg id="2804">"" "the module network settings will be loaded when setting network settings at & controlcenter;" "" "Options" "" "index, this is trying to detect the used platform on the system automatically." ""</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform cannot be recognized, the manual selection is offered. it is the platform from the list to select the distribution and releasestand. by checking the setting no-again the setting can be hit-permanently. on the next start of the network settings this option is automatically preset.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Changing the network settings are possible only in system management mode. before, all options are displayed gray, which means changing settings can only be considered, changing the settings mode at the bottom bottom of the module. it is required to enter the password.</seg>
<seg id="2807">In the system management mode, the module's entire functionality is available. it is divided into three riders:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The tab network interface serves to manage network appliances. all available network appliances will be displayed. from the tab network interfaces, the following tasks can be performed:</seg>
<seg id="2809">Set the settings shown by selecting the desired device in the list and click the button to set up... in the dialog device.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. click the button to indicate the dialog with further possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="2811">With the selection Automatically, the TCP / IP settings are made by a DHCP server, or BOOTP Server. in automatic mode, the TCP / IP settings are done at any system start, therefore no further option is required. in the selective list, you can either choose DHCP or BOOTP server. in the selective list, you can either choose DHCP or BOOTP, according to the system.</seg>
<seg id="2812">You can specify the TCP / IP address without DHCP or BOOTP. in the IP address, the TCP / IP address must specify the required TCP / IP address.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this setting is checked, the system initializes the network interface when booting. if the initialization is not desired, this option should not be enabled.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values given in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be ensured that the IP address is not already used in the network. with ping in the IP address, you can see whether the address is already in use. in doubt, the network administrator should be asked.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Network devices can be activated or switched off if required. switching on the network device is activated by selecting from the list and click interface...</seg>
<seg id="2817">Network devices can be activated or switched off depending on your needs. setting off an activated network device is activated by selecting from the list and clicking interface...</seg>
<seg id="2818">Sets the IP address of the computer in the local subnet, which provides the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with computers in other subnetworks.</seg>
<seg id="2819">If the computer is more than a network interface, the interface must be connected to the network where the gateway computer is located.</seg>
<seg id="2820">A machine with DNS support is replaced by the corresponding IP address. this is necessary because computers only demands IP addresses. if the calculator http: / / www.einedomain.org, DNS dissolves this name into an IP address, such as approx. 123,5678.90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">"" "the calculator on the name resolution is a simple administration of this list. entries can be added, removed or modified .DNS entries can be removed by selecting an application and up or downgrading in the list with buttons and below in the priority." ""</seg>
<seg id="2822">When pressing the button you add... from the machine calculator to name resolution you can add a DNS server. it will be added to the New Nameserver dialogue.</seg>
<seg id="2823">First you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the button to add. the entry will be inserted in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2824">From the computer machine to the name resolution, select an entry and then click on the button Edit.... It will be shown in the dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2825">The list of well-known computers describes the hostname-to-IP address references for the TCP / IP subsystem. it is used primarily when booting, if no DNS server is available. in small, closed networks it can replace DNS servers.</seg>
<seg id="2826">Normally, the list of well-known computers contains some entries to support & apos; localhostapos; and some special IPv6 addresses. this is still in the test to replace IP 4 in the future version 4.</seg>
<seg id="2827">Enter the IP address of the well-known computer and click Add.... The New alias will be added as well.</seg>
<seg id="2828">Enter the name of the well-known computer and click the Add button. if the known computer has multiple alias name, de button add several times and enter the other alias name.</seg>
<seg id="2829">Select an entry of a well-known computer from the list and select Edit.... The dialog's dialog is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2830">It can be done one of the following tasks, then with clicking OK, the list of static hosts will be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2831">The settings made in the network settings are not effective immediately. in order to activate the changes, the following command must be set in a & console; the following command must be set.</seg>
<seg id="2832">The homepage from & knetworkconf; http: / / knetworkconf.sourceforge.net, from which you can download the latest version of the source text.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For installing the binary distributions (usually rpm packages), it is enough if & kde; and Qt are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the finished version is recommended for less experienced users. it's easy to download the rpm package and install in a & console; with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a tool can be used with a graphic interface like kpackage or the installation tool of your distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2836">For this case, the installation of Qt and & kde; not, but additionally the development packages are needed with libraries and other things.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is only recommended users. however, it is not difficult to compile & knetworkconf; the following commands should afford this.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information on basic network technology will be given, in the second one will be discussed by & knetworkconf; changed configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This section can not replace more information about IP networks. in this appendix, only basic information about the integration of the PC is conveyed into a small (home) network.</seg>
<seg id="2840">IP networks are currently being operated with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv5 has never found great dissemination. therefore, it is expected to focus on the widespread IPv4 in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is the knowledge of the IP address of a network interface. in external networks, at & eg; Workplace is the network administrator to address a valid IP address, if available, the IP address cannot be chosen arbitrarily!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When applying an own small (home) network, the IP address should be chosen from a specially designed area to avoid IP address conflicts with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded to the Internet, therefore its use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting up a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, addresses are usually used in the range of 192.168.1.1 through 192.168.1.254. the area is big enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the net mask is set to 255.255.255.0, so that all hosts are in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.03; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the second the loopback address (localhost = of your machine). the default route is needed for IP transfer.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The 127.0.0.1 power address is reserved for IP traffic in the local own machine. normally the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to a very called loopback interface, which works like a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">In this part, the configuration files are affected by & knetworkconf, where they are stored in the various distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes modified with DSL connections, so it will not be surprised if there is no other content in the case of active DSL connections.</seg>
<seg id="2850">For & SuSE; it is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in SuSEconfig. another stand as expected can therefore occur.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& kdat; is a backup program for tape drives based on tar. it offers the opportunity to save multiple archives on a tape. the first goal was to create multiple archives in a band. the second goal was to answer a question that my wife stated: how much longer does it take?</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a band can be used, it must be embedded by & kdat; it can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& kdat; spin the tape back and reads the prestressing information of the tape. recognize & kdat; if the tape does not know, you will be asked if the band is formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Detects & kdat; it searches for the matching index on your record. if it cannot be found, you will be asked if the band index is to be reconstructed.</seg>
<seg id="2897">Everything went smoothly, the symbol for the tape drive, to indicate that the band has been merged. in the status bar, a corresponding message appears. the contents of the tape can now be searched by flaps of the entry for the band.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before laying down the tape, the integration must first be solved. there are three methods to accomplish this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& kdat; can be seen by changing the symbol for the band that the binding for the tape has been solved and displays the status bar a corresponding message. the tape can now be discarded without any danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a band of & kdat; it can be used, it must be formatted by & kdat; formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2901">A bandaging need to formatted before you can use formatting at & kdat. if you need to formatted a tape before use, you need to formatted a tape before use. floppy disk drives usually do not require formatting of the tape, DAT drives, on the other hand.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the band name and the capacity drives & kdat; with the formatting of the tape. all data on the tape are lost thereby! after completion of the formatting, the tape is automatically integrated and ready for use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you encounter the backup procedure, you need to select the securing files. this can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in a local file tree. only this file or folder will be secured.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Mark a backup profile in the tree. only the files specified in the profile are secured.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Mark files in the local file tree with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders are secured.</seg>
<seg id="2907">With the right mouse button, click on the local file tree and select in the Sheep...</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup was introduced, the dialog window will open for backup. in this dialog you can check the selected files and change the settings for backup.</seg>
<seg id="2909">"" "" "" "when you have confirmed the settings, the dialog appears." "" "the dialog shows the progress of the backup process including data rate and the remaining time." ""</seg>
<seg id="2910">Mark a file or folder in one of the archives in the record for the drive. only the selected file or folder will be checked.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Mark the files in one of the archives in the record for the band with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders are checked.</seg>
<seg id="2912">With the right mouse button, click on one of the archives and select the menu entry...</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the test procedure has been started, the dialog appears for checking. in this dialog you can check your selection and change the job folders for review.</seg>
<seg id="2914">When you have confirmed the settings for checking, the dialog appears. this dialog shows the progress of checking and the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before you can run the restore, the files you will need to be selected. this can be done in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives belong to the band's work. only the selected file or subfolders will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select the files you want from one of the archive with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2918">Right click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select a folder....</seg>

<seg id="2920">"" "" "" "when you have confirmed the settings for recovery, the dialog appears. this dialog shows the progress of recovery and the data throughput and the remaining time." ""</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it proves to be necessary to regenerate the bandindexfile based on the band content. this process deletes all existing index files for this band. you can regenerate the index on two ways of the band:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This is a fuse profile with the selected files and default settings. you can make the following settings for a backup profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current working folder where the backup is to be made. the list of files to be secured is automatically updated accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all folders which are listed under backup files, the files are stored on the same file system, such as the folder. folder, which are located on other file systems, you may register separately under backup files. every entry is detected by tar independently from the other.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Perform an incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot is used. only the files have changed since then.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file, which is used to make changes since the last incremental backup is used.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Delete the snapshot file before calling tar. this causes all files to be secured and a new snapshot file for the next backup is created.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The buttons of buttons files & gt; lt; and lt; files were not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">You can set up the Settings menu item KDat... in Settings menu. you can make the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The full path to the device file for the tape drive (normally / dev / Tape). this path must refer to the non-process variant of the band device.</seg>
<seg id="2931">If this setting is active, transmitted & kdat; before the tape is integrated into the drive. at some drives, this is necessary before reading or write operations can be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is enabled, & kdat is trying to block the outlet for the band run. maybe this setting does not work with all tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is enabled, the release is kicked off by & kdat; automatically releasing the tape. do not use this option for floppy drive.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is switched on, & kdat; not all drives support variable block sizes. no matter whether this setting is active or not, you need & kdat; in any case you need to inform the block size for your bandry.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & kdat; a tape is formatted, it writes a file to the start of the band. this file should only compile a memory block on the tape. the content of the file is composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n Byte) The band ID. the format of this string is the name name: seconds, where the name is the complete name of the system, on which the tape has been formatted. seconds is the number of seconds passed since the time when the tape has been formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file using the same name in the $HOME / .kdat file.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The remaining files on the tape are pure tar archive which can be done directly with & GNU; - tar. even other tar versions should work as long as it is not about incremental backups.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Check the contents of a backup. this symbol is only active when a tape is integrated.</seg>
<seg id="2940">& ksystemlog; is a & kde; viewer for system logs. the program is suitable for inexperienced users, where you can get information about your system or where the system allows you to get information about your system. in addition, & ksystemlog; experienced users can use quick access to information on problems that appear on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystemlog; helps users to understand what your computer is in the background. the task is suitable for unfamiliar users who cannot know where you can get information about your system or where the system stored the different protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">Moreover, & ksystemlog; experienced users can perform quick access for example on information about problems that can appear on their server. & ksystemlog; therefore tries to provide some advanced features which can be filtered and evaluated by certain programs.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1, & ksystemlog; a number of useful functions. these include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of the Syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you can see in the following screen photo, & ksystemlog; functions are available, with their help the individual protocol lines of a protocol file easily filtering and sort out. the individual ways to sorting and filters are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After the start & ksystemlog; first the most important protocol-file of the system - to open, and it opens instead of its a small message window, so you'll find it instead of system administrators. the protocol files usually doesn't have access to read in the folder / var / log, for which normal users do not have access to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filter out according to a selected criterion or according to the filter box. in the default setting, set a log file next to the selected filter. then, a log line will display only if in one of the columns contain the character string of the filter search.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can also select another entry at this point. in addition, select the string searches in the selected column, and then select the name of a process in the log bar. then, select & ksystemlog; all log lines, which were sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in default settings and helps you detect the important protocol-lines. protocol lines of level errors are displayed using a showy color as protocol-lines of the stage. the colour display of protocol-rows can be disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to view a certain process (for example, in the system protocol or cron protocol), then you can examine the process identification (PID) in column process, for example, if you want to examine the output of a certain command as for example to start the samba server. in this case you use filter bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can activate the option on new lines in context menu of the main window to display all new added protocol-lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemlog; allows the display of several protocol files in separate sub-windows. to use this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open up and manage. once you select a subwindow, select a protocol on display.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has a website based on http: / / systemlog.forum software-software.org Dort you will find more recent information about the sources of & ksystemlog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; you can also find in the following folder of the & kde; Subversion Archives: ksystemlog; in & kde; archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known (and in the following as named) as & ksysv; this section guides some concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv;</seg>
<seg id="2957">The System V Init rapidly develops into the standard for controlling the system starts at the upswing of the system in the & Linux; and therefore, because it's easier to use, more powerful and more flexible than the traditional BSD -Init system.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go on historical aspects here (e.g. because I don't know about it: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The Init binary is below / sbin and not under / etc. this is why perhaps someone could try to switch a machine to System V init, without a re-installation and re-format. so you need to make sure that the old Init was removed from there if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SYSV Init also differs from the BSD Init that the configuration files in a subfolder of / etc are instead of directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.sysinit and following other folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d includes a whole bunch of scripts. basically you need a script for each system service you want to run on the upswing of the system or when switching to another runlevel. system services do not include such things like setserial, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not include such things as setserial, which only once started. such calls belong to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should be under / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even if you do not have much use of this. you can also create a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to do something with the serial port.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel is looking for different places following the init program and starts the first one to find.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default runlevel is in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point you can take a look at the second column, and probably tell you that the default runlevel 3 is. if you want to change this, then you can fix / etc / inquire, then you come to repair it by restart the system and execute the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it take all the right scripts? if you enter -l in rc3.d, then you probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that in this folder doesn't find any right files. instead, each entry is a link to one of the scripts in directory init.d.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How does it start and stops init actually system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is written such a argument as start and stop. you can actually start this scripts out of hand on the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would hold the httpd server. init reads the name, and if the one contains, the script will be called by stop. if it includes a S, the script will be called using the argument.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people wish to set up a simple way of creating machines for many purposes. I could run & eg; a server lap, which can only run httpd, & Sendmail;, Network & etc;, moreover, I could also have a user lap, the & eg; & kdm;, Network & etc;.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn the use of & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; using a mouse or another pointer is simple to say trivial: simply drag a record from the field of availables to one of the six runlevel to start it on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move scripts between runlevelling, or change the position within a level by taking it somewhere else. this will not happen if they move from its original runlevel (or its position). this happens only if they draw an entry from the field of availability.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries will be postponed if you select them to a new section. in order to copy them to a new runlevel, you must explicitly select copying from the menu Edit or from the context menu, and then if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you need to edit the sorting inputs before attempting to insert the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: there is no way to restore entries, which were cast into the trash bin. be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tab button to activate the different work areas (available system services, runlevel 1 start, runlevel 1 stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection upper or below the previous.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry into another runlevel, move it with cutting into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it to the desired runlevel with insertion (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the sorting number or the name of a single entry, press the input button to change the Properties dialog. close the dialog by typing the input button to accept changes, or press Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of loss of data, all entries in the menu requires a confirmation before being executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / ksysvrc. preferences will be taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if it is available. otherwise, they will be saved by & ksysv; resumes. changes to default are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have experimented with the standard laptops, and now the machine restarts to retire. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO-Prompt linux single and press the input button to start in the user-user mode. then edit the file / etc / inquire and change the default runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should be normally fine).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have provided some system services with & ksysv; for execution under runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you are using & SuSE; or Delix (DLD) then you need to edit additional files in / etc, which are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of the distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way, how system services are started in these distributions, but does not simplify the proprietary setup programs of these distributions, but unfortunately no standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using a different distribution, please check if all configuration files are needed (and also whether they are in the right directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache or httpd) are easy to terminate when their configuration files are not available or wrong.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The importance of & Linux; the runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you use a different distribution, please send me information on the runlevel to allow these to be added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & kuser; it's sufficient to read the chapter customization of & kuser;</seg>
<seg id="2991">After making any changes you have to save, you must save them. either you use the corresponding symbol of toolbar or the Save In menu.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& kuser; is an easy application. the main window consists of two card cards, user and user-trousers. to do, select the desired user or the desired group with a double click on the record. it appears the dialog user and group properties.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some flashcards will only be displayed when you have advanced system settings. only if you can make advanced system settings, if you can make individual adjustments, if shadow passwords, or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed in BSD slices.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The card password will appear if shadow passwords, or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed in BSD slices.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card card only appears if for at least one-bound file system (Quota) is activated and initialized (identifiable at the file quotas user / quotas group on the file system). here, the limitation limits can be changed for each user parameters:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set separately for each file system. the current file system is selected with the help of the field file system.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The boxes are informed about the group submissions of the selected user. the standard group, to which the user is owned, can be found in the Primsen group. furthermore, the user can become a member in other groups by marking them in the large field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The Group's dialog features a list of users. to add a user to the group, mark this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or a group, choose from the user menu or group or click the matching Add button of the tool bar. editing or delete the selected user or the selected group works analog.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module you can install the LILO Boat Manager, remove, remove and change the time to the booting of the standard operating system to remove, remove, modify, modify, modify, and more.</seg>
