although I had visited the USA since 2012 at least once a year , I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love of America is extraordinary .
how many of my generation grew up with American movies , I have danced American music and operated by American authors .
in fact , this country had a profound effect on me that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film .
as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , like he played the Gray Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican &apos;s letter , a fear@@ less rep@@ orter , who made his attention inc@@ lined with Julia Roberts as a Jura @-@ Student , who were the Supreme Court of Justice who had his interest to occupy .
I was caught .
&quot; &quot; &quot; freely to Method One , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was as if that &apos;s the absolute Truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona , my admir@@ ation for the USA was only strengthened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I always said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; America is the only country where I ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting you can always be that you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of equal people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I even had a very shy love letter about his size .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
a lot was written about the x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most unusual aspect of his asc@@ ension is for me as he is dealing with his de@@ w@@ dness .
he never keeps his mind behind the mountain , as you say so beautiful .
he says exactly what he thinks about how a former colleague re@@ pressed , and explains publicly his contemp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro@@ American and Women .
nevertheless , people responded to their statements and voted in dro@@ ves for him .
the 13 million votes he won in the rep@@ ubli@@ can elections , was the highest number ever achieved by the party .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ ot person , I asked myself ?
I could not make Tr@@ ump and his voters in accordance with the people I met during my time in Phoenix .
as for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism program , taking people from all over the world , with whom I could talk about Islam and its past .
Tr@@ um@@ ps Welt@@ anschau@@ ung did not agree with Peter Bh@@ atia , the current editor of the &quot; Cincinnati In@@ quir@@ er , &quot; which is the present editor .
Bh@@ atia and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to watch the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game .
Tr@@ um@@ ps In@@ tolerance is also in contrast to the gener@@ osity that I had with Sandy B@@ ahr , who fought for their lives long the environment , and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me like their son .
she is still adap@@ ting to the engagement of Krist@@ i K@@ app@@ es , which always helped me to get used to the complexity of American life .
then , there were Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors who helped me a lot in my career .
these people and they em@@ bodied in them deep@@ ened my love of America .
as Tr@@ ump left his way to the nominated Republi@@ can Presi@@ dency , they offered me a stop and counter@@ part in his limited vision of America .
however , it turned out that they were the exception of rule .
on 8 November 2016 , over 50 million Americans , mostly white , the presidency of a man , despite - or perhaps just because of his contemp@@ t against non @-@ white people .
the confron@@ tation with the idea that humans have voted for tr@@ ump , because they were distributed either to rac@@ ism and fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism , because they were willing to over@@ see these things , nearly broke my heart .
maybe it is un@@ fair to call the tr@@ ump v@@ oter than Ras@@ si@@ gh .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is superf@@ icial and respec@@ tful and imp@@ lies an in@@ ability to understand those who act in another way and think .
it shows the people that their wor@@ ries and fears are not taken into account of the hec@@ tic changes in their communities .
could it be that those voters , of which most white are tuned for tr@@ ump , because they want to reg@@ ain control over a country that has disappointed them ?
in other words , they may say that they are still important in this America ?
maybe .
however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comments the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contemp@@ t upon those who look different .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( indication of the White People against all other eth@@ nic@@ ities ; word game from white in play on the White and whi@@ pl@@ ash , which means as much as Sch@@ leu@@ der@@ trau@@ ma ) , as it was the great Van Jones called , exactly what is so great . &quot; &quot; &quot;
millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality , it is still a powerful idea - what faith or background you like , America is everyone welcome .
for this country chose as its president , twice the son of an Ken@@ ian@@ er , his story as he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible .
with the election Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps , however , gives a huge proportion of the white Americas that promise to and say : hell with diversity , religious freedom and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 the white man is back on Ru@@ der , they say .
with all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier , who fell in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
at a rally for Hillary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , if my son , captain Hum@@ ay@@ un K@@ ahn , would have a place in your America ? &quot; Mr. Khan asked .
the crowd answered with a loud &quot; No ! &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; the crowd was ro@@ ared .
&quot; have Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
no ! &quot; they answered them .
do A@@ fr@@ o Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they cried and their voices were loud .
&quot; if anyone who is not like you , is a place in your America ? &quot;
he received a unanim@@ ous and vo@@ cable &quot; NO &quot; !
Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , isn &apos;t that your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected .
the land for which his son fell , sent him a message .
this is now Tr@@ um@@ ps Country , the news said .
and all the people that look like Mr. Khan , could not find any place in this new America .
and this breaks my heart .

what has the Mexican music school of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero congregation in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca , together with the children of the par@@ agu@@ a@@ ean city of C@@ ate@@ ura ?
the music that is played in both places , not only the life of children , but also a very close connection with ...
music , which lives with the waste
Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump , just 16 km south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial town that is very popular among tourists , but the worlds away from nearby pre@@ colonies and its world @-@ famous cuisine .
for several years , La B@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( music ban@@ de ) plays in the community : one of the children and adults of existing symph@@ ony orchestra , which has been found with their musical instruments , an opportunity for over@@ coming poverty .
a school school with 100 students for the community of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca became a central interest .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the community that is located in one of the p@@ oo@@ rest provinces of Mexico is known for its drug abuse and gangs .
but this changed after a random encounter with a French pilots who started a musical project and the youth offered so rare hop@@ el@@ essly .
young band members take their obligations very seriously compared to the music group , says the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI :
once they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion .
they always come laughing and playing with shiny eyes and play in the chest you meet day for trumpet , trombone , pic@@ colo , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , forest horn , tim@@ pan@@ i , Bon@@ gos and the Con@@ ga .
music from tr@@ ash
more than 7@@ ,000 kilometers south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero are the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village located at the top of the largest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ on in Paraguay , on instruments that are made from recycled waste material :
music with re@@ plen@@ ished instruments made from local firm waste materials , produced in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where the recy@@ c@@ ler have begun under the bat@@ on of F@@ avi@@ o Chávez with them to transform parts of decay into instruments .
the instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viola , c@@ elli , contra@@ bass , guitar , fl@@ utes , trump@@ ets , trump@@ ets , trump@@ ets , trump@@ ets , trump@@ ets and drums .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as the Beatles music , by Frank Sin@@ atra , etc .
in an article in the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Chávez , a local environmental schol@@ ar and music teacher of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , at the initial time :
at first it was very difficult because we had no place to rehear@@ se and we had to teach in the same place where the parents had no music and it was very difficult to contact us because many of them do not live together with their children .
that changed as F@@ avi@@ o something that he had never seen before : a violin made of waste .
today , there is a whole orchestra which plays on instruments from re@@ plen@@ ished material and is called The Recy@@ cled Orchestra .
a documentary &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic garbage dump ) shows the musical performance on :
the world produces about one billion metric tons of rub@@ b@@ ish every year .
those who live with him and of him are the Trou@@ ble - like men in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they turn him into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspiring play of tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra even played his music before Pope Francis :
these ost@@ African countries show how technology and team@@ work can fight illegal fishing
photo © F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that fights wild illegal fishing .
this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that targeted solutions for environmental problems .
the rest@@ ation happens in the context of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for the common use of Content .
in West Africa , it was known that this ship had already run illegal fishing waters before finding the other coast of Africa .
the East African countries were raised accordingly , and slightly inc@@ lined to welcome a law@@ suit of this kind in their co@@ asts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the com@@ ore , Mozambique and the Seychelles mobili@@ zed quickly against the ship . they refused to buy one of its har@@ bours and refused to share a fishing agency .
&quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries which simply refused to do everything , &quot; he re@@ members Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a leading employee of the Ken@@ yan fish@@ eries agency . he is part of a team that discovered and followed the ship .
in 2013 the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region : it wasn &apos;t succeeded to catch fish there .
finally , it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia , due to pill@@ aging the country &apos;s fish stocks .
the nu@@ cle@@ us of this initiative , which protects criminal practices and protects resources was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the N@@ RO stop illegal F@@ ishing ( Il@@ legal F@@ ishing stop ) .
the members of this network are the six countries in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , who then displac@@ ed the Premier from their waters .
&quot; we have eight countries that are consistent and working together . they exchange information and stand each other when it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; says Tony Long , head of the Pe@@ w Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts project En@@ ding illeg@@ ally F@@ ishing . this project offers F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support .
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , absent because it is extremely difficult to locate it . thus illegal fishing is a leading cause of over@@ fishing of regions .
due to the obvious mis@@ contemp@@ t of existing laws , using those specific habit@@ ats and types are to harm the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystem , which have a delicate balance .
but while actions against illegal fishing were hin@@ dered by bureau@@ cratic hur@@ dles , and also through the snow@@ fl@@ emp@@ o , with the information between individual countries , so the actions happen in real time , with trace@@ able to F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
there , individual countries , for example , can exchange lists of existing licenses , news on suspic@@ ious activities or details that you had noticed or experienced during a port inspection .
fish @-@ i tracks the activities of ships also very attentive , if they move on the open sea , using satellite data .
this allows the authorities to mark the ships that fish in forbidden areas . there are also such suspic@@ ious driving routes - such that a ship invites its caught fish on the way to other ships .
ideally , such exam@@ inations indicate whether the participating ships have a fish catch license where they were traveling and possibly even if they have a criminal register .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; countries who are against illegal fishing , can then refuse to the assum@@ ption of such ships in their har@@ bours . what means that the ships cannot sell their cargo . and that they may even be forced to pay pun@@ ishments , as in the case of the Premier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then it &apos;s about considerable financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is not worthwhile . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , executive director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a Ber@@ ing company which is committed to fight illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a closed front
the already mentioned platform was created to gain an estimated $ 20 million to lost revenue , which are losing eight members of the network H@@ ISH @-@ i every year due to Il@@ legal Fischer , who penet@@ rate the East African waters .
East Africa has become one of the most productive tuna fishing companies , which attracts the region &apos;s commercial fishing tra@@ des from around the world . among these also illegal fishermen .
among other practices , actions include like sailing under false flag , f@@ ake licensing documents , st@@ ating phant@@ as@@ sel@@ seeds , fish protected species and fish in protected areas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they use the lack of international cooperation and take advantage of the weak@@ nesses of a non complete organised control system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , a ship was illeg@@ ally fishing and a country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You must not walk down my harbour . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but another country could say &apos; Kom@@ m to me &apos; . &quot; and exactly this legal end hole tries to close F@@ ISH @-@ i .
so far the closed front works .
since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH @-@ i was involved in more than 30 exam@@ inations of suspected ships .
it has been revealed criminal networks that had counter@@ feit licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships used by several frau@@ dul@@ ent ident@@ ities and has been pursu@@ ing it .
due to his cooperation with Inter@@ pol , the international authority on the fight of crimes , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share information about illegal fishing over large distances .
&quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime , &quot; says Ber@@ gh .
he builds a system that will help F@@ ISH @-@ i susp@@ ects even more precise ships .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is always developed further , also helps to hide the illegal boats .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , Head analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , a N@@ RO , which also deals with fish@@ eries data and F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships , for example , turn their automatic identification systems , with which they can no longer be ordered by satellite .
Cop@@ eland helps to build a system that connects different information of information . it should help F@@ ISH @-@ i to find crimin@@ ational ships with greater precision .
a model program
but F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team can actually influence African nations &apos;s global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO sky@@ Truth , believes that .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened jointly with Google and the Marine Protection Agency Oce@@ ana the Platform Global F@@ ishing Watch : a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed worldwide by the position of each individual trace@@ able ship worldwide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accum@@ ulate with the neighbors to get a better image of what is doing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is simply sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and explo@@ it their resources . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this on global level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pe@@ w Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project with which a global system allows the prosecution of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities do not only detect crimin@@ als , but also loc@@ ust@@ s them .
ships who conf@@ is@@ cated without license and had hardly to reck@@ on with consequences , know that they are ob@@ serving .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the participating countries took part in F@@ ISH @-@ i by a 33 % increase in fish@@ eries , since fis@@ her boats sold more licenses .
after having helped by F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia , Gre@@ ko 1 found the det@@ ectors on board tow @-@ nets , whose use is prohibited .

&quot; &quot; &quot; other countries are not@@ icing this successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now even copy other countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in West Africa , several hundred million dollars will disappear every year by illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there have joined six countries in 2015 , to the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they now fight illegal fishing , following precisely the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safety is the aim of making even more such initiatives and structures in other regions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s youngest member country Somalia was able to report his first great triumph : in October there was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship which was travelling under a false flag . and not only was the ship used without a license and were not allowed to use towing nets .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ship was also covered in forbidden waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the take of action against Gre@@ ko 1 , they put a strong sign that they proceed against illegal fishing catch , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for F@@ ISH @-@ i this is another success from many . and at the same time , the evidence that works such a collabor@@ ative working way to protect the oceans . Emma Br@@ yce is a freelance journalist and lives in London . she writes on the subject of the environment , technology and nutrition .

after the government of Venezuela &apos;s proposal rejected the opposition of the opposition to a referendum , the Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ ans re@@ acted in their eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country , when they were assembled on the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the back@@ order of Venezuela ) can be found both pictures of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them .
the debate will also be led in other parts of the country - amongst others in the low@@ land Bar@@ inas , in the An@@ des regions Mé@@ rida and T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira , centrally located north of the federal state Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and at Isla Margar@@ ita in the State of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the political and economic situation of the country constantly deteri@@ or@@ ates what is perceived in the everyday life of the Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ ans by a acute lack of food and medicines .
many representatives of the opposition saw the chance of a fundamental change in the office of the current president Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro , but ultimately , the holding of a re @-@ election was blocked by the official authorities .
Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , Contributors at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ izes the context of the government code as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the framework of social , political and economic crisis , the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % for the annual financial statements and in which a serious and far @-@ reaching lack of food and medicine was considered the only way to give the country the chance to reg@@ ain its institutional structures and to complete a new government alliance . &quot; &quot; &quot;

especially big waves beat the message about pol@@ ishing op@@ pression in the central @-@ north of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
the demonstr@@ ators went back to the local cathedral in order to protect themselves according to their own statement before police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government .
hours later they could safely leave the cathedral , but the protests continued .
in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop police forces , including this woman in the An@@ des state T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira :
the women in T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira do not wear skirts , because otherwise you could not see what many nation@@ alities do not have !
meanwhile , an inf@@ ograph@@ ics makes the round that the mag@@ n@@ itude of the op@@ pression per day is constit@@ uted :
thus the dictatorship of the country has supp@@ ressed the country .
many representatives of the government had question@@ ed the validity of the demand for a counter@@ part in question - this was now proven in the eyes of many thousands of people on the road .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others expressed this protests as a further step in the fight against a government that has undertaken little against the devast@@ ating economic crisis and would prefer to make it silent for critical voices : &quot; &quot; &quot;

the interview was translated into English and published here with kind permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to visit the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argentine city Córdoba .
as an adult man , Qui@@ j@@ ano now said within the framework of the Great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process in the province of Cordoba , against his father .
the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , were examined by crimes committed during the Argent@@ in@@ ean military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano did not choose his life .
starting at the brush , the same name as his father carry up to the brutal military operations in La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough .
he kept the family secret for 34 years .
in the situation , I thought that was fine .
I felt like a secret mag@@ ician .
as a child with 15 years you don &apos;t notice that you are manipul@@ ated by his father .
I could not realise that my father was a thief , fol@@ terer and mur@@ derer .
Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie@@ beam@@ ers . during the Argent@@ in@@ ean military dictatorship of 1974 till 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father from 1976 to 1978 was Deputy Commander of the Secret Services Division 141 at La Per@@ la prison .

this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the op@@ press@@ ors who is accused of ab@@ duction in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and ab@@ duction of a 10 year old child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os &apos;s son , a man who had witnessed over the years the mag@@ n@@ itude of atro@@ cities that he had experienced as a boy , and he said before a German court against his own father .
his story shows which great power has a parent about his child and how this child chose a way of salvation .
from the sports hall to the military base
when my father started to take me up to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . there I had been friends with a boy who made martial arts .
they all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father of him and some days later he showed me a black @-@ and @-@ white photo and called me to identify my friend .
he said :
you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you have a friend of ERP .
pass only on that they do not lead you one day , and I will save you .
the abbrevi@@ ation ERP is for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pueb@@ lo , the revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the Revolution@@ ary workers &quot; party in Argentina .
therefore he for@@ b@@ ade me to go back into the sports hall . a few days later he took me to work on the military base .
he told me , I would be a secret .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine . because that &apos;s how my father had moved me .
at the military base , I had to destroy Pap@@ ers who heard the prisoners .
these were all possible documents : university seals , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , prop@@ ag@@ and@@ am@@ at@@ erial , books , just everything .

during the first and last time he left me at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time , he ordered me to get out . he led me to a bar@@ ac@@ ke , in the car , furniture , TV , fri@@ dges - just everything possible .
everything was stolen .
he gave me a small bag wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to bring it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big cl@@ ump of silver .
on that day I went to the other end of Bar@@ ac@@ ke where the stolen items were removed and signed me with a guard .
suddenly he interpreted an open space and said :
the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw in and saw a song that were tor@@ tured on man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it looked like a field bed and metal springs .
later I found out that they secured the end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who was just ch@@ ained .
they rarely cap@@ tiv@@ ate a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs on the bed , shot him with water and pursued a charge of 220 volts to the gen@@ itals .

the sten@@ ch there was app@@ alling ... like a dirty wind .
years later when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came out of his room .
I recognised the smell immediately and I became clear that the smell of a body is in need .
I never forgotten this od@@ or .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I asked myself : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how is it possible that a man can do so much suffering from another ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ I knew that these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me up to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were cap@@ tiv@@ ated with wr@@ inkl@@ es and contributed to the eye .
he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pe@@ z , a civilians who also was indicted in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to cast a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked people lay down with the face down - all were cap@@ tiv@@ ated by hands and feet .
in the vicinity of the entrance people were silent on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father noted that I saw to the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you see , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why have you brought me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were cast into a dit@@ ch and was killed by soldiers .
I know this , because my father told her home .
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms , which were called offices .
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero struck a man there and killed .
( according to figures from the survi@@ vor of the Civil Society , Jorge Rom@@ ero , who also was charged at La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera , was sentenced to death by the students of Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Molina ) .
in the following video , Emi@@ lio F@@ essi@@ a , the director of the La Per@@ la Memorial , is guided by the former fol@@ k@@ chambers .
the way that you came in here is also the way you came here .
if you look at the map , you see that they took about this path and then were tor@@ tured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they got a number assigned as part of the process .
when they survived torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra till the arrangement of the above came that they should be laid .
this was the lie - the Euph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of men and dis@@ appearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; war spo@@ ils &apos;
my father brought all kinds of stolen things home .
at that age , I had no idea what the &quot; war is &quot; - as they called it - was .
but when I was later in the military , I was in G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie - it was clear to me that war spo@@ ils are a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military assault which is one enemy that one fights .

but if you go into a house and the fridge , the turn@@ tables , clothes , paintings , money ... ste@@ als , then that is not a war of war but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
I have always wondered how my father , the leader of the security forces , could join this v@@ and@@ alism .
I just don &apos;t understand it .
I was an officer at the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter into a house and steal .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; once he called me a crimin@@ als , and I answered : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you who asc@@ end on the road ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not crimin@@ als ?
he explo@@ ded with anger , struck me and cried , saying ,
if you go so far , then I will find you and kill you .
we don &apos;t need anyone else !
so my father was .
I have no one good memory of him .
when I said in the trial , I showed a photo of at that time , on which I bore a jacket and a roller pul@@ lover from wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he still brought clothes home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , the defense accused me of being a pity on this crime . I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , no problem , they may lay a burden to me what they wanted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was there anyway to testify .
&apos;@@ The dis@@ appearance of the cor@@ p@@ se is the last horri@@ ble act &apos;
now where I am older , I find repent@@ ance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have children . if you only have children , you recognize the value of a life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one develops and realize that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
well , you ex@@ vi@@ ed during the dictatorship of mankind . but why the bodies disappear ?
why do children kid@@ nap ?
one day my father brought a girl with home , whose mother had been killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl .
I always asked the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ?
they could have simply put them into prison .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people . but why have their bodies disappear ?
were these people not even families , whom could have been given their mort@@ al remains ?
the dis@@ appearance of the cor@@ p@@ se is the last horri@@ ble act that men can do to man .
my father told me when the democracy was re @-@ introduced , they brought machines to eliminate the mort@@ al remains of the prisoners .
they were crushed and disp@@ at@@ ched anywhere - no idea where . &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; said my father .
but anything remains forever .
&apos;@@ i &apos;ve seen how you killed people ! &apos;
only to show it , I have nothing against the military .
I even was at the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just told the truth about 20 crimin@@ als - including my father .
the idea to show my Father arose during a conversation , when he was placed under house arrest .
I made him forward because of all the atro@@ cities that I had to experience him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I have not killed anybody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt in@@ war@@ dly , and asked me why all the over@@ hau@@ led patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which they allegedly defended , were actually good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then I cried :
how can you tell me something ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you committed terrible crimes , and you have comp@@ elled me as a child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he answered only &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I then forgive me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
in 2010 , I re@@ signed the first ad .
I had finally realized that he was a crimin@@ als .
nobody can disc@@ ard me that I was bi@@ ased . I finally told my own father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest still before the end of the trial .
he was charged with 416 off@@ ences : among them severe , illegal de@@ priv@@ ation of freedom in 158 cases , torture in 154 cases , murder in 98 particularly serious cases , torture with subsequent death sequence in five cases and a case of ab@@ duction of a under 10 year child .

the judgments of the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the mag@@ n@@ itude of judgment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historical La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial concluded , due to the crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978 , and finally committed crimes against 7@@ 16 victims in August .
43 subjects were found guilty of crimes against humanity and found guilty of liability for crimes against humanity and sentenced in nine cases of imprisonment between 2 and 14 years . in six cases , there were free practice .
eleven of the originally 54 def@@ endants died during the trial .
# La@@ Per@@ la@@ judgement : murder , torture and rape by counter@@ parts .
all the accused were members of the military , including former military personnel , former police and civilian employees .
Pier@@ o De Mont@@ i was kidn@@ apped together with his pregnant woman in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he taught the following words to the silent chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory conceived by in@@ human heads .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Court of jurisdiction is a historic milestone for all human rights organizations who have spent years of justice for the victims &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , founded in 1995 , founded in the Argent@@ in@@ ean organisation H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , who represents the children of people who were murdered or disappeared during the dictatorship , said :
the trial lasted more than three years but the research lasted 39 years .
in March 2007 , the Argent@@ in@@ ean government handed over the country to La Per@@ la , where there was a memorial to be erected on human rights organizations .

a translation error makes older people in Kyoto to &quot; fear@@ ful driving &quot;
the sign with the translation error to a center in Kyoto , where you can extend its driving licence .
the photo was widespread in the social media .
editing of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese town of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can extend its driving licence in the last month &apos;s witness of a very special translation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on a sign the Japanese word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( co@@ her@@ ons sha ) , which means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mean , but perhaps also with vill@@ ain back@@ ho@@ e &amp; # 8@@ 212 , translated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the false translation was read on electronic ads in the entrance area and building itself from 1 to 20 September .
reproduction of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine , which has been widely shared in social media .
the mistake was Julian Holmes , a resident of Ky@@ oto . he was also attentive to the local newspapers .
the newspaper Kyoto Shim@@ bu@@ n wrote in Kyoto :
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is an ins@@ ult to older people and in an international city like Kyoto just unacceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Holmes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the defective English translation was initially removed . the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more terrible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) was later replaced by the appropriate , although gram@@ m@@ atically not quite correct term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elder drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Kyoto pre@@ fecture has ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation error . furthermore , she explained that the mistake was already included in the text , which they had received from trans@@ lat@@ ors , and that the translation was not checked to their correc@@ t@@ ness before it was published .
a blo@@ gger report as follows the excuse :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are really sorry that older people felt imp@@ acted through the in@@ sufficient correction ( the translation ) on our part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ Cast News was a bit more detailed with the phenomenon of the &quot; fear@@ ful &quot; older drivers in Japan apart and wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was sc@@ and@@ alized as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the proportion of older drivers who are nation@@ ally involved in accidents , but quite a reason to concern . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Kyoto Pre@@ fecture , for example , 1.@@ 9@@ 41 was caused by sen@@ iors in 2005 , representing a share of 10 % in total .
ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors caused 1,@@ 80@@ 3 of total 11.@@ 850 accidents .
this reduces your share to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has fallen in total , the share of sen@@ iors caused accidents in the same period .
the well @-@ called rep@@ orter brought comments on the Yahoo published version of the article comments to light which show the pre@@ judi@@ ces of some Japanese people seem@@ ingly against older drivers :
the article on Yahoo concerning the translation error received the following comments :
- &quot; Is this ( &quot; fear@@ ful driving &quot; ) does not mean the reality ? &quot;
- &quot; So is the translation not really bad , right ? &quot;
- &quot; I don &apos;t think that this is a real translation error . &quot;
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread in Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com website is a real finding of mine for the bizarre mistakes in English .
photo of Flickr users Andrew .
the reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are mani@@ fold .
to translate , you need two important skills : passive language skills , in order to understand the starting text and to send active language skills to avoid it in the target language .
the latter requires the active rule of the target language - something that is in case of mother tongue . in general , the belief that trans@@ lat@@ ors should be in the target language - not in the output language - native language .
this is why a French mother tongue should translate into French from the English language - not from the French to English .
photo of Flickr users Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies employ no staff with English as the native language that could translate translations into English . this may be due to lack of understanding , costs , or the relatively small number of English native speakers that will learn Japanese .
some companies who have no foreign employees , allow translations to be finished . then , the Japanese staff , whose English knowledge is considered the best , is made to trans@@ lat@@ ors - no matter how good or bad his knowledge is really good .
photo of Flickr users Karl Baron .
mach@@ ined translations are also widely used - often with funny results .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the wor@@ rying and en@@ ig@@ matic phrases that by machine translation will show that this technique can still not replace any human trans@@ lat@@ ors . this is especially true for some languages . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the strange English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the pu@@ zz@@ ling prints , often used T @-@ Shirts or bags , are used only for sty@@ list@@ ic reasons - not to be read or even understood .
photo of Flickr user Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors may be acceptable , or at least harmless . but from large companies or from the Government who have the means to ensure higher standards , you can expect more careful translations .
Kyoto will hopefully use a serious source of their translations in the future .
Venezuela : protests and c@@ ens@@ ors take on the internet and television
main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( Free Sur@@ fing ) of the IP@@ YS ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y So@@ c@@ ie@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) .
on Friday , 7 April , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users reported that they had no access to the online broad@@ c@@ aster Viv@@ op@@ lay .
later , other users wrote that Internet presence of V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV are no longer available .
other online broad@@ c@@ aster super@@ vised footage of the protests in Caracas , which were organized by the opposition groups of Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; protests started in early April , after the Supreme Court decided to dissolve the Parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s duties to the executive and the Supreme Court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a Tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection is t@@ apped , and recommended the users to get access to the Internet .
# C@@ ens@@ orship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that Internet websites are closed again on Venezu@@ el@@ an Provider .
this is from the page by @ Viv@@ o@@ Play@@ Net .
offers like Viv@@ op@@ lay are popular among the Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ an@@ ians with internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; traditional media have hes@@ itated by protests since 2014 . at that time the Commission threatened with money and closure , if they continue to report on demonstrations , as the Commission continued this as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; call to violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
without cable TV and informative national television channels , I logged in @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net again .
amazing , that it is still cheaper than buying two litres of li@@ on@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ Sin@@ tro confirmed that not only Viv@@ op@@ lay is un@@ accessible by a blocking of the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two more online broad@@ c@@ aster . this also concerns the website where the National Assembly transfers its sessions .
earlier research of the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that the local internet providers can cause DNS to run DNS . this is a technique that requests concerning the DNS server requests of certain domains .
if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server answers or ref@@ uses the request to call such a website .
we confirm a DNS lock : @ el@@ op oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
in V@@ P@@ IT@@ V , a third locked channel , the transfer took place on Thursday , April 6 , when the V@@ P@@ IT@@ V c@@ amer@@ aman of Elvis Flo@@ res , who recorded protests in Caracas , was put into custody .
Flo@@ res was beaten , while he was in police custody .
he was released eight hours later , and V@@ P@@ IT@@ V went on show again .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , the government has also been sign@@ alled by the government : thus the Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ an@@ ists will keep track of access to multi@@ media coverage of the current events in the country .
in Paraguay , many girls will become a slave to obtain a training
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a Cri@@ ad@@ ita child . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
today Tina fights for the rights of children and collec@@ ts witness statements of other Cri@@ ad@@ itas , which were just like victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated version of a report by Cour@@ ts , which will be published by Global Vo@@ ices with the kind permission of the authors .
the article is part of a series with the title &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , es@@ cu@@ elas que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; F@@ alling cows , Per@@ forming Schools &quot; ) , which is processed and re @-@ published by Global Vo@@ ices .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household , where she did not live together with the family who lived there .
shortly before she graduated from university , she returned to the house and heard the owner of the house full of pride . she said , &quot; She is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they came out of something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old she began to work as Cri@@ ad@@ ita for the family . as Cri@@ ad@@ itas , they are called in Paraguay with more than 46@@ .000 boys and girls who are forced to go to school .
the shop is quite simple : a big family with little money gives her min@@ der@@ son &apos;s son or her min@@ der@@ aged daughter to another , more abundant family . in exchange , the child gets food , an apprentic@@ eship and a roof over the head .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , what is not mentioned here is that the children will have to pay for countless days of house@@ work , which can never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all those in the context of a treaty you can &apos;t raise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this practice , as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go , is widespread in Paraguay , due to the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous dis@@ comfort of human rights organizations .
after completing her studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization dedicated to the rights of boys and girls .
she spoke with Cri@@ ad@@ itas - especially young girls affected by the practice of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected testimony , resear@@ ched and den@@ ounced .
she tried to name things in the name because the feeling of gratitude is vacc@@ inated , guaranteed in general silence .
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is one part , the family that will complete their daughter in the belief that they can complete their training , which can make their position in society and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; something out of itself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to another family . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the family stands up , who just@@ i@@ fies the girl with faith and just@@ i@@ fies her exploitation with faith , who would not give to someone who would not be trained and perhaps even star@@ ved .
the victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
when the girl is har@@ assed , his family will experience only many years later .
sometimes they never learn about it .
in January 2016 the relatively unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the secret in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , was a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ ín came into hospital in Ca@@ ñ@@ az@@ ú , her body showed traces of violent stro@@ kes . soon she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ ad@@ ita in the household of the former military leader Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as a civil servant at the home office .
Mar@@ ín lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ on .
at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ re@@ ira proposed as long as with a stick to Mar@@ ín until they suffered fatal injuries .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later the media reported on the incident .
they stressed that the murdered child was Cri@@ ad@@ ita .
organizations like UNICEF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the deep in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an society rooted practice of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go for the death of the girl .
they marked the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as a modern form of slavery . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; several dozen people came together to protest in protest and demanded that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no other Carolina &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay should be . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl &apos;s name and photos were widely distributed in the social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay , more cows are registered as children , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
without papers , it is much easier to harm the rights of children .
without the official documents it is very difficult to control , under which conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbours of the married and almost 60 civil society organisations demanded an immediate investigation of the fall .
they want Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl who had been sentenced to 30 years in prison .
if the case comes from court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín could be landmark , if the first time in history of Paraguay , a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is coming to court .
the everyday life of a Cri@@ ad@@ ita
the Cri@@ ad@@ itas are not only explo@@ ited as labour forces , they also live isolated from other girls in their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bi@@ k , where her father worked , had to sign bank@@ rupt@@ cy and lost her father .
their brothers , all of them had to work and began to sell on the street or market swe@@ ets to earn money .
but they all went on to school .
only Tina was sent as Cri@@ ad@@ ita into the capital As@@ unci@@ on .
in their employer , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked in between four and six hours every day .
however , she had to divide the time so that you still remained for learning .
she rose up every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared breakfast for their employers .
Fri@@ days , for example , it cleaned the fridge , clean the living room , polished furniture and de@@ f@@ ished the floor .
when the school was finished , she went back home and had time to learn .
the more they had finished with learning , the more leisure it had .
but this time was limited , because they had to make dinner for their employer .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but had not got unlimited eating . &quot; I allowed me to get more books from the landlord as food from the fridge , &quot; she reminds her .
the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a Liber@@ al Party , who was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 .
in some evenings the owner Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , in addition to him and Editorial from opposition newspapers , such as &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pueb@@ lo . &quot;
in doing so , he tried to persu@@ ade them to don@@ ate the reports of the official media about the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he kept them intelligent , but not with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the landlord had found someone who listened to politics while he talked about politics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she didn &apos;t allow me to visit my family , because she was the opinion that I heard there again &quot; bad habits &quot; . so they thought that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a belongs to the indigenous communities of the Guaran@@ í people and would speak at home again their native language Guaran@@ i .
they were afraid that they were the education that she had allowed to lose , she explains .
however , it was completely clear that she had paid for everything she had paid off with her hard work .
also in school Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was also discrimin@@ ated . &quot; one thing about which almost never spoken is mo@@ b@@ bing and the ch@@ ic@@ ans that Cri@@ ad@@ itas are exposed to school when they go to school .
because the other children have parents , they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents , is a Cri@@ ad@@ ita .
I could not invite anyone home to me . I had no friends in school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , at the time where friend@@ ships were created , I felt very clearly that I did not belong to any group .
the isolation was the worst of all , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
the company appro@@ ves the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where you can share job advertis@@ ements and children &apos;s children in Paraguay .
the administ@@ rators of the group is Pep@@ a Kost@@ ian@@ ov@@ sky , a city council in As@@ unci@@ on district .

draft law prescri@@ bes social media in social media to register at the government

&quot; &quot; &quot; sixty Egyptian par@@ liament@@ arians recently voted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the regulation on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regul@@ ating and use of social networks &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he is accepted by Parliament , users must register social media in Egypt at a government agency to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on the law a place would be set up , which is to be commissioned to share the citizens &apos; citizens with permission to share social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
within six months with acceptance of the law , users would have to register with their right names and identity numbers to be able to use social networks .
if it is missed to do this , this could bring a penalty of up to six months in prison or a fine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the bill that consists of six articles and in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt are independent , defines social media as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; jed@@ we@@ de application that runs on the Internet and used to communicate with others by voice , video surveillance and text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is un@@ clear as the law is en@@ forced , as the draft does not constitute an indication of how Egyptian authorities are supposed to be imposed by users who do not make sure that the Egyptian government is currently not able to ensure the regulation on the level of social media companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ri@@ y@@ ad Abdul Satt@@ ar , parliamentary deputy and supporters of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received a username and password &quot; to come through the fire@@ wall to block Facebook . &quot;
it could mean that Egypt plans to establish a fire@@ wall at national level around Facebook . because of those , it would be necessary to submit information about its identity , to access the network .
but it is not known so far that such plans exist .
experts on site are scep@@ tical about the technical fe@@ asi@@ bility of the proposal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ram@@ y R@@ ao@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( German &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Scientific Research Center &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , German &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , Global Vo@@ ices : &quot; &quot; &quot;
I doubt greatly on the technical capacities and understanding of any authority in Egypt related to things that have to do with technology .
in my opinion , they imagine that just as they are ra@@ viol@@ ently control physical public and private spaces it could also be done online .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I take them seriously , this means that they are a powerful surveillance system to filter out citizens who use an approval or not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means a crazy system to monitor the activities of people and also to carry them to a court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is by no means realistic - but in Egypt all is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed in the Legisl@@ ative Assembly and the Constitutional Treaty , before it goes to the plenary debate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether his acceptance and implementation will be successful or not , the draft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is consistent with one pro @-@ military mind in parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ized and ensured that no devi@@ ating nar@@ ration is present on the image area , &quot; says R@@ ao@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; last year , Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed a bill of legislation against cy@@ ber crimin@@ ality , having been found guilty of a life imprisonment for those who found &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; public order &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; protest to protest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

high up in the mountains of the Kurdistan region in the north @-@ east of Ira@@ q@@ is , the veter@@ in@@ arian H@@ ana Ahmed Raz@@ a and her team of scientists of the NGO Nature Iraq have committed to protect the spiritual Leop@@ ards .
a sub@@ type of the bigger family of le@@ op@@ ards ar@@ ches through Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian Leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . they are between 800 and 1,000 animals , such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are due to Wil@@ der@@ ei , the loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat and since they always find less loo@@ t .
why is this certain kind of le@@ op@@ ards so important ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; like Raz@@ a shows in the video &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Persian Leopard is the only remaining rob@@ ber@@ y of the Kurdish ecos@@ ystem &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the health and growth of the ecos@@ ystem also depends on that a large pre@@ dat@@ ory is present . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard really is low and goes towards zero . when the team showed in the video that she showed a recording of a large cat in camera bal@@ es , Raz@@ a breaks out pure joy .
as an educated biolog@@ ist , Raz@@ a passion@@ ately likes a different side of their land , which is not only of war and conflict .
it has been involved in field studies in wild animals and educational programs in Nature Iraq for six years .
since 2013 , she has been a member of IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group and is responsible for making protection zones for wildlife in the Kurdistan region .

in early March 2017 , K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o , the progress made for the nor@@ the@@ astern Japan , K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o , made progress in the last six years , was hit by a massive earthquake , a tsun@@ ami and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hima happened in Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in S@@ end@@ ai , located in the pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ fecture has been in Japan &apos;s north @-@ East pre@@ fecture , which had to live both the earthquake and the resulting tsun@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbor@@ ing cultures Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate were forced , because the tsun@@ ami had van@@ ished all coastal cities from the map .
in addition , the Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ fecture experienced a nuclear accident , already alone 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes .
the special report by K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o shows from local perspective which has been achieved for six years after re@@ build the lives of local people .
the detailed report of the newspaper contains both the statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authority as well as survey results of the concerned itself .
the residential construction in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper reports that in December 2015 , a total of 77 per cent of the planned spare parts ( equi@@ vo@@ cation , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei it@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) were completed in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate .
with the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was reported , 80 percent of the planned spare parts were finished .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hima opened its final light with 70 percent .
nevertheless , one tries to stri@@ ve for six years after the disaster , evacu@@ ated by shel@@ tered shel@@ ters ( bor@@ der@@ ship , cas@@ et@@ su it@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) , in final spare parts .
after the tr@@ ary catastrophe , almost 80 000 people were forced to live in shel@@ tered accommodations .
in December 2016 , there were still 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate in such comfort .
almost 40 percent of the 2011 event evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima still live in not@@ if@@ ications , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was successful on this occasion , more than 75 percent of the evacu@@ ated ones , who had bud@@ get@@ ed after disaster in shel@@ ters , were res@@ ett@@ led in final houses .
for I@@ w@@ ate the number here is 34 percent .
the state of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
like the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , who were affected by mis@@ fortune , opened its doors until December 2016 , which makes up almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later , the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is much more difficult .
while almost 100 percent of fishing har@@ bours in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i have now been in operation , at Fu@@ kus@@ hima only 30 per cent of the fishing har@@ bors have resumed their operation .
the tsun@@ ami and nuclear accident , have severely affected in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agricultural land .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i could re @-@ produce 93 percent of its agricultural areas , with only 66 percent of the agricultural land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed farm@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is unlikely that this is only a result of the nuclear accident , because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed land of Fu@@ kus@@ hima are in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nuclear dispute zone &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has recovered largely back , but again Fu@@ kus@@ hima remains un@@ defeated .
the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are back at 90 percent on the same level as before the mis@@ fortune . Fu@@ kus@@ hima , however , can exhibit here only 75 percent .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper reports that since the disaster almost half of the coastal inhabitants , it is more difficult to earn their li@@ vel@@ ih@@ ood .
is native people prepared for the next big earthquake ?
to determine a total picture , the newspaper introduced numerous surveys under the local population and the evacu@@ ated by . she question@@ ed them about the state of reconstruction and also how their emp@@ athy has changed over the tsun@@ ami risk .
in its introduction of the article , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper explains :
K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o led a survey to bring more about the tsun@@ ami consciousness among the local population in experience .
the survey carried out that 8@@ 3.1 percent of the local habit@@ ants , measures taken to be prepared to be prepared for the future earthquake and tsun@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of respon@@ dents think that there was still not enough to do dis@@ asters in dis@@ asters .
how it stands for those who have to evacu@@ ate from the Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ fecture .
in its issue of the anniversary of the earthquake , K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper has also directed its attention to the situation of evacu@@ ated Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
Fu@@ kus@@ hima did not only have to experience the massive earthquake and devast@@ ating tsun@@ ami , no , the Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ fecture has also been witness of the worst , disaster caused , nuclear accident damaged in Japan .
of 160 000 evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima , nearly 63 000 people were moved in areas outside the pre@@ fecture .
at the beginning of 2016 , some more than 23 000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hima , had been res@@ ett@@ led in permanent spare parts .
after the 2017 stand there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hima outside their home pre@@ fecture .
in the disaster areas , most of the evacu@@ ation areas , which are still more than 50 years old , are known to cause the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hima with massive construction projects . this is a project that will be part of the Olympic Games , which will be held in Tokyo in 2020 .
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when people meet people from other countries , which speak a different language , the differences seem to be larger than the common ones .
however , after a while , one often recogni@@ zes that more than it seems at first sight .
these global connections are important , as they challenge our pre@@ judi@@ ces to extend our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small .
in this sequence of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices pod@@ cast , we look exactly these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep pod@@ cast we treat topics that often get less attention than they deserve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment in which they have felt very strongly linked to someone over voice and country borders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Veron@@ ese Kri@@ kon@@ i talks about the simil@@ ar@@ ities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i Eg@@ her@@ man explains how the love for music has had a lack of common language skills during a trip in rural China . Adri@@ ana Mac@@ ias speaks about the time where she has worked with people from all over the world in London ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back to his experiences that he collected in a small village in Madagascar .

Rei@@ ght : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva on a widespread photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered this week into the intensive care unit : last Friday , a police officer during a demonstration was defeated at Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with a beat stick against the head . nationwide , millions of protest@@ ers participated in a protest march against spar@@ rows .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , studied social sciences at the federal university Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered a skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma and several frac@@ tures .
doctors worked on this Saturday and moved him to an artificial comp@@ el .
its condition is regarded as critical .
the local photo journalist Lu@@ iz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus who spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days .
in the images the face of police officers , too , is to identify with a stroke . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after incident , the military police announced in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had been suspended until the conclusion of the investigation of the active service .
the pictures show the police officers , as he sm@@ ashed in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with his impact on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Luz ) .
if a police officer viol@@ ated a protest@@ ers and land at the intensive care unit , his face would be seen for six months in television and the whole op@@ pression would be justified .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Facebook page &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Des@@ neur@@ aliz@@ ador &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a press channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , shared video on the web , in which one sees how Mat@@ eus attacked by the police officer and several san@@ dier &apos;s shortly after him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
another video with the same scenes , but filmed from another perspective , is also immersed in social networks .
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus the 50th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus who lives in another state , Internet users have donated 10,000 Brazilian Re@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover a part of the cost of medical treatment and to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia while being in the hospital .
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus .

on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for further violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás :
Go@@ dd@@ ás has experienced a wave of political force : here the activ@@ ist Gu@@ il@@ her@@ me Irish was murdered by his father , because he was accused of a occupied school with a gas le@@ ck , and here he was attacked by a police force , who has been attacked by a police force , who has struck him with a stroke .
- Police @-@ gri@@ ps
Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil , where it came to protest@@ ers on Friday last Friday .
police officers were set in protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where protest@@ ers had constructed a stage for speakers , rubber and Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as .
the deputy Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Peace party ( PS@@ OL ) , asked the police via loudspeaker announ@@ cements on violence against protest@@ ers .
this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers throughout the country .
once again , the Brazilian media panels del@@ etes the focus on another , unexpected prot@@ agon@@ ists : a window plate .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo reported specifically on a torn glass window to illustr@@ ate with a photo of illustr@@ ative pages .
on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o preferred a story @-@ story with a built @-@ in bus .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken s@@ wind@@ shield than the protests of thousands of people who serve the defense of a special thing .
you have to recognise that , if one is stri@@ pped against any form of atomic facts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; here too , the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ and@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gets an absurd , un@@ disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ate meaning , and the typical violent acts of military police are covered by head@@ lines with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; protest@@ ers on the fron@@ tier course &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most forgotten villages in Cuba
with the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ var@@ o Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugar tubes made the doors in Cuba ( photo : Julio B@@ atist@@ a ) .
the Pop@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is commonly known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - regardless of its fact that there are no significant sugar harvest@@ ing on the spot .
it is two years ago when the activities were paraly@@ sed in the sugar cane factories .
after the harvest the sugar cane industry stood still in the region , and the factory lost gradually and after its plants until only the framework of steel and concrete remained .
about 272 workers had to invent themselves ane@@ w .
some changed the work .
other re@@ signed and comm@@ ute daily to the factories , which still gr@@ ind .
N@@ ene , a Sol@@ dier &apos;s Day , rising every day at 4 : 00 a.m. , the crisis in the sugar cane processing is not able to sleep its sleep .
he heard that in the east of the sugar cane factories , after a long in@@ active time , they are in operation since they were preserved .
that was something he did not expect .
N@@ ene re@@ members to have heard exactly that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich the su@@ gar@@ cane factory would be preserved , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar cane industry with@@ stood the pl@@ agues , the case of socialism , the low market prices , in@@ efficiency , bad management decisions and climate change .
in 2016 the production was 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the amount produced in 1910 .
the news would have been a motive for some decades ago , but the bad yields already have no more news .
why is the Cuban sugar cane switched off ?
the old train station of the church saw better times .
( photo : Julio B@@ atist@@ a )
the cr@@ ushing of the sugar cane industry was an economical need : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically dep@@ rec@@ ated , and hardly competitive for the country .
the initial idea was to focus the production on the most efficient factories , the annual production target was 4 million tonnes .
they left only the factories left , which can produce sugar for at most 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.0@@ 3 euros ) .
the solution to unemployment ?
the mot@@ if@@ s , which led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the global market .
nevertheless the sugar prices rose again about a decade ago .
from 2017 until 2025 the price of un@@ refined sugar may be between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the 2016 report &quot; Agricultural Per@@ spectives &quot; by the OECD and FAO , Agriculture and Food Organization of the United Nations .
if current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , raw sugar exports would generate roughly 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day will come to history in history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were the first words of Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from then on the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began .
the following years , a total of 98 su@@ gar@@ cane factories , more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for further education .
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on May 14 , 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez worked in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when N@@ ene is known as a soldier , about the closure of the factory speaks , the word he is repe@@ ating most , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sc@@ am &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents are the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
in order to get the place , they formed a full @-@ time working group .
before the first year , the first letters began to come .
it was officially included documents that would only be drawn regarding the parts that would be removed , the address sat and the date .
all were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could appro@@ ve every withdrawal .
by then on , the responsibility was sur@@ passed and the letters were becoming more and more common .
Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the dis@@ continued factory for two years , and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar factory that was still running in operation .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , waits for retirement in another facility , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was against his will at the n@@ ursing office of the factory , whose construction he helped .
with each part he removed , he dismant@@ led one of his 31 years of work .
the most developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important job producers was extingu@@ ished .
in many cases , there were no alternatives for the jobs and services mentioned in the con@@ greg@@ ations where they found themselves .
we will never know if during the mamm@@ oth speech of 21 October 2002 , the then president in the eyes of the present persons saw when he guaranteed to have been running for the areas , whose factories had not run into operation for five years .
the price of the population for the closure of the sugar cane
since 2004 , sugar cane has only been extracted high by mixing .

after two years the congregation of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things are changing , but not always for the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar factory closed , or better said than they began to de@@ pri@@ ate them , they also listened to the road , dis@@ advant@@ aged other establ@@ ishments .
without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look for other factories .
they were shared to spare parts .
without future , many young people left the region as well .
in the area a food factory was created , whose production does not even work for the supply of the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impos@@ ing .
at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene joined the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma back , the ruins of the place where he began to work .
Ne@@ un@@ und forty harvest@@ ing bring the old soldiers a pension of two thousand p@@ es@@ o per month to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich .
Mr N@@ ene , a man of black skin colour , small , with a few teeth and clear voice , is not a gru@@ elling person , yet he gives the lies that told him not .
they tor@@ tured him for ten years .
N@@ ene is about 65 years in pension , not because it is lacking in power but because he is bitter .

young@@ sters of the First Nations communities across Canada deal with topics that are important to them . they do with Hip @-@ Hop , thanks to a number of hiking workshops .
as part of the N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an tour since 2014 , workshop manager mobile cinema leads directly to schools and youth centers to teach youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were guided by the ped@@ agogue David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and worked in North @-@ Quebec with ten Cre@@ e communities and then together with the Cre@@ e Hip Hop Group The Nor@@ th@@ stars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the workshop thus increases the young participants in discussions such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cultural identity , language , meditation , love , self acceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or whatever the purpose . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young@@ sters are the main actors .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the U.S. state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this video of the school &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ yo@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the area of the tribe of the Kit@@ bu@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia tells the story of Highway 16 , also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a street stage in West@@ kan@@ ada , where nearly two dozen most often indigenous young women disappeared or murdered . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cases were largely unknown .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motive of a video game to mediate , such as important the receipt of traditional customs and customs of war , despite the influences of glob@@ alisation .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , though the young@@ sters do not always prevail in the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation has recorded , the refra@@ in will be sung at Cre@@ e .
the young people involved with help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the Nor@@ th@@ stars Hip Hop Group who gave them a verse in the dial@@ ect of Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e .
on the fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ page of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an the verse is available in reverse , as well as a translation into English , which is translated into German :
sometimes I feel like nobody ever interested in myself
but I try to continue my days on Earth
that is the day you &apos;ll take our cry .
because we have lost our way to life in life
but I believe that we will rise a day
I don &apos;t want to see how she lives a bad life
so they can grow and lead our youth as well .
this way , they can do what is meant by the Creator .
in the commentary board the reader and advoc@@ ate of Cre@@ e @-@ Language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au added a post and adds the verse in Sil@@ k ( which is also published on his blog and published here with permission to be published ) :
plastic dishes are not only shown in Japan
plastic dishes ( equi@@ vo@@ cation , cav@@ ities ) outside of typical restaurants in Japan .

in Japan you can see most plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant .
to show potential customers what exactly on the menu stands , will be exhibited close to the entrance of sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( vo@@ icing , &quot; Plast@@ ics Models from the courts &quot; ) , which is served in this restaurant .
the customers see this plastic dishes , and then decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry devoted to the production of this plastic dishes .
in the dead district of K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi there are a lot of these small companies that just produce plastic dishes , produced by the German filmmaker W@@ im Wen@@ ders in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a over 20 years ago .
for most Japanese , these plastic bags are so usually that they are not even more striking . however , a new trend is transformed into current cell phone accessories and other g@@ ad@@ gets .
in Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome , the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i publishes a number of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
now in the special sale : new plastic @-@ made plastic rib@@ bons well as they can be shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
many of these artificial foods have turned to kit@@ sch@@ igen Flat@@ ts , as in this case , fridge mag@@ nets :
here are a few Sho@@ ku@@ go refriger@@ ators for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom of eating positions is increasingly elabor@@ ate .
in this case , an imperi@@ al @-@ don ( a popular rice dish with seafood ) was transformed into a mobile stand .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we have found a good use as a mobile stand .
we also manufactured this part for the Tokyo exhibition at the Tokyo Station .
and here is an Apple containing your mobile phone :
designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design .
and this is just the beginning of a growing flight into the comic .
some mobile phone support and mobile designers allow you to make your own artwork . in this case , ik@@ ura and salmon che@@ ated are used , a popular t@@ opping which is served with white rice .
some users had their doubts on Twitter :
&quot; &quot; &quot; there &apos;s someone who would say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wow , cool , now I can decorate my mobile with laughing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I &apos;ll be the only one .
this interest in plastic dishes can also take less appe@@ ti@@ zing form to surprise for example colleagues or family members .
our latest mobile phone stand has the form of mel@@ t@@ melting ice .
in addition there are also rice balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , earrings and hand@@ y@@ bands from dried salmon .
other sk@@ ur@@ r@@ ile plastic dishes can look at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # 1 .
if you like to learn more about the origin of this trends , then this video gives you an insight into the K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi area , which is dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry . like for example with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually made .
a Mexican project tells stories of the survi@@ vors of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; for the victims of the struggle against drug dealers . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; in reports of domestic and foreign media about the not@@ orious &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fight against drug traff@@ icking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico , the mis@@ chie@@ fs and killed regularly only in statistics . however , they are not reflected in the extent of the human tragedy which brings to this struggle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reporting on drug bos@@ ses like El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the chief of S@@ inal@@ oa cart@@ oons , pushed the stories of the conflict entirely in the background .
on the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the sad@@ ness or communities that have learned to live with pain .
behind every cor@@ p@@ se , behind each bone mar@@ row in the hundreds of secret tom@@ bs , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners , whose wounds might never cure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is why the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico holds the digital project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Apr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir Con El Nar@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; learn with drug traff@@ icking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and telling stories of people who were told in the struggle between prosecution authorities and cart@@ ons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
animal Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project so :
organized crime will not only be afraid of our lives .
the effects are much deeper .
for example , when shops close because they are threatened by drug traff@@ ickers and all communities therefore need to drive many kilometers to buy something like milk .
the pain of the victims
&quot; &quot; &quot; a video entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vi@@ das que cam@@ bian p@@ or el m@@ ie@@ do &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how fear life changed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) tells exactly these stories . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father that seeks out secret tom@@ bs after his son .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ guez , who lost her father only one day , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ phe@@ w .
&quot; &quot; &quot; priests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as every Sunday we prepare ourselves for the task that we have put on getting rid of and after graves , after the people we loved to seek . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric shop in El N@@ aran@@ jo .
on October 13 he left the house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on October 15 , he was to be back again , but he never came back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s very difficult for me , because I &apos;m now alone with three children who need training . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my mother , who is also with me , is also my mother .
at the moment she has no income .
you stand up to my father &apos;s insurance , but she does not pay them out because they require a death certificate .
where should we get ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; Apr@@ ender a vi@@ vir con el nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must not only show the faces of the one who are afraid . we must show the international community to conflicts , frag@@ ility and state leadership . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ HB , a reader of Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the State of Gu@@ err@@ ero , in Central Mexico .
your contribution is remin@@ is@@ cent of us , that you should never consider force to be normal , no matter what form it occurs :
I now know illness and sens@@ ational journ@@ alism now for a few years now .
I pass every day to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks and see the cover pages with pictures which actually only come from a textbook for crimin@@ ology or files from specialists .
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I feel like I am the only one who is stun@@ ned or sad . it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body .
I can &apos;t be in@@ different , or consider it as normal .
she continues writing :
no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old c@@ ousin thinks he wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealers ) if it is big . and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ism &quot; of crimes when they go through the streets .
for me , it &apos;s like those who have lost someone who have lost someone , and those who are afraid that something happens to them as well .
I see our weakness if stories are going to mere numbers in a statist@@ ic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the in@@ som@@ nia of men is incredible to me when death of six people and the dis@@ appearances are justified by 43 students in a neighbor@@ ing place that they &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; disappeared &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think they are trying to agree that they are spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies if they are not stirring and silent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the article &quot; Four months ex@@ tor@@ tion in the main city districts : &quot; in it she describes how armed crimin@@ als were aston@@ ished for month money from their business , until they were not only destroyed by the business , but also their family had torn apart .
you think of everything you lost and remember how some people can completely change your whole life in just a few days .
the pain about it never dies , the trau@@ ma remains , the fear comes back up when you are alone .
habits have changed , phone numbers also .
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the further we are removed , the better .
she completed her report with the words :
we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they are kid@@ ding or kill you .
I asked myself in these aw@@ ful days if weeping would dissolve my deep @-@ root feelings , but the reply is no , because I forgot to live like you we@@ ep . I must learn to live with the pain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the paper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The For@@ gotten Children of Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a Generation of Viol@@ ence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the introduction he raises questions , such as : who cares for the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime ?
how is it to grow in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents take care of them .
Bryan is a f@@ ather@@ less and he tells him to teach himself how to make a egg cook , potatoes , tort@@ illas warm and &quot; ch@@ ichi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for the preparation of the vial with water , sugar and milk powder .
it tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for each year .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ utter@@ able for a boy who consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared .
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood was over two years before , when he was only a few blocks from his home , the bloody body of his father was shot by armed men from a passing car .
when Bryan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this :
Bryan was born in 2006 , when violence was organised by the organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of people according to information of civil security and government of the United States .
in 2010 alone the Public Prosec@@ ution filed 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this corresponds to average 8.5 Mor@@ den per day .
these are just a few hundreds of thousands of stories that organized the organised crime in Mexico and penet@@ rate the country &apos;s soul .
few stories are still living in view of the new head@@ lines . but this project reminds us of those we must not forget .
in addition to the project &quot; Apr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir Con El Nar@@ co &quot; founded the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data in 2015 , its aim is to present the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug traff@@ icking , which has tor@@ tured the country in the last four decades , in understanding a clear@@ ely way .
if a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; from the Flickr user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ ström ( CC @-@ BY @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ ING : this entry and the pages to which it is linked , contain pictures where violence is depicted .
the factor check is important in a moment in which it is about to raise a rum@@ or or un@@ mas@@ ked a f@@ ake .
but how is the years after something the first time di@@ pped ? content in social media , no matter whether true or not true , ten@@ ds to ins@@ ist on .
let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) .
since its first release it was used to be mis@@ leading , carrying out trage@@ dies that actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this false Cou@@ pling of image and event - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; false description &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - deny the fact that there is plenty of me@@ tic@@ ulous about events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it raises questions about our desire for pictures to news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 , a tan@@ ker crossed the place San@@ ge in the east of the DR Congo , ti@@ pped around and explo@@ ded . 230 people died .
after civil war , Africa &apos;s second largest country had been neglec@@ ted and devast@@ ated . the streets in the region became a dangerous p@@ age@@ ant full of impact holes that were difficult to ride .
trag@@ ically , the tank car fell victim to the victim .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; government officials are described a fire@@ ball , the dozens of houses covered , including a cinema in the vicinity , which was full of people who saw the FIFA World Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
houses plast@@ ered and lam@@ inated cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to the in@@ consist@@ ency .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a picture with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from Im@@ g@@ ur users Myst@@ ical Monkey , 12th January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of this day make the dre@@ ad@@ ful scenes of this day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
above is an example of this .
it features rows of wired body which are lined up on the ground while people are watching them .
but here the story does not end its end .
over the years the same picture has been wi@@ ped several times on social media , blogs and other platforms , but may not be attributed to the trage@@ dies in particular events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what and what did not happen in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remot@@ ely Nig@@ erian villages of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
eye witnesses reported dra@@ stically about atro@@ cities before they had to flee .
houses and shops were burnt down , bodies lay in streets and bus@@ hes .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the figures could not be confirmed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one remained behind to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one people to Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many were crushed , shot or burned .
the following periods can only be depicted on the basis of satellite photos .
the occasion of the attack was also un@@ solved , but the military base in Bagh@@ dad was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt to win B@@ oko Har@@ am , a country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here , the picture from the DR Congo appeared again , as proof of the fact and the potential extent of the attack was presented :
that is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days to Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of mis@@ de@@ preci@@ ation and Africa check has documented orders to Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases the image was presented as a cover for measures .
another step further will provide personal comments such as this example wron@@ g@@ ly the picture from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to deliver arguments .
the picture from San@@ ge also occurred in conjunction with the fatal persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a flash , published by the United Nations , those who managed to flee , rape and some dead , some through burning .
while others reported from violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , post@@ s appeared as the following that brought these descriptions with photos from the DR Congo :
this picture was taken by an Saudi @-@ Arab news page , which claimed 2012 that the President My@@ an@@ m@@ ars Th@@ an said , mon@@ ks and politicians would have participated in the assassination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the picture of the DR Congo to address this information .
the original contribution , accessed last on April 26 , 2017 , can be accessed here .
other news organisations , the AF@@ P as their source called , had also attributed to TH@@ A His statement , but had not been associated with the picture from the DR Congo .
the world wide range of false disclos@@ ures
traces of these false need@@ les go back to the years 2011 and 2012 and actually come from all over the world .
with an &quot; reverse image search &quot; you can see how far more information can be exceeded .
an in@@ verse picture search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 3@@ 44 pictures below 18.@@ 8 billion pictures ( as of 3 May 2017 ) 3@@ 44 images , which are very similar to the occupied image from the DR Congo .
they come from a mixed mask private sites , platforms social media , and common publications and are in many different languages like English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have for@@ warded false reports , others tried to un@@ mas@@ ked for@@ g@@ ations .
we have recorded examples of mis@@ use and associated with the respective countries , based on what page it had been published . thus , we want to display the range more clearly than by language only .
the listed countries listed below ( which were connected with each other in some cases ) can be used for mis@@ use .
here some cases that can now be played completely ( on the map in Orange ) :

the orange countries are still available on pages or servers if the examples of counter@@ f@@ eit@@ ing or false not@@ ices are still available .

as a reminder , the source of the picture is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .

this post , set up to members of the Russian Orthodox Church , reveals that the picture of the DR Congo does not show Muslims to kill Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news page claimed that the President of Myanmar Th@@ an has failed to participate in 2012 that mon@@ ks and politicians participated in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the image from San@@ ge .
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this release the picture is still included .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this article from 2014 on students who had been killed by B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; An@@ á@@ l@@ is@@ is Digital &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; news page , has explicitly declared that the image is not taken from the k@@ illings , but it claims that it was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; similar d@@ yst@@ ro@@ dist@@ ic attack &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the painting came into circulation on the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre of 2015 , the newspaper El Pa@@ is attempted to refu@@ te connections to Nigeria .
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ fer@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria , burning the world ) .
the picture of the DR Congo appeared with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , dis@@ b@@ anded a discussion under Muslims after the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 and on Tu@@ esdays at Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted to achieve that their communities were caught up in the Islamic State &apos;s name , a major attention .
United States , 2015 .
the picture was de@@ ath@@ ered as evidence of the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 ( and has more than 9.@@ 300 times ret@@ ched ) , but the messages that were associated with it were not taken up in no religious context .
instead the goal was to pay attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of media coverage in comparison between Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( Vietnamese ) , 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after a message that was allegedly written by a &quot; Father &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ater Juan Carlos Martos &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the Nig@@ erian massac@@ res , there were discussion groups like this one here on Vietnamese and explained it to the wrong track . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the Embassy in which the picture was included from the DR Congo , the organisation of the Clar@@ et@@ ine Mission@@ aries and P@@ ater Juan Carlos Martos .

in all these cases , which appeared only clearly after the original accident of 2010 , the picture may ultimately be a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
frames and pictures
there are two strong subjects or frames ( frames ) that pass through this post@@ s . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photo was used in relation to larger discussions on the silence of Christians through Muslims or - to the defense of Muslims - the mur@@ dering of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hist@@ s .
a second fr@@ aming uses the image to discuss how African life is under@@ valued in comparison to a European or French life .
religion wants to understand and the value of human life is both important . therefore it is worth seeing how images are used in connection with these efforts .
however , a deeper question is , however , what happens if readers may not receive these images any longer .
with social media , there are zig people who have an un@@ inten@@ tional share of having water around a tragedy .
suggests this mood of mis@@ carriage and false information that actual atro@@ cities are in@@ true and sub@@ strate the actual hor@@ ror of what actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the circulation of huge images was already deb@@ ated ( for example ) .
one argument is that the with@@ holding of images of a ref@@ usal to recognize the tragedy . sometimes these images are even demanded by the victims themselves .
at the same time , the concern is that violent pictures readers and viewers can des@@ kt@@ ise their ability to emp@@ athy emp@@ athy ( such as this study , which in@@ sought to work as for@@ cible media , to help others ) .
while there are some more massive represent@@ ations in the news media , fact that it is essential for today &apos;s news coverage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; techn@@ ologists experiment because with algorithms in order to support the fight against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; f@@ ake News &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; you will have to think thorough situation in which a picture has something suggests , but what may be used in the context or completely mis@@ used way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , each examination should be incorrect and should be considered internationally as internationally .

the &quot; Un@@ tran@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog unveiled the Uni@@ qu@@ eness of smaller languages
photographs by Andy Simm@@ ons used in accordance with CC BY @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name Un@@ tran@@ lat@@ able ( i.e. imp@@ ass@@ able ) tries to offer speech enthusiastic a selection of words from all over the world , which are difficult or not to translate at all .
there are such words in any language : they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these irre@@ plac@@ eable words are already well known ( like the famous Portuguese sau@@ da@@ de ) and other rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ bre@@ mes@@ a ) .
but everyone is insist@@ ent on every attempt of a simple translation .
a word or expression is not enough , why a full explanation and sometimes some context are required to understand exactly what is meant with this one word .
these unique words have been collected for a period of time in an online list .
most of these lists deal Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; Un@@ tran@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to concentrate on small languages .
for example , in the blog you can find words from the V@@ anu@@ at@@ u V@@ anu@@ at@@ u .
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Att@@ acks your parents to recognition how to make sure you have tried in your younger years .
and words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language , which are spoken in parts of Brazil , such as :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - The comfort or sl@@ oth@@ ingness that you feel after you have dar@@ ken@@ ed on cold days in the sun . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words about his blog about :
they gr@@ ind other cultures , un@@ veil other thoughts and wake up our curiosity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes you influence how we analyse the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this site want to publish more of this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unnecessary &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; speakers of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Treas@@ ure Languages &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which are very appreciated by Un@@ tran@@ lat@@ able are invited to upload their favorite words here . &quot; &quot; &quot;

how Sri Lanka is to the worst floods of the decade
at the moment Sri Lanka &apos;s island nation is facing the worst floo@@ d@@ - and sli@@ pped catastrophe in this decade .
triggered by the mon@@ soon , usually in late May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , Gin , Nil@@ wal@@ a and Att@@ an@@ ag@@ alu O@@ ya in 15 districts in the south and west of the country have stepped over the bank .
following a statement by the cat@@ astroph@@ ic failure of Sri Lanka in May 28 , 2017 , 126 people were killed and nearly hundred people are missing because of the floods and mud .
more than 400 000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and approximately 100 000 people were placed at 304 safe places .
the rain falls on Saturday ( 27 May ) , and the water stands in some areas went slowly .
health and hygiene limits of the population constitute a massive challenge in the affected areas and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos con@@ vey an impression of the extent of the flood catastrophe :
floods in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water conditions of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am Ame@@ en and Sri Lanka twe@@ et deliver regular updates to flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the catastrophe .
Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly flood tra@@ pped the den@@ gue crisis , save the Children , after further down@@ cases are already on the way .
this morning the Nel@@ u@@ wa bus stood in the high water , water level up to 6 meters . village Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle , also flooded because of the yesterday &apos;s covered water p@@ eg@@ els of the Mor@@ og@@ o@@ da El@@ a .
the Air Force has provided five planes for rescue campaigns and five more are made for transport of emergency deliveries to the residents included in their flooded villages .
different organizations and start@@ ups have also prepared to help .
Facebook pages like Help Flo@@ od V@@ ICT@@ IMS in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information about high water situation and sanitary assistance .
if any search and rescue teams need dr@@ ones for their operations , please call the 07@@ 7@@ 48@@ 44@@ 6@@ 39 number .
for all wanting to don@@ ate dry food@@ stu@@ ffs and vital substances for flood victims -
we are in the area around Kel@@ en@@ i@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call the number 07@@ 77@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 07@@ 77@@ 84@@ 38@@ 41 if animals need help in this field .
the taxi company Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their location data with the help of the app so that the Cat@@ ast@@ oph@@ enz@@ entrum is informed .
last year after the catastrophe of the Trop@@ ical River Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me introduced a &quot; high @-@ water aid &quot; key to call it users , a vehicle to pick up assistance from assistance and donations . these were then for@@ warded to the sr@@ il@@ ank@@ ic Red Cross .
&quot; &quot; &quot; similarly , they led a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SOS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button to initi@@ ate more than thousand requests and 150 successful bo@@ oting actions for flood and low @-@ driven people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the united efforts by the government and the civil population of Sri Lanka , where several social media platforms are fully exhausted , residents will bring in need in need of security and help assistance to help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this has prevented the loss of further human lives , but the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way to rest@@ oring norm@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot;

if approved in January , I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and love friend .
I trust her four years old daughter , she tru@@ sts me her children ; she is my rock in the surf .
in one minute we call for the rights of women .
in the next morning we conclude rights for trans@@ gender .
we are in a sea of umbre@@ llas and humans , some keep the iconic image of a woman with head@@ scarf highly , bound from an American flag , others so@@ res por@@ ol@@ ises against Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my girlfriend looks at me and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; These things are not concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslims ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already led this conversation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people with whom I work or people who have met me for years , separate me - the Sah@@ ar they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslims &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which has built up in their concept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they gra@@ b@@ ade me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we don &apos;t see all the same .
we practice our religion differently .
we identify ourselves to be Muslim , in different species . but somehow we are all put into the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is well constructed in our collective concept that as soon as Muslims , who do not fit there , become de@@ pressed .
threat@@ ening to become de@@ cip@@ ated
I don &apos;t stand alone .
that even happened to the poet whose poetry is most sold in America : Rum@@ i .
which images come to mind when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
when J@@ al@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Kor@@ an and Prophet Muhammad , were up to the day when he died , the center of poetry .
but religion is er@@ ron@@ ed in the western idea , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry .
this del@@ e@@ tion makes a large proportion of the history of 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another consists of the reduction images of Muslims who have been colon@@ izing Western books for centuries .
this entic@@ ing picture language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
the ground@@ breaking Palestinian scientist Edward Said broke down the history behind these paintings in the 1970s .
but these paintings still contribute further today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continues to deep@@ en them .
I worked for thir@@ teen years in the news industry and I have seen how this powerful , fla@@ wed fo@@ ols domin@@ ate our news@@ feeds .
this nar@@ rative is sh@@ ad@@ owed the reality that during the last three decades , nine Muslim women have lead their countries , while the United States could not even choose their first female Presi@@ dential candidate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this nar@@ rative fails to recognise that if French , Muslim women are forced to carry their head@@ scarf in public buildings and to cover su@@ di @-@ Arabic , Muslim women through their government to cover their entire body , both sides of the same coin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a powerful group practices its &quot; control &quot; to the &quot; others . &quot;
this strong nar@@ rative weak@@ ens Muslim women , which lead movements to change .
it looks over that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil from Afri@@ kan@@ ers , who had been brought to bondage under bondage .
it del@@ etes the existence of Que@@ er @-@ Muslims .
this nar@@ rative has seized our collective imagination , that often S@@ ik@@ h men and children become anti @-@ tim@@ eli@@ ac attacks and ch@@ ic@@ an@@ ings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because of those stories we tell , and because of the kind in which we tell it , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not only fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to 1.7 billion dollars
in the news industry , we do more than just tell stories that are based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create fo@@ ols , who help us understand the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and my industry failed to failed to capture the nar@@ rative of 1.7 billion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims represent the highest degree of &quot; diverse &quot; religious group in America .
more than one third of the whole Muslim population is African @-@ sto@@ cky Americans .
six of the ten American Muslims are among the immigrants of the first generation that come from 77 countries .

four decades ago , my immig@@ rated parents came to New York to live their American dream .
my mother put her first jewellery design in 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American st@@ atics from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
at that time , when Khan had re@@ designed the Sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were un@@ disp@@ utable Muslims and Americans .
but am I now inde@@ xed Muslim and American ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , when people ask me why I don &apos;t have pork meat , I say - instead of getting my Muslim recipes , or do my hand@@ ker@@ chie@@ v@@ an who bear all Muslims in themselves - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; respect for Pep@@ pa W@@ utz &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am jo@@ king , we don &apos;t carry all the bags with us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we must also be no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or to be selected by almost always for additional security checks at the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim schol@@ ars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists who try to fight widespread lies about Islam .
these lies are produced on the running band of a well @-@ lubri@@ cated Islam@@ ists , think tanks and experts for Fal@@ sch@@ ise , which is our already fla@@ wed picture of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the stories we tell , and because of the kind in which we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is ri@@ pped in more than just a stranger who breaks the head@@ scarf . &quot; &quot; &quot;

I want to explain that .
I was born as a Muslim but I was born in my imagination as I was four years old when I was four years old , in a provisional mosque in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
when social scientists describe religious life , they attack the following terms : believe , behavior and eth@@ nic@@ ity .
my Muslim faith and behavior may not always be visible , but they are there .
maybe my girlfriend would see my neighbour , my rock in the surf , that I could see the Muslim when it could look through the 15 meters concrete and air that separate our houses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she would see the end@@ ab@@ end@@ able ritual with my daughter when I kept them in my arms and their Arab verses have to protect against the Kor@@ an and called the Q@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
each of them I repeat three times .
I ask that it is protected from evil , evil that you can see and the evil one cannot see .
my Muslim faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim membership is always part of my shadow .

eth@@ nic@@ ity is the picture of my grandmother &apos;s mother@@ ly part with her sisters , as they win a competition of the art of Flowers in Kar@@ achi in decades ago .
it &apos;s the picture of her that I &apos;ll see my eyes : Nano , surrounded by their finished and un@@ finished paintings of Su@@ fi @-@ Holy ; and one Kor@@ an with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters , which can be used almost by heart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim means to speak the prayers , which they told me , if I have a bad day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be Muslims , as she taught me to teach me in God : Allah M@@ ian , what God means , my only Lord .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a nation that has been colon@@ ized by an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Empire &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Imperi@@ um &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which has established a company with the name of hon@@ orable British eastern Ukraine , it has a deep meaning to call God my only Lord . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the author 1987 with her grandfather .
use approved .
eth@@ nic@@ ity means to grow and hear that men don &apos;t we@@ ep , but at the same time that my dar@@ ken@@ ed grandfather cri@@ es .
in the meantime , while he writes books on the modern Islam and about the independence K@@ ash@@ mir , N@@ ana Ja@@ an illeg@@ ally vent@@ ured his family in India , who ruled that he was not allowed to close his arms in a half century .
belonging to know that there are millions of Kurds and Palest@@ inians , whose families , as with my grandfather , have been torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists , which have divided the Muslim world as at stake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the past two centuries , Muslims have to know that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; colonial countries have all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; colon@@ ized in the last two centuries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it means to know that the first Fli@@ eg@@ erb@@ om@@ be was rejected by a century ago over a Muslim country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , an intimate , k@@ ash@@ mir of the British Empire , was referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dangerous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the newspapers of his time as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dangerous &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even before there were air@@ planes , he travelled to more parts of the world when I ever was and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to my Muslim tribe of 1,7 billion people , we go deep into our unforgettable family trees ; our un@@ plugged story . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it means to remember that four years ago , the most powerful military in the world , with troops that were spread over every continent apart from Antarc@@ tica was to pursue mass destruction of weapons that did not exist .
it means to know that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is buried under the ruins of war .
an American Muslims means to know that the suicide rate of veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
it means to know that if a tragedy bears the USA and the susp@@ ects a Muslim name is telling the story four times more than a story with a white assass@@ in .
it means to know that four hundred years ago the first prayer call , Az@@ aan , was called Bil@@ al by a free black slaves .
it means to know that two hundred years ago an African Islam@@ ist named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ l@@ aved and brought into this country .
it means Mal@@ col@@ m X to call an American hero .
it &apos;s the warmth that I feel when people crowded the airports to fight against Muslim Ban .
it is hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams , and if we speak black life .
an American woman , a Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ erin , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ ab@@ i , a Muslim and a journalist signi@@ fies the inher@@ ent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our ident@@ ities , but to fail to fail them to others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the nar@@ rative of 1.7 billion is more possibilities than a magic cube , but is represented in the reduced branch &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be a mother means to care for my child and all the Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged people can build up structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia is in the Muslim regist@@ rar that began with President Bush and has been wi@@ dened by President Obama .
it is in continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
she is in the immig@@ rant worker who takes a five @-@ year old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it is in a country that surro@@ unds its borders against people from just the countries that bom@@ bed it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no @-@ Fly list &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which largely accepts Arab and Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are the wars which we lead and bombs , which we reject on Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because of the stories we tell and due to those who do not tell , we are here today .
in a study with the title Asc@@ ent of Man , scientists of the Nor@@ th@@ western University found a scientifically correct picture and asked them to assess groups on a scale from 1 to 100 in terms of evolution .
Muslims received the lowest score .
the conversation , which we have to lead
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are too deep to have gu@@ ised the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will be back for decades to recognize the roots of our fears , and the error and dangerous figur@@ ator that we deep@@ en in our news editors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least , there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims in the media industry , which tries to capture our many ident@@ ities and obli@@ vi@@ on history .
the pod@@ cast Lake Some@@ thing , Say Some@@ thing of Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the pod@@ cast lots of Muslims ; Sap@@ el@@ o Square on black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Sch@@ ust@@ er Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative to im@@ print the Muslim writers and Ms Mar@@ vel , the PA@@ K@@ IST@@ AN@@ IS@@ CH , Muslim , American Super@@ hel@@ din - all of this makes me hope .

and that moment has consequences which go beyond the 1.7 billion .
there is a reason that conspi@@ racy the@@ or@@ ists exist , which existed in the dark corners of the Internet , now bring the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they have grown exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is another group that has grown exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally by which it has created &quot; others . &quot;
it had not yet been given a few years before , now they have major areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am concerned about real@@ ities and history , which I was not aware of when I was so old now , as it is now my daughter , but who made me today to an in@@ bound Muslim .
things I left here like a bread@@ crum@@ bling track in my speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; things that may wake up memories , as in all the inter@@ sections that make our hum@@ ank@@ ind may listen to a story , where someone is doing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
right now , on the other hand of the bridge in Berkeley , convers@@ ations took place in the framework of the 8th Annual Meeting of Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
more than a hundred ac@@ adem@@ ics talk about our problems with the &quot; others , &quot; structural rac@@ ism and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot;

we all need to ask ourselves why ?
why do I tell that here at this T@@ ED@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward Said , the man who showed us like wars , and people through the work of the &quot; others &quot; in public presentation had been enth@@ r@@ alled by the public performance for four decades ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have to put ourselves un@@ comfortable questions after the role of him , consci@@ ously and un@@ consci@@ ously the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which we have a new future , in which we don &apos;t have a new future , while he already won well @-@ known countries and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people , far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it begins with all of us .
initiative for nar@@ rator wants to preserve urban language variety
stor@@ y@@ telling stories by Flickr users Daniele Rossi , using the license CC BY @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be a possibility , here and now , despite a language barrier to contact someone ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Perry , founder of the initiative Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) is a possible answer to stories in their original language .
global Vo@@ ices told you recently about another initiative by Steven Bird , the in@@ audi@@ ble blog .
however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written word , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to obtain and dig@@ ni@@ fy the language variety of major cities .
in fact , in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin , Australia , or in O@@ ak@@ land , in the United States , where T@@ LS has already carried out events since 2015 , the risk that small and not quite so small languages were not given to the new@@ born children .
for the project makers :
mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided if we have to establish the cities - secure spaces , in which inhabitants must not forget who they are to be added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while listening often is often associated with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to understand these events instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to listen to feeling , to make . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format , hist@@ y@@ t@@ ellers show their story in their own language before and translate , or explain them in English .
although the participants are not a professional t@@ ellers , their dev@@ otion and presentation carry on it .
they call to laugh and emotion when the language is no longer a barrier .
the following video shows , for example , a traditional story from Burkina Faso , which is told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the stor@@ y@@ t@@ ellers of Ras@@ si@@ dat@@ ou won the opportunity to explain the most typical of her country .
in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the be@@ ak of the bun@@ ny and the P@@ avi@@ an in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
&quot; &quot; &quot; after expl@@ aining the meaning of his parable , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is asked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How is it to speak to a public which does not understand your language ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he shares his sense of inclusion : &quot; &quot; &quot;
you have listened !
they were attentive ...
they were all with me !
so far the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities , and the organiz@@ ers hope to expand this . all those who are inspired by the project can get in touch with T@@ LS in order to organize their own skills .

&quot; &quot; &quot; proclaimed by the group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ ud@@ ad@@ ano p@@ or la Audit@@ or@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( citizen front for the neur@@ ons of debts ) and the Ö@@ kom@@ en@@ ical Assembly of Puerto Rico . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the advoc@@ ate of the debts of the debt have also submitted a pet@@ ition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is their demand :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people of Puerto R@@ ican demands that politicians , bank@@ ers and government agencies , are responsible for the debts to their corruption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for financial inspection and a management committee without personal interests in public debts , with a firm , our working conditions related re@@ mun@@ eration in favor of the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are pressed and supp@@ ressed .
the people of Puerto Rico is ref@@ using to pay a debt that is not thei@@ rs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pension@@ ers will not be found with sin@@ king pension payments .
we demand immediate measures .
the island - not in the state of states integrated in the USA - suff@@ ers from a serious financial crisis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Centre for New Economy &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; an independent non @-@ profit organization with no focus on soci@@ o@@ economic development , a law for state responsibility , as an alternative to the existing state supervision . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are its reasons :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Rico requires long restructuring of state infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
measures imposed on the outside are without the participation and convic@@ tion of citizens risk to be rejected by the people .
the demonstration was named &quot; Last &quot; for Light and Truth . &quot;
here are some impressions :

the Syrian @-@ Palestinian web developer Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bas@@ sel Saf@@ adi , will be missing for a year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives continue the campaign for his freedom and remind of the posts that he did for an open network .
this year &apos;s re : public@@ a , the annual conference on the digital culture , hosted in Berlin , dedicated to the event of the # Free@@ Bas@@ sel campaign .
Mé@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist of the France @-@ based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , Managing Director of Book Spr@@ ints , a publisher of the book cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive In@@ dies ( The Cost of Freedom : a collective research ) .
the book that was published last year and licensed here , contains a number of approaches to deal with free culture in the face of op@@ pression .
it is a homage to Bas@@ sel and his work .
in the introduction it is called :
this book wants to rev@@ ise how movements for free knowledge are being built and what are true costs , with whom these are connected .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researcher and authors who have participated in the movements for free knowledge , have side on page to look over the fog that surro@@ unds our news@@ feeds and create something sense of our various experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteers who has been detained in Syria since March 15 , 2012 .
his name was painted from the directory of the A@@ dra prison , in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015 .
since then we have no information about his current state or residence .
the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice that would push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom .
to see how Bas@@ sel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us begin to reflect on their own dest@@ in@@ ies , actions and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what did we choose ?
what have we given up extreme beliefs in this process ?
the developer of Open Source and digital activ@@ ist has been in custody for Syrian government agencies since March 2012 .
in October 2015 , Bas@@ sel was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military facility to an unknown place .
his wife , the writer and lawyer , N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi , reported that the &quot; Military Police Bas@@ sel was based on a &quot; strictly secret &quot; recorded command of the military court of his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
G@@ ha@@ zi reported that she was cont@@ acted by persons on 12 November 2015 , engaged himself as in@@ sider of the Assad government and put them into knowledge by an alleged death sentence against her husband .
his where@@ ab@@ outs and condition remain unknown .
a pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bas@@ sel plays a crucial role in spreading access to the Internet and to the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and currently passes the director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that formed Bas@@ sel , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book :
maybe none of Basel &apos;s cultural prototypes were pro@@ spective as the work that he started to re@@ design with a group of ar@@ che@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to re@@ design the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ra .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the way@@ cross of numerous civilians and here mer@@ ging Greek @-@ Roman architecture with hi@@ es@@ igen traditions and personal influences .
Bas@@ sel was not able to know that ten years after he began working with this work , the IS would put all this architecture , which em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world .
this strip to the digital Archae@@ ology and the preserv@@ ation has created a time cartridge that will be inv@@ alu@@ able to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future of inv@@ alu@@ able value .
trag@@ ically , Bas@@ sel could not conclude this project yet .
N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in jail :
I have spent my whole life , dre@@ aming of freedom and who taught me to embrace her .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bas@@ sel gave me English , even when he was already detained .
I learned to read , write and speak English .
he always shared his knowledge with anyone who asked him . he has taught others to read , write and speak English .
Bas@@ sel has opened the gate to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he taught me the internet .
he also taught other in@@ mates , as they use computer , at least theore@@ tically without having actually held a hand in her hands .
G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Warten auf ) , a proxy , which she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 when he was detained .
Bas@@ sel and N@@ oura worked together for one year along the book .
they s@@ mu@@ g@@ gled the lyrics to him , when she visited him and he translated them from the Arab to English .

it happens during each visit ,
that I sank in the world of your ench@@ anting eyes ,
that I lose the reflection in the moment in which we embrace ,
that each of the dangers are no matter ,
each of the f@@ ences , fet@@ ters and guards
I forget the thr@@ ott@@ le of the prison .
and I penet@@ rate every detail of your voice and words
which I carry with passion for me ,
if your eyes say Le@@ aving
and I leave another piece of my soul with you ...
I quickly return to my lon@@ el@@ iness ,
to get back all the moments ,
and to smile and smile on your absence .
I bear witness myself that I will return soon ...

Basel &apos;s history is not unique in Syria .
since the beginning of the protests against Bash@@ ar al @-@ Ass@@ ads , the Syrian network for Human Rights ( Syrian network for human rights ) have disappeared over 65@@ ,000 people .
those who were arrested or executed under violence by the regime , were tor@@ tured or executed by the regime .
until 2016 , according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International had died at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians in prison since 2011 .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of Bas@@ sel since 2012 .
today , we repeat our demand in hope we have to do this for the last time .
Mos@@ ambique : sentenced for corruption on previous post due to corruption .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mozambique responded with anger over a corruption incident where a government member returned to the workplace after half of his sentence at the state of the state , where corruption was committed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is what Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza , who was arrested in 2008 and in 2010 together with four other def@@ endants , was sentenced to 22 years in prison , with four other def@@ endants .
the money was from public funds from Mozambique airports , whose Council was headed by Cam@@ b@@ aza between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ b@@ aza was released in 2016 for a good lead and immediately called for his return to the company , which occurred on April 19 , then .
in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , who decided to apply the request , there would be no obst@@ acle to Cam@@ b@@ aza , as the company had no discipline in his detention .
however , many residents are not doing the action good .
the centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Inte@@ gri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , short C@@ IP ) , a local institution which advoc@@ ates for public transparency , sentenced in an interview with the Deutsche Welle , the decision of the company to restore the director again :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poses a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and clari@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a reg@@ ression regarding the efforts of our legal system , such as the C@@ IP . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what we have to know is that the company should have introduced a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; disciplinary method against the revers@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the company apparently failed and promp@@ ted any reasonable legal steps for applying the respective functions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Muslim social media , re@@ jects this behavior also and consider the case as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ref@@ usal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Cam@@ b@@ aza would be a competent guy , he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of them had lunch .
he could have paid lectures and motiv@@ ating words , he could advise and pol@@ ishing his image .
but as he is in@@ competent , he has approved to be re@@ integrated into the company , which he helped to add damage .
therefore , it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ aza would like to be paid for his silence .
contradic@@ tory !
bitter Vi@@ age , Young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil says of no moral question :
Cam@@ b@@ aza is rewarded by the state , because he ob@@ jected him , I can &apos;t believe that someone has made someone so massive already .
Cam@@ b@@ aza l@@ acks mor@@ ality to return and serve the state , * he already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead he only served by the state .
Cam@@ b@@ aza used the state , as trade , it is an in@@ exhau@@ st@@ ible money source and the state itself has become tired of this man who was finally charged and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence .
hon@@ estly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te pre@@ fers to recall the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , to recall that a thief belongs to the prison :
Th@@ ie@@ ves belong to the Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el prison not only to remain as the first independent president in memory but also as a sharp , one @-@ door and - prophe@@ tic speakers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one of his most famous oral represent@@ ations , as he was energetic , confirmed that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a more ambitious person is able to sell his amb@@ itions for his amb@@ itions to sell his own individual interest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sam@@ ora also said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that it is not so . he changes the tac@@ tic , but he does not turn away from his amb@@ itions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a more ambitious man is criminal . &quot;
in Twitter , reactions were also le@@ aning :
Cam@@ b@@ aza was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he sat 10 years and came free .
and today the company deals with which he will make money from a de@@ file , again under contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ OM@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - on Friday ( @ az@@ mal _ Raf@@ ik ) May 12 , 2017

Facebook is blocking the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cen@@ sored many users
the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means chick@@ pe@@ as or spi@@ der @-@ fin .

according to data from Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took their postcards from the net because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although the origin of the word is still being deb@@ ated , it is usually used to refer to humans East Indian origin or generally used as an ad@@ jective . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook cen@@ sored the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of foreign language in Burma in the social network . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alistic movements has given the word an extremely difficult con@@ notation .
in particular , it is a word that mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims who represent a minority of population in Myanmar .
but in the efforts to combat hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cen@@ sored a lot of vol@@ umin@@ ous content on its platform .
indeed , &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; may normally be associated with rac@@ ism , but the word on itself doesn &apos;t automatically call H@@ ass@@ pron@@ unci@@ ation .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that also post@@ s in which they have discussed the use of the word , or in doubt about his use have been expressed , cen@@ sored .
beyond that there are several bur@@ ial words with different mean@@ ings , which have the same character sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , the chair is written to Bur@@ m@@ ese too &apos; Kal@@ ar ht@@ a@@ ing &apos; which contains the same letters as also other words such as &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( Sp@@ age b@@ se ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ at &apos; ( cham@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ar@@ k@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ g@@ gering A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; :
a post of my friends was deleted today , because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he asked his friends in a spiritual way , whether they would like to alle@@ vi@@ ate his back pain by making a word game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the set ku la - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - similar to the rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
Z@@ in Win H@@ ats is the opinion that they may decrease H@@ ass@@ pron@@ unci@@ ation of radical nation@@ alists , though it also stressed that Facebook analyses down all the post@@ s that spread in the suspicion of rac@@ ism .
Facebook del@@ etes the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; manually .
it is fil@@ tering the word automatically .
the automation will not understand what you write to fac@@ be@@ ook .
what it should be done instead , to analyse the mail carefully and check it by checking the words of the words .
for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; ( Sp@@ age b@@ sen ) .
the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists who spread the h@@ ass@@ pron@@ unci@@ ation are a pretty good lesson .
now it is time to circumc@@ ise its nation@@ alism .
while the action may send a strong signal to all the hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not pers@@ ist long .
the experiences of social networks in China like S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have shown that the c@@ ens@@ orship is often a cat and mouse game , where users can simply use social networks to express a new word or an alternative writing of the cen@@ sored word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook started to delete his post@@ s when he just wanted to inform his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; is ban@@ ished from social network :
... when I was aware of this new directive on Facebook , I made a post to share my Facebook friends that the word is locked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; ir@@ on@@ ically , my post of Facebook was removed and I prohibited the li@@ ken , post and share of content for 24 hours because the post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Facebook Community &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was not un@@ answered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Facebook has a lot of postcards from people who have no negative inten@@ tions or they simply try to show their opinions about the nation@@ alists .
Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed , who has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
in the post , the author shared his opinion about why extreme Nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad .
Chan My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have said before the start of the initiative more , for example , the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet Community asked for advice :
Facebook might have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce rac@@ ism in Burma by their platform , but it does not work .
such words can only add more hatred within the different communities .
in addition , it appears as if they have started without local context or technical support and have been forbidden as &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; inheritance cur@@ ry . &quot;
even when they found out that they have made mistakes , they did not temp@@ t the fal@@ si@@ fied posts .
if they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits , which gave them a great turnover , that would be great .
Fac@@ ebooks automatic c@@ ens@@ orship has provided for much ri@@ dic@@ ule among the users .
rather than take it seriously , users now make fun and write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate speech to see if their post@@ s are taken from the net .
here you can see some screen@@ shots from Facebook post@@ s that have no h@@ ass@@ pron@@ unci@@ ation , but nevertheless removed :
with permission used .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text is &quot; I want to sit on a chair and watch pe@@ as cur@@ ry and watch a Indian film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; just to try out whether Facebook is the mail that contains the word Kal@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot , with permission used .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Post says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , do you cure people ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot , with permission used .
in the past five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists who have used social networks to extend their voices and their influence .
among other things , H@@ ass@@ pron@@ unci@@ ation in social networks will also heat the violence in the con@@ greg@@ ations in Myanmar , especially in the area Rak@@ h@@ ine , where disputes between Muslims and Budd@@ hist@@ s have forced thousands to flee .
for his failure , Facebook has been critic@@ ised for his bur@@ ners , critic@@ ises his bur@@ ial pages under control .
but rather than simply use the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better , rather than in context than on code concentr@@ ating initiatives and learned from them .
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tobago is over with the children &apos;s before
a wedding ring in sand .

the inf@@ ant before is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago .
on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament of the country unanim@@ ously approved a law to offer this practice , so that the age of marriage is now 18 .
prior to this change of the marriage there were some members of Hindu and Muslim religious communities in practice , and in May 2016 , the leaders of the Inter@@ religious Organization ( IR@@ O ) , a group , gathered in a group of representatives of the various religious groups of the country , that the state should not inter@@ fere in the country , since that , age did not bri@@ des the maturity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was un@@ aware of the fact that Trinidad and Tobago is a contrac@@ ted partner of the UN Children &apos;s Convention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; min@@ ors , every man under 18 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children who had been married to 15 percent , in Trinidad and Tobago grew 2.8 percent , and with 18 were there 8.1 percent .
in 2011 , the country &apos;s statistical central office confirmed that between 1997 and 2007 , more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married at 19 .
online pet@@ itions and social media movements that were ende@@ avo@@ red to abol@@ ish laws for children &apos;s before , followed at the foot and rejo@@ iced great support . no doubt helped them to bring this result .
nevertheless , not everything went smoothly .
a Hindu guide , for example , had no concerns to say the critics of the children &apos;s before , they should take care of their own affairs . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of religious opposition was a complicated thing for ten@@ sions in this fact , and some doubt came into doubt whether the opposition would agree to the bill . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but early in 2017 , the bill was decided against the children &apos;s before - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of opposition and an independent who contained themselves , so he could be discussed under the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now only the President of the country must agree and proc@@ laim the law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the country &apos;s Sen@@ ators issued a status update , which has posted the Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ agram :
Mr. Clar@@ ence R@@ amb@@ har@@ at : the bill of bill Against Child Care was approved in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives with 35 votes and no one else decided against it .
after having decided before in the Senate , the draft must now become a law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the majority of social media users were enth@@ r@@ alled because the laws of the children &apos;s before were finally changed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , who dressed in the Ministry of Education , said :
it has too much time and unnecessary talk is needed , but you know what ? the child &apos;s before is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago , and this is nearly worth every price .
while Abel Jackson was the opinion it was definitely long enough to abol@@ ish the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was happy that the day has finally arrived :
public status update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which says : News , Excell@@ ent news !
the law is approved .
minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for it - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , who belong to Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society which was right openly about how important the adoption of the law was noticed :
the age @-@ related age in Trinidad and Tobago is independent of the religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
the amend@@ ment to the Act was adopted today , on 9 June 2017 .
in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives there are 41 members and 35 of them were present in the vote .
all members , who were opposed , voted for the law .
the inf@@ ant before is not allowed in Trinidad and Tobago to law .
it was a long battle ( ... ) # and mar@@ ri@@ age@@ isch@@ abuse .
many thanks to all the activists who fo@@ aled him .
congratulations .
a thank you to our members .
however , a possible hit@@ ch comes in the form of Sat Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary General of the San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hindu organization of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; months ago Mahar@@ aj has announced his intention to take criminal steps , should the law be adopted , and he seems to rede@@ em his promise now . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the general public prosec@@ utor Paris Al @-@ wi , a advoc@@ ate of the law said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Mahar@@ aj was strug@@ gling against the law , most social media users wish to change the debate else . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Patricia Wor@@ rell proposed :
dear Sat , if we , instead of talking about the discussion so much , in a way that only panic and dis@@ grace , we would like to mention the state in our bedroom , that they may be mis@@ used in our bedroom , that they may be ab@@ used to them &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; would you be ready to continue the discussion ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
or do you think it is not a problem ?
but if it comes to a judicial proceedings against the law or not , this legislation is an important step , but there are still places around the world where the children are legal or remain legal , although there are laws which they are under@@ going .

although Turkey has been closed by Wikipedia since 2008 , as recently published in an published report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ings of the Internet since 2007 , after the Internet Act ( No. 56@@ 51 ) has been adopted .
to China , Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to massive c@@ ens@@ orship from Wikipedia .
while the platform remains closed , there are now several Mir@@ r@@ or@@ ations pages ( pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and frequently be updated ) .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform placed all Turkish Wikipedia sites on its dedicated pe@@ er @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network ( i.e. calcul@@ ator software connections ) , which does not make up a complete c@@ ens@@ orship in the system of domain names .
the content is however call@@ able despite legal prohibition .
in a blo@@ g@@ post , IP@@ FS report about his efforts :
after we have heard the messages ( about the lock of Wikipedia ) , we have all done snapshots from Wikipedia on the IP@@ FS platform . thus , the possibility of reading the contents on dec@@ entr@@ alized and distributed ways .
this can help users to view at least all Wikipedia contents , even if you can &apos;t access the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.org itself .
IP@@ FS also announced that this step was conducted independently of the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it only deals with screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wik@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent the lock .
Crist@@ ian Con@@ son@@ ni from Wik@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ cyclo@@ pe@@ .org , a Mir@@ r@@ or@@ Side of Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that everyone can use to host similar mirrors , if placed in the country of Wikipedia .

it is not a complete copy of a proxy address , a mirror .
one is access@@ ing another URL , which is not the original . that which one sees is from Wikipedia .
essentially , the server leads the request to the right Wikipedia page , so that it is possible to see the content from Wikipedia , if they are locked in Turkey .
for this is executed by a server which is not in Turkey .
a Nep@@ alese wildlife photographer uses his camera to attract attention to the need for nature conservation .

photo by Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
used with permission .
Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was with the photos that he looked around around , never satisfied . they were bl@@ ur@@ red with badly positioned mot@@ if@@ s and well @-@ washed colors .
that motivated him to wear a camera , and try to handle the situation .
back then he was a child .
today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar stri@@ ves to bring Nep@@ alese to the international stage .
and his native town directly next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offering him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that move the attention to Nep@@ alese wildlife .
he described on Facebook as this first @-@ class situation in his work helps :
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! !
I just rested from home when I had called Navar@@ aj ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) . he had received a call from my father , that a le@@ op@@ ard was on the banks of the Rap@@ ti river .
the river dam@@ m is only a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river where the le@@ op@@ ard was , and I immediately began to cra@@ ck@@ le pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar stri@@ ves to achieve a collaboration with the authorities to gain global recognition for Nep@@ als nature and would like to deep@@ en understanding that wild animals are not so fur@@ ious , as they look like .
and he should know it because he was standing up to face to face from face to face :
a tiger does not distur@@ b the sheep &apos;s opinion ! !
late evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
even I was there because of the darkness on the way home , when suddenly the king of the book appeared . he immediately shows us and he star@@ es at the Sal trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar placed the logo &quot; I click for Conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos .
his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ als nature and wild animals is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days and mostly lived in a tent to take pictures of Ot@@ ter . up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist information .
see below some of these photos .

years after the wedding there is Indian women to speak their hus@@ bands on behalf of their hus@@ bands .
women in the small Indian village of Gum@@ la Jam Gay@@ i in J@@ har@@ k@@ hand .

this post was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and was originally published on video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community organization from India .
a revised version was once again published as part of an content @-@ sharing agreement .
in many parts of India there are women with the greatest care to speak the names of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
instead , use a g@@ onom@@ ers or say &quot; father &apos;s father . &quot;
from Ch@@ hatt@@ is@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h , women give women to respect the husband &apos;s social pressure , as well as the fear of the consequences they should dis@@ regard the norm in life .
last year Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was convicted of the Indian State of O@@ ost@@ a and thrown by a family and the village community after having called a married relatives with names .
the tradition of her wives likewise does not give them name , is also common among men . however , they have far less subsi@@ dence to fear , if at all , they should not follow this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health professionals and house@@ wives , were thus quickly leading to the city &apos;s leading plac@@ ard theme .
it is a place just for them alone , where they can discuss and discuss the delic@@ ac@@ ies of Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
as one of 56 clubs , which exists in 13 indi@@ an states , he is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al which is operated by the community video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and is set up for the degra@@ dation of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ist has been working for seven years with the help of her vide@@ oc@@ amera , such as children &apos;s marriage to the exile of H@@ IV@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected , and heads these clubs .
it reports about how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time they have made amb@@ ass@@ esses of the change .
the first video that Roh@@ ini showed in their discussion round , did women who call their hus@@ bands on behalf .
she chose this subject , because she wanted to open the talk about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem with which women can identify easily .
the names of their hus@@ bands do not speak lou@@ dly , is a custom to keep them guilty and never question@@ ed .
Roh@@ ini means :
this tradition witnessed that a wife respected her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not agree , is regarded as a cra@@ f@@ ist , as a woman without moral .
the tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this discussion round .
at the beginning Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband so far , wanted to try out at home , as it runs .
she showed the video of the discussion round of her husband and mother in law .
Roh@@ ini tells :
my mother in law and my husband still weigh out long after the video was at the end .
Pra@@ k@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said , I should call him from now on his name .
with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage Roh@@ ini started her first discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before . some believed that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women would be protected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem at U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection , women tried to put discussion with an exercise .
Roh@@ ini asked every participant to tell her husband &apos;s name - happy , upset , sad , loving and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then asked them all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If we can &apos;t tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us how they want us to respect us ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
should it not be equivalent ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day to whom they brought the name of their hus@@ bands on her lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ist from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra on the Bre@@ ast of a century tradition , in whom women have never married the name of their hus@@ bands .
Roh@@ ini tells :
a woman was so shy , that during the whole practice , a woman decided to leave his own fru@@ stration against him and his family by taking him away .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
even in the adren@@ alin rush to have broken with an old custom , the women decided that they would actually try to call their hus@@ bands on behalf .
and they held their word .
in the coming days Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas they put into the head : his wife couldn &apos;t stop saying his name .
another club member decided to do it for dinner before the whole family .
when her mother @-@ mother she star@@ ed , she was afraid , and said that it was a mistake .
another woman said , &quot; Roh@@ ini said , I should do it . &quot;
a husband of participants was less understanding and the situation art@@ ed in violence .
Roh@@ ini reports how women tried to stop other practices , such as wearing a chin @-@ red point on the forehead , which indicates the sp@@ ouses :
why must only women show that they are married ?
I said to my husband , that I would bear the chin @-@ off point if he did .
he only laughed and I listened to wear it .
the other women didn &apos;t stop completely because they think they are now in a better position to choose , not to carry him on some days .
for many women , the discussion cul@@ lu@@ b is a secure place where they can exchange their opinions and goals .
&quot; we are doing an excursion at every discussion group .
normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want the women to make sure what could hear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
during the last months she celebrated her own birth@@ days with cake ; she danced and sang about things about which they had never thought about .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have said about some things , for example , how our ident@@ ities are knot@@ ted to our hus@@ bands , never to be honest .
it feels great to say certain things to say , no matter how small they occur .
in a discussion round we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected with clothes .
some women in the group have only taken sar@@ is for their marriage .
for most of them it is okay , but some wanted a Sal@@ man @-@ Kur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a pants , wear ; they have not clo@@ aked .
after much stri@@ fe and discussion about the advantages of their own clothing , mor@@ als connected with the Sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ g@@ gel@@ te Roh@@ ini their own pair of courses ( Ober@@ shirts ) in a discussion round so that women were able to carry them .
next , they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a where they can wear je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is sure that they will create it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the question is whether in the five months since their first discussion cul@@ lu@@ b has changed somewhat , Roh@@ ini confirms that things come slowly into the roles : &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have only made small steps so far . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some women tast@@ ed it a few times , but then they listened to saying their husband &apos;s name .
some , including me , do it , but only if they are alone and no other family members are involved .
only one or two continue to say the names of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now wear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red at their fore@@ heads .
the women in a discussion lu@@ b know that changes that they want to achieve in their lives - like feeling of freedom of movement or their own clothes @-@ choice - at the end of a hard to navigate river .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each one of us is a sacrifice of patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am it too .
but this club gives us confidence that something will change .
and I know that there is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction if any woman dies home in the club and other people talk about what we talk about and what we do .
we all sit in the same boat .

the first Japan visit to the popular band The Beatles is celebrated with a memorial day .
the Beatles began their landing in Japan .
screen@@ shot of the official YouTube channel of the Beatles .
on 29 June this year , the H@@ ash@@ tag was the War of War ( The Beatles Day ) in the Japanese Twitter trend , with which many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beatles .
the visit of the Beatles in 1966 in Japan is considered the turn@@ around in the Japanese culture of the post @-@ war period .
the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ iko , who was inter@@ viewed in London in 1964 , on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the first visit :
for just barely five days the Beatles have been in the country , but this was enough to rotate the Japanese .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; man here is quite quick to realise that they had no other election when Beatles began receiving open arms . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many famous Japanese sizes had reached their zen@@ ith when the Beatles came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the music of the cult band is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ry@@ u@@ ichi Is@@ aka , President of the retail price Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ kei Asian Review . &quot; &quot; &quot;
good morning ! the Today is the Beatles Day @-@ Day in Japan . they were 51 years ago in Tokyo .
even today , songs of the Beatles have sung in Japanese kar@@ aoke @-@ bars and in English classes on Japanese mid @-@ schools .
the Beatles have survived all things .
today , The Beatles Day is commemor@@ ative .
we all love the Beatles in our house .
I don &apos;t know if this &quot; W@@ inn@@ ie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; doll John Lenn@@ on should be portra@@ yed or not .
and as for fans , Japanese do of course also make pilgri@@ m@@ ages to the well known places that are related to the band .
when you love The Beatles , these are your 5 places you must have to visit .
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Ma@@ thew Street ( in Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fields ( memorial in New York )
4 ) P@@ enny Lane
5 . ( From the Link ) The Beatles Story ( Museum ) , Liverpool
the pilgri@@ m@@ ages can sometimes not be sc@@ ur@@ r@@ ile enough :
good morning together .
today , The Beatles Day is commemor@@ ative .
exactly today in 1966 the Beatles came to Japan for the first time .
the characters from the film K @-@ On ! did a pilgrimage to London and ran across the Abbey Road .
we did the same last year .
and of course some companies also use the fan base , such as this R@@ amen Shop ( R@@ amen are Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo .
good morning , here is Mut@@ ah@@ iro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen ! the Today is the Beatles Day .
and what could that be for a day ?
I will listen to myself &quot; Y@@ EST@@ ER@@ DA@@ Y &quot; and eat the R@@ amen pasta with Mut@@ aro Ko@@ ya .
so the day is going to go today .
so , we hope you are doing it !

a new system of ab@@ duction of gl@@ az@@ ed persons for organ traff@@ icking , probably for super@@ st@@ itious purposes , wor@@ rying the police of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government now called a number of operations into life to stop the practice .
at the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometers from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims had been found and part of the organs were taken from .
two men were arrested and subsequently reported that the organs of sh@@ am@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi are used .
the local super@@ st@@ ition on the local super@@ st@@ ition that the head of a man &apos;s person could bring gold , or wealth , declared the police pre@@ acher from Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia to the BBC .
it is the first time that succ@@ essive attacks have been registered on scrat@@ ches heads in Mozambique .
another group that is the aim of these ven@@ ial purposes is people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to the UN to investig@@ ate a mission in the South African country to investig@@ ate this practice .
the persecution of people with Al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of Southern Africa , especially in neighbouring Tanzania where the government campaigns to fight these super@@ st@@ ition and pre@@ judi@@ ces .

two susp@@ ects were arrested in the milit@@ ant district , where the mur@@ ders were arrested .
Hus@@ sen@@ e Alg@@ y Ad@@ amo , student and residents of the town of In@@ ham@@ b@@ ane in the south of Mozambique said that the local police are already following :
PR@@ M believes that the sh@@ am@@ ans are involved in the death of smo@@ other men .
the persecution and killing of fl@@ ared individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the District of Mor@@ avi@@ bal@@ a , has given cultural motives and is considered by the traditional sh@@ am@@ ans into consideration ( PR@@ M ) , which also indicates that a belief can exist , according to which the victims might have power , the wealth of wealth .
in recent days , three men with hair failure were murdered in this part of the country .
Angela Fer@@ re@@ ira Sam@@ an@@ tha shared the chron@@ icle of the blo@@ gger poor Sn@@ ai@@ ppa , who interpreted that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty in which Mozambique is facing :

despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomena , some of the opportunity for mak@@ es@@ ing humor settled down .

a photograph by Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Liu X@@ ia , which was probably first made recently .
this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the fall of Chinese dis@@ si@@ dents Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has drawn attention to the international community , after his lawyer was announced at the end of June that he had been hosp@@ itali@@ zed for liver canc@@ ers in the hospital .
in 2009 , Liu was sentenced to eleven years &quot; imprisonment for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( state of state ) after having engaged in the draft of the Charter , a manifest@@ o which calls for democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China has referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an internal matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and nar@@ rated a speaker , he considered it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yet China continues to get calls from the international community to allow Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate and his wife , poet Liu X@@ ia , to allow him to offer a treatment abroad .
while some countries critic@@ ised the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are completely exhausted .
Hong Kong Free Press has summar@@ ized some reactions from abroad .
United Nations
Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the High Commissioner of the United Nations for Human Rights , met at the end of June Chinese officials to discuss the case of Liu .
however , a speaker refused to comment whether the United Nations should ex@@ ert pressure to make Liu abroad a treatment .
Norway
Norway &apos;s Minister of Ministers in Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Minister of Foreign Affairs B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende have refused to answer questions about Li@@ us &apos;s liberation .
the relationship between China and Norway fell into the stores after the Nobel Peace Prize awarded to Liu in 2010 , although the Norwegian Government agreed to do nothing with the decision .
diplomatic relations were only continued until December last year . in June , Norway signed an agreement to return the salmon to China , since its exports were mostly blocked since 2010 .
after the news spread that Liu was seriously ill , the Nobel committee brought his hope for a un@@ conditional release and invited Liu to withdraw his prize in Oslo .
because of his imprisonment , he was not able to pay his price .
Liu was represented by an empty chair during the ceremony .
European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament passed a resolution on which China was promp@@ ted to free Liu and his wife immediately from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support , where he wants .
the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mog@@ her@@ ini , also called for the release of Li@@ us , as she announced in a statement on 30 June :
we expect China to raise all restrictions from Mr. Li@@ us wife , as well as family members .
they should meet and receive all visits , who wish them to be able to communicate and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
USA
&quot; &quot; &quot; U.S. Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad told us that Americans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wish him that he has the possibility to treat the treatment abroad , in that case it may be instrumental in his satisfaction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a female speaker in the US Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the news agency AF@@ P on June 27 that the Embassy decided to free the Chinese authorities , not only Liu free but also his wife Liu X@@ ia put from her house arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the invitation from the US Embassy moved a fur@@ ious response from China to the utter@@ ance of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no country has the right to inter@@ fere and ir@@ responsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pol@@ ley told that China should offer the following :
protection and freedom , such as travel speech and access to the medical care of his choice , which they claim according to Chinese constitution and legal system and international obligations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the U.S. Sen@@ ators &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and Ted Cruz also introduced a decision in the Congress to push the Chinese government on it to release Liu and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I urge China to un@@ condition@@ ally release the Nobel Prize winner # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o so that he can occur in proper medical treatment . htt@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German government spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin that Liu &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has given all the medical support he needed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanitarian solution for Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chinese President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping appeared on July 7 and 8 at the G20 summit in Hamburg .
previously reported diplomatic sources in Beijing the news agency Reuters , China had great concerns whether the vor@@ tex could be sh@@ ad@@ owed by Liu &apos;s visit to Hamburg .
Canada
on 28 June , the Canadian Ambassador , John Mc@@ Call@@ um , called for China to provide an appropriate medical care , and to give him the opportunity to provide himself with his family .
Li@@ us lawyer told AF@@ P earlier that Li@@ us Ms. Liu X@@ ia could visit him every day but the police always admitted the room in the hospital , and that Liu is not allowed to talk with someone outside , including his attor@@ neys , to speak and contact .
Mc@@ Call@@ um continues to tell :
Canada calls on China to maintain its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , maintaining the rights of the rights reserved for the exercise of these rights .
France
France &apos;s foreign affairs urged China to release Liu out of humanitarian reasons on 29 June :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all treatments which he , regardless where , needs . furthermore his wife and his family have to contact him .
although the news channel France Info told that the French government would welcome Liu in the country , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there will be no further information out if France will eventually take him .
Taiwan
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of the land@@ land@@ ings in Taiwan called on 27 June on Tuesday to release Liu and deplo@@ y a greater tolerance towards those who want peaceful funds to challenge political reforms and democratic development . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legisl@@ ator Yu Me@@ i @-@ nu from the ruling Democratic Fort@@ ress Party called on to allow the ill @-@ intellectual Liu to treat yourself in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , showed himself in a statement on 28 June by Liu very worried and gave to that many have asked him to pray for Li@@ us well @-@ being .
he said about Liu :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is my faith , that the initiatives that he took and was strictly punished to a harmonious , more stable and wealthy China , which in turn would have contributed to a peaceful world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I personally felt very moved and encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellec@@ tu@@ als and affected citizens , inspired by Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , the Charter 08 signed , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?

is Singapore a city or a country ?
the question may seem stupid , as Singapore is recognized as an independent state .
but according to the Minister of Justice , K. Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am , Singapore should be considered a city .
this remark has triggered a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the Bar Association in New York , the Minister found that many people critic@@ ised the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because they were compared to Singapore with other countries .
it supports Singapore to be considered as a city .
... no one has question@@ ed whether New York is a democracy ...
that &apos;s it , with most people a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blog Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io accused the Minister of Justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; turning the logic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then , after all our efforts and efforts to create this valuable land , we can say that we have no country .
it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of a flight before the responsibilities , a bre@@ ach of bre@@ ach .
Singapore , if you are not my country , whose country is it ?
the reasons made by Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am were not very no@@ bel : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , given that he was inev@@ it@@ ably un@@ democratic .
on the other hand , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities like Chicago , San Francisco or New York , alike cities which are run permanently from a party .
these cities are democratic .
as soon as you reach the core point of the subject , the good old bodies of the author@@ itarian leaders , which pret@@ end Democrats , leave the dist@@ orted logic , as it fits better to their power .
in the last week of Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am the answers were given to its American guests regarding our press , our Jewish philosophy , our political system really non @-@ answers .
he put appropriate questions with non @-@ responses a r@@ ational way .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls for Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am to understand his opinion since she did not understand this conclusion .
personally I find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
if Singapore is not a country but a city , so to which country is our city ...
in short , I don &apos;t understand anything .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would be very grateful if our dear K Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am would accept the effort to elu@@ ci@@ date this point , so far as he was paid to be part of the Government of Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by announ@@ cing on his comment on the blog , he suggests that it should begin to read the entire writing of the conference , so that in the context of the testim@@ onies of Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am could better understand , according to Singapore , a city , and no country .
read the address .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore was rather a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; than a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained why elections in Singapore would be so ung@@ od@@ ly important , even if we are looking forward to free and fair elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he compared Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of those cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be no country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he obviously didn &apos;t mean it in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cle@@ ment T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment of Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am , who as leader of a growing generation , makes such a pol@@ em@@ ic statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am above what the justice minister of Singapore has said very much ... &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Ye@@ w and the members of the old gar@@ de what awaits me - I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s a different thing .
but with K. Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am , member of the new generation of the political leader of Singapore , I have doubts and I am not sure if he really believes it is really associated and aware of what he def@@ ends .
the T@@ EM@@ AS@@ EK Review comp@@ utes the vulner@@ abilities of Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ ams Arg@@ uments :
did Mr. Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am &quot; ben@@ evol@@ ent a mistake , &quot; or was it a Fre@@ ud@@ scher Lo@@ ad ?
if Singapore is not a country , we are considered an independent and so@@ vereign state ?
if not , in which country are the so@@ vereign rights of the city of Singapore back ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally land and city .
because he plays an important role within the government office , the testim@@ onies of Mr. Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am are of significant importance .
why do the Singap@@ ure take their military service , but defend their city only their country ?
who must pay back our Prime Minister ?
what is the value of our pink personnel ?
are we the citizens of a country or residents of a city ?
the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade to affir@@ mation , Singapore is and was always a city :
&quot; I did not say what I said ... &quot;
this pack seems to have been anno@@ yed by many Singap@@ our ...
no one has ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island nation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defense of the country above all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; etc. but this is not entirely correct . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should rather speak of the defense of the city .
the myth of the &quot; nice Canadian &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Flanders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices asked recently his editors : what is the aspect of the most ab@@ bi@@ ous aspect about your homeland or homeland ?
their answers are published here as part of a continuous series , exposed to rum@@ ors of certain parts of the world and a different fac@@ et should be shown .
the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thompson , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
the question that is being question@@ ed to me in Japan is : &quot; are you American ? &quot;
&quot; no , do me harm , &quot; I reply . &quot; I &apos;m from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I live and again in Japan .
depending on what situation the talk takes place , it is considered polite to show interest in his talk partner by asking personal questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my clari@@ fication follows mostly the default response : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice @-@ hockey , nature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many Can@@ adi@@ ans may cook together with anger , if they are kept for Americans , but does not b@@ other me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for someone who doesn &apos;t know , there is little that differs from Americans from Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Can@@ adi@@ ans get a Canadian banner clearly visible on her ru@@ cksack when travelling .
everyone love Can@@ adi@@ ans .
Americans by contrast ... .
so it was already when I started travelling the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before 11 September .
Canadian has always carried small map@@ le leaves on their baggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free health care !
there are no weapons with us !
same sex riages are legal in Canada since 2005 !
everybody seems to think , Canada is so great .
we are polite .
we obviously say very often &quot; sorry . &quot;
Canada is supp@@ os@@ edly considered as the most toler@@ able land opposite ethnic groups .
we are not as these types south of the border .
we Canadian are nice .
I hate this .
first , I have many American friends who I admire very much .
there would be nothing to me , if you would be confused with Johnny from Dallas for example .
Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
there are some problems with the stamp &quot; nice . &quot;
first , as a &quot; nice &quot; means to be bl@@ amed - like goo@@ ey , gentle but trag@@ ically un@@ important figure N@@ ed Flanders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has an own Canadian Doppel@@ gänger ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if Canada really is a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flanders , that would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem exists that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has no personality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are no edges and edges , nothing in which you can cast off .
being harmless , is to be un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive and in@@ interesting and not making attention .
this can be something good , if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , remot@@ ely from things that happen around one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would even go far as far as to say that the desire to be free and alone , a chief of the Canadian . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we tend to take care of our own business .
what out@@ sider is considered &quot; nice &quot; perhaps just cool courtesy .
Can@@ adi@@ ans don &apos;t talk about the fence across the fence .
we l@@ acks warm heart@@ y , open kindness , which I connect with my American friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; luckily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) Justin Tru@@ de@@ au entered the stage to show that Can@@ adi@@ ans are more than just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; our prime minister has made Canada sexy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
music video of a pop @-@ band par@@ o@@ ert Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
one in Thailand famous pop @-@ band has released a music video , which seized the jun@@ ta in 2014 and re@@ construc@@ ting the government in spite of their promises to restore civil government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) is the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who talks about which rules his girlfriend . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although not expressly political , the music video refers to the ongoing military domin@@ ance of the jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video to the song was a huge success .
within the first three days only the video was shared on Facebook and received 8,@@ 800 L@@ ikes on Facebook .
&quot; &quot; &quot; last month the Charlie Chap@@ lin @-@ Video &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Der dict@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists interested in the public to watch this video . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , as it is concerned with the situation of the country under the jun@@ ta rule . &quot; &quot; &quot;
have a look at these photos of the videos which relate to some of the political issues , which Thailand has persist@@ ed in the past three years .
the &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; may possibly refer to the dra@@ stic section 44 of the preliminary constitution , given to the commander of the host absolute decision on major national topics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 11th rule : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change your attitude &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; imagination &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people who are regarded as critics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the image above reflects the introduction of the law on computer criminal , whose v@@ age and un@@ clear rules are often explo@@ ited by the authorities to make activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit in the army has also been set up , the online content is monitored and persons accused of being s@@ lander , prosec@@ ut@@ ally pursued the monarchy .
Thailand uses a strict face against &quot; read Maj@@ est &quot; ( Maj@@ esty of honour ) .
on 20 May 2014 the martial law was proclaimed in Thailand .
two days later it came to a coup of the army .
one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to buy , is its decision to buy expensive U @-@ boats , although security experts they warned that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax v@@ eins .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the video will even be shown how people will be thrown into a black delivery v@@ ans before they get into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; some journalists sit in prison because they rep@@ or@@ tedly have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confusion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in society and Internet users will pun@@ ish long prison sentences , they should besie@@ ge the monarchy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the te@@ aser of the songs of the band played the Sal@@ ut from &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em &quot; which was already used by Put@@ sch opponents during the 2014 protests .
life goes on to the ruins of the Gei@@ ster@@ cities in eastern Asia

the following article written by Dmit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ no@@ v , was first published on the website of OC Media and published here with kind permission .
post @-@ war society is re@@ covering only very slowly in East @-@ East Asia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
it has now passed over 20 years since the waste @-@ off @-@ ab@@ as@@ ian war has been officially ended , but his scars are still visible in this part of the republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show distinctive pictures .
villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ kh@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ ava are located in the car@@ park of Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , ab@@ as@@ ies , Geor@@ gian and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together in Soviet times in the area .
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
today , the largest region of Russians and Ab@@ ch@@ ases are living in the area .
such sett@@ lements are also called spirits in Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
in the pre @-@ war period , more than 10,000 people lived here , and there are only a few hundred people in these v@@ ets .
this phenomenon is characteristic for an@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of the district reached 16@@ ,000 people , after having hardly ever increased over a decade .
in 1989 , approximately 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this district .

&quot; all this is a consequence of the war &quot;
the empty five @-@ story blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 60s , called Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ t@@ schu@@ k@@ ow@@ kas are symbo@@ lically called for the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are exp@@ ire and rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native older man .
he starts a conversation and it &apos;s hard to finish this .
&quot; all this is a consequence of war . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why don &apos;t I talk ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is still unique . &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
there were community centers , schools and nur@@ ser@@ y schools served by the community .
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded spl@@ end@@ or buildings .
people who once lived in this place and had their contribution to the central plan of the Soviet Union , have meanwhile abandoned the district .
about fifty inhabitants live in the ghost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ che@@ v &apos;s , which can accommodate one or two families , one can recognize on the balconies , where laundry is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed home .
when they discover me with the camera in the hand , they immediately withdraw .
&quot; our mother has forbidden us to photograph us , &quot; says one of the girls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is forbidden to us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers her friend something and suddenly they leave the destroyed buildings and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the persist@@ ence industry ( cultivation of agricultural products for the own needs ) such as livestock breeding , bee@@ keeping and vegetable farming .
it &apos;s difficult to get over the laps .
the District Court supplies free candles and bread on the villages in winter .

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build cour@@ get@@ tes &quot;
about ten years ago , an older woman with@@ drew the name Gal@@ ina ( or T@@ ante G@@ ur , as it is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite her el@@ dest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina did not leave Ab@@ ch@@ asia to live with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my heart will remain forever in Ab@@ ch@@ as@@ ies , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she tells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gal@@ ina wants to accept no financial help from her daughter and insist@@ ed that she supports her young grand@@ son instead .
Gal@@ inas monthly r@@ ents are just nine dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
aun@@ t G@@ ett tells you that they and other vill@@ agers try to meet regularly and holidays together .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman and a young family and I live in this building .
when holidays are , we visit ourselves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but we cannot do this constantly - everybody is busy with his own problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while she tells her story , a younger neighbor appears on the balcony .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; call@@ eth her for her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said we could build cour@@ get@@ tes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already prepared the floor .
I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build cour@@ get@@ tes . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ as interview partner Nat@@ ascha has lived together with her husband and the five joint children in their home for a few days .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day she reminds itself of the village life before the war .
despite the relatives who live in central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country Ab@@ ch@@ asia left off ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave .

&quot; we recently bought land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative district in Ab@@ ch@@ asia ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build a house there , but it will last something &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ ascha is awarded $ 9 for every child .
her husband works in the cab@@ bage .
the young family has its own farm .
near the house , where Nat@@ asha &apos;s kinder@@ garten was once found , they keep pigs , cows , h@@ ows and chickens .
it tells you it was a very wor@@ rying situation , when many people left the village after the war .
but over time she lost her fears .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark street or a few people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
it actually has something to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war there was little work , and all lived as it was right .
I remember every day as the city and the war were once . &quot;
when our conversation ten@@ ds to the end , a little boy is running past us .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hides .
a ball flies from the window and another boy hun@@ ts him back .
he plays with the ball , which then desc@@ ends the hill .
a group of children now pursu@@ ing the ball .
while they run , some of them cast stones to the abandoned building .
these ruins are part of her childhood who care for integrity in their lives .
you don &apos;t know it any other way .

in Mexico , &quot; Mama Africa &quot; houses migrants in their long journey
Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez runs a small hotel in Tap@@ h@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border of Mexico to Guatemala .

this article by Amy Bra@@ cken was published on April 19 , 2017 on the website of our partner PR@@ I.@@ org and published here with friendly permission .
on the way to the migrants which cross Europe or Latin America , certain places will be known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he is located at the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel close to the city centre .
it is managed by a 59@@ - year @-@ old Mexican , a small woman with a coral pink Br@@ illen@@ Chassis and golden earrings in te@@ ddy bears .
she &apos;s called Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was raised in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and still know them many under the name Mama Africa .
this nickname is the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a target for Afri@@ cans and Ha@@ iti@@ ans that are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
for about 2,50 dollars the night sleep in simple rooms , with bare , ab@@ ra@@ cking walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ r@@ ots in a cage .
there is no sign@@ post to the hotel - however , hundreds of African and Ha@@ iti@@ an migrants are coming here .
sometimes Mrs Ram@@ í@@ rez tells , people arrive in full mini@@ buses and from the upper part of the coast to call it : &quot; Mama Africa !
where are you M@@ um from Africa ? &quot;
at the moment , it is rather quiet but in this year Ram@@ í@@ rez has already welcomed 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have also slept outside on cardboard boxes .
she wants to refuse anyone .
she also helps them and bring them to the hospital when they are sick , she buys them medication that they can &apos;t pay , they mas@@ ked them with a bal@@ m that used the long journey .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebast@@ i@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived at a short time ago .
I asked him if Mama Africa was a reasonable nickname for Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the Sebast@@ i@@ ao family ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a yogh@@ urt ) pos@@ ing with Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : Amy Bra@@ cken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel that it suits her because African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebast@@ i@@ ao travels with his sister , she hopes to come to Boston to find her husband and the three children .
you have lived in Brazil , however , it is for some Afri@@ cans that are on the way to the United States to make normal one first stop in South America and then move towards north .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the family had heard of other tours of Mama Africa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he tells us that the Ha@@ iti@@ ans and Afri@@ cans are often travelling together and that Afri@@ cans are already speaking to W@@ hat@@ s@@ App from Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
like many of his companion , Michel@@ et has lived in Brazil before and worked as building worker for construction sites of the Olympic Games and FIFA World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy is weaker , he started its journey into the United States .
he has been a guest in Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the Bu@@ st@@ ic@@ ket to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he will contact Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let them go again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered smiling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells you to send her guests often text messages when they continue to gr@@ ate them or to report their journey over the course of their journey .
it explains that their Christian faith is the drive of their labour .
she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests taught her to prepare chicken like in Ghana .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known , but she is not the only spar@@ ks hope for the migrants who go through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family mig@@ rated to migrants in their small house .
he is a polic@@ eman and has found that the Bu@@ st@@ ick@@ ets are sold too expensive to numerous African immigrants .
he has begun to help them a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for one dollar the night .
at the moment 25 people are there , mainly Ha@@ iti@@ ans .
some sleep on the ground , but at least they have electricity , washing machine and cooking .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests are through .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have lived in the United States , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he tells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have experienced what they are experiencing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others do not help . that &apos;s why I give them my support . &quot;
after he lived for three years , he was referred to a raid on his work office out of the United States .
the majority of migrants who travels through Tap@@ ach@@ ula comes from Central America , other inhabitants also open the doors of their homes to them .
José Antonio Cor@@ do@@ va Mel@@ én@@ dez tells me that he has fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children who were willing to black@@ mail from him without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for an accommodation and a unknown , a single moving , offered him its roof .
a few months later the family lives and she tries to decide where the next step is going .
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full again .
in the courses , the trav@@ ellers consult their phones .
a mini@@ bus arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , a large part from Somalia .
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy to be happy that her house is full , but it is also nost@@ al@@ gic , because of them that went away .
like a proud grandmother , she pe@@ aked in her album with many photos .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ya se fu@@ er@@ on &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she repe@@ ats each time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are already gone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install a monitoring app on their mobile phones .
one check @-@ point for personal communication instruments in X@@ inj@@ ang from Twitter users to the extent of war .
the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic min@@ orities in the West of China are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their mobile phones .
on July 10 , the mobile users in the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an District of the City of Ur@@ um@@ qi received a mobile notification , in which it re@@ jects the District Government to install a monitoring app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Cle@@ aning &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the message it is said that the app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to prevent access from terrorist information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the authorities will also use the app for more than the fight against terrorism .
according to an exclusive report of Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women have been arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ fecture , because they had previously installed the app , news with a private We@@ Chat Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the communication of the police , the app was to investig@@ ate the sources and the distribution channels of terrorists and , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; harmful information &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; including videos , images , books and documents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ gs website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elecom .
the main function is the block of por@@ no@@ graphic websites , from online fraud , Troj@@ ans and ph@@ ishing pages to help users to spend a lot of time them online and to remote control your own home network .
this app with the filters for min@@ ors should help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can naturally be used in many ways .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; state actors or even h@@ acker tend to manipul@@ ate or steal the home network of a person .
this introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
while reports of digital c@@ ens@@ orship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in the bigger cities in the east and south , the reality is very often dark for those who live in remote , displac@@ ed ethnic minority regions like X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in conflict zones , authorities are often correspon@@ d@@ ingly extreme cen@@ sored and surveillance measures as well as rout@@ in@@ ous internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the media out@@ let &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Images from New China &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , which publishes the cen@@ sored news in China , shown photos from a check@@ point , at the police ski@@ pped the residents , if they had installed the monitoring app . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian ensure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification required that people install the app within 10 days .
if you are detected at a check point with a device without this software , they could be imprisoned for up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back to technological development .
they comp@@ elled people to use devices that are intended for older people .
this is a form of captivity through the rest of the growth .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from New China &quot; ( Writ@@ ten of the New Year of War ) also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , from which the software can lift the passwords of a Windows operating system and thus gets un@@ restricted access to the computer &apos;s hard drive .
after the installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang computers and mobile phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
the rules in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may have a reaction to the instructions of the city party , to minim@@ ize the distribution of illegal content .
all government branches , authorities , and with the party connected facilities including universities and research institutions are oblig@@ ated to follow the instructions of Cyber@@ security Office in operation of their computer and communication instruments .
a recent report by Freedom House , a US American human rights organisation , also mentioned these new monitoring methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang the authorities released a regulation on 27 June in a district of regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi a regulation with the directive to all residents and entrepren@@ eurs until August 1 , its &quot; personal ID cards , phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks , and media storage cards &quot; at the local police .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the intention is obviously not to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist videos &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; this action viol@@ ates the personality right of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a whole series of other potential reasons , including those who relate to peaceful religious or political messages . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sleep or death , Part 1 : all cri@@ es after death

&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sleep or death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane notes his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot; &quot; &quot;
far away from our blue , virtual world you look at and stell@@ ar that you &apos;re all alone in a place where everything is important .
everything has been dissolved after and after dis@@ b@@ anded and a truth revealed clearly , both from inside and outside .
one that makes all glory to her name .
one that has struck down in a list of feelings and expres@@ sions that do not allow met@@ aph@@ ors .
but if you look into reality again and you look behind the scenes - beyond the acting , the beautiful scenes and the performer - turn the character into being from flesh and blood , and everything cri@@ es after death .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all doubt dissolve in smoke and you will keep you aware of your existence , even though the earth is rot@@ ated on the axis of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Un@@ he@@ ils &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; it becomes clear that you are tra@@ pped between the walls that have built your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone to stone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they have arrested me and my father three times , but this was not enough for me to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my lesson &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the head of the Security Council is form@@ ulated - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he put his power to us proof that he even destroyed the sim@@ pl@@ est concepts we knew .
five teen@@ agers were torn out during a peaceful protests like we@@ eds from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was enough to reduce the city the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scre@@ ams . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the city district cov@@ eted , only my own not .
for the first time it was still standing , reg@@ un@@ condition@@ ally , at the wrong time , even if I had no high demands on a city , which up to the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their compli@@ ces is zu@@ sted .
during the third night things got a little cal@@ med down after power supply would work in the neighborhood .
I broke the silence by crying several times &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; from my house roof .
I heard my voice contradic@@ ted by the silence .
a few minutes later , some of my friends felt brave enough to summar@@ ize .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends joined me ; we alli@@ ed to a magnificent picture which my expectations full and filled .
in such a moment , you realize that you get the spirit out of the lamp , but it is simply not in the least .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make you ready , we meet at the Military Security Building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he put up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I learned the following : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no matter how much honey you can go down - nothing can give you your voice , after you have made it all the way to the office of security from the body . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I arrived there .
the Colonel Gh@@ assan was there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I now also .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the colon@@ el gh@@ assan begins to speak : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me hear , as you cry out of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or you &apos;re just brave enough to scre@@ am when we are not near . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his eyes filled eyes were built upon me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you are wonder@@ ing what to look in the eyes , and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did , has nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood before this building .
maybe it was on my fool@@ ish@@ ness , vanity ; perhaps part of the revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was so confident that I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I did not think you have forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I think I never stopped to look at you in the eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me , and I regret no word of what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; put him in solo and his father right with them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; his father is with them . &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this cursed sat@@ ile lies to me until now in the nose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he became a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; syndrome , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a sec@@ ular torture which I was exposed for months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I scre@@ wing the farm .
in the first office , I leave everything I carry with me .
then back through the farm and into the second office , which leads through a gear to the individual cells .
I refer to all the details exactly before I super@@ vised the space .
otherwise they have shared a larger cell to me this time .
I have to share with only one other prisoner , and I must immediately put it without waiting for her permission .
after a few minutes felt like a whole life , the official left the cell , and I took back on an old tried communication method : to strike your f@@ ist against the wall .
I learned that my cell was a &quot; black@@ ain@@ ful . &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation he finally answered me .
apparently , in none of the surrounding cells , there was a respected man middle age which looks similar to me and called &quot; the doctor . &quot;
in perfect darkness , no significant face elev@@ ators can be seen , and physi@@ cians do not exist here ; we are all only numbers .
&quot; maybe someone whose voice sounds similar to me ? &quot;
all the answers connected its existence .
perhaps he was moved to one of the great cells .
perhaps he will be heard immediately .
the investig@@ ator had assured me , they would release him , if I remain .
li@@ ar .
I &apos;d like to have had a scar@@ ec@@ row to sell all of these cro@@ ws that lab@@ ori@@ ze the fruits in the garden of my head .
from the distance , I still hear &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; still scre@@ am .
it must be at about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time cry the cry , every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black saw the colour of per@@ dition , until I saw the yellow light that presented the hor@@ ror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( e.g. : &quot; Don@@ ner , &quot; An@@ ime on 13 . sending of the Kor@@ an ) .
&quot; they are here to be heard . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this was the mystery of the mystery : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to protect the state security in front of us and to prevent the terrorists in us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wit@@ e dial@@ ect - thus they played their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sec@@ essi@@ onal black@@ mailing card &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and made the narrow view of view of their world view . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not a house , which is no country ; it is a curse that call it co@@ exist@@ ance to transform the cl@@ an of their cl@@ an into a hero . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I cared for the inter@@ phone and meet Abu I@@ mad , a slender and sto@@ cky man ; at least he comes to me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he cap@@ tures a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; despite the expres@@ sions that carry him away , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can join this bapt@@ ism and protest to demonstrations , which will soon be an end anyway . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not answer .
I have acc@@ ust@@ omed to it , not to answer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can really no longer say when ins@@ ults and pun@@ ches have become a friendly discussion for me to become an ordinary means of communication . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when and how this happened , was un@@ important .
any voice in me told me that I had to get used to be punished , although I didn &apos;t have done anything to earn his sentence .
to punishment in all its diversity .
its command is to tear me as much flesh as possible from the body .
he calls the lov@@ ingly &quot; conf@@ ession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic pipe , which probably dates from the clo@@ ak .
your head rejo@@ ices at your scre@@ aming .
give him the pleasure , you cannot measure you with him , and you cannot with@@ stand your cry .
my cry was not enough for him , why they cast out the tube through a cable .
on my first arrest , I asked me whether the investig@@ ators had worked as a garbage collector , or if it belonged to normal working equipment .
they had pla@@ ited four cables in each other to present us from their point of view , great invention of a huge cable .
within a single hour three of them changed , while I was still in the row .
I had lost any feeling in my body - and my voice , why I heard at crying .
the Hen@@ ker re@@ marked the cooling down , and found no pleasure in all that he &apos;s next to an electri@@ cally invited rod .
electricity per@@ lock my whole body , enough to supply my whole neighborhood .
my semi @-@ naked body , which was stretched out on the ground , was the perfect black@@ heads .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back .
after two terrible hours , he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
it must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say , that was my only option .
a few hours passed , which came to me like minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
the door opens and the morning meets the room . &quot; R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sh@@ fu@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I answer with the voice of an exhau@@ st@@ ive youth : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my lord , my father has to worry about terrible trou@@ bles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; be silent and walk away , you will be laid . &quot;
this was new .
otherwise they had always released .
where do they lead me ? !
the Jord@@ anian Rap@@ per Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b talks about the rights of LGB@@ T@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b spend most of his time inside ; once again he kills him to his computer , to his computer , and again to his couch .
but what you can rely on is a cigarette between his fingers or his nic@@ otine ab@@ stain@@ ed lips .
he lives in the top floor of his family house , which has belonged to them since 1967 ; the year , in which Israel had finished his occupation of the West Bank and H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs family had been forced to flee from their village in Palestine where they had lived as fel@@ ah@@ ye@@ en ( about : farmer ) .
for now six years , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b is a passionate activ@@ ist , who is transferred to the conservative majority , and her old proven opinions about gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression by art and rap@@ music .
with his music , often deals with themes such as Ori@@ ent@@ alism , rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian refugee , but also calls for the nu@@ cle@@ us of the entire Arab world . all these topics are not only in his hometown Amman relev@@ ance , but also in cities leading up to San@@ aa within Yemen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its 25 years , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees himself as a man who is not restricted by limits , and it can be shared according to their own statement with people who have suffering from the devast@@ ating consequences of foreign inter@@ ventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even if he doesn &apos;t open it openly , he advoc@@ ates a special en@@ vious against the US foreign policy .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b looks at his studio in Amman .
recorded by the author .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b did not believe that his sympathy for those who try to do in war zones , something with his identity as &quot; Palestinian refugee &quot; of the second generation , signi@@ fies himself even if he was born in Jordan and never before in Palestine .
&quot; I don &apos;t think about my own lives so , &quot; st@@ resses H@@ d@@ ai@@ b .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think , because I am a man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while in water dissolved Nes@@ cafe in two cups . it is the holy month Ram@@ adan ; in this time it is planned for Muslims to fast @-@ sunset from sunrise to sunset . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also suggests that the public consumption of food is illegal during Ram@@ adan .
obviously H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee at a scor@@ ching hot young party did little to do with protest against Islam .
basically , the s@@ lu@@ p lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the s@@ quad@@ ron of the K@@ ent cigarette into the nose into the first line of freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky , especially when one cast a look inside the neighbor@@ ing countries .
hence , you simply avo@@ red basic things to do - as in public during Ram@@ adan , to drink water , not to land in prison .
recently , the Interior Ministry of the Interior has cancelled the performance of the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Le@@ ila , for the second time .
a number of par@@ liament@@ arians supported by the Islamic state front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argu@@ ed that the sexual orientation of the homosex@@ ual fron@@ tier Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no , contra@@ dict the cultural and traditional nor@@ ms of the country and the main reason for the corpor@@ ations I am concerned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the MPs and former spokes@@ man for the Islamic Coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CNN that the concert &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had been cancelled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the sexual orientation of the singer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many claim that commitment to the band &apos;s commitment in the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is a dangerous ac@@ ti@@ vis@@ m that raises the old trusted legitim@@ acy of author@@ itarian regim@@ es throughout the region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Le@@ ila estimates the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; progressive supporters of human rights &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which continue to continue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this statement is probably not easy to be sil@@ ky rhetor@@ ic , but actually a clear , cryst@@ alli@@ zing reality reflected in Jordan , which clearly occurs in H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs factory .
in 2016 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b returned to body sex nor@@ ms by re@@ formed his vision of the fate of Arabic women , the vo@@ re@@ hel@@ i@@ chen sex .
the image shows the skel@@ eton of a obviously cast unknown woman , whose arms and legs are lined up to the corners of the canvas .
she is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those who should really trust .
over the past years , the number of &apos; Hon@@ our &apos; of Hon@@ or &apos; has increased in Jordan - the un@@ official outside .
according to Human Rights Watch the number of Hon@@ or of Hon@@ or in 2016 reached its climax ; however , Jordan is still lacking that Jordan has become institutional infrastructure to support women , victims of attempted murder or domestic violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to a law for inter@@ ru@@ ptions in 1954 , women who are exposed to domestic violence , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to in@@ definite period in prison , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and for their liberation , often a years of bureau@@ cratic expenses and the guarantee of the family is necessary that the woman will do nothing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs music enjoys great popularity and is well @-@ known for it not to rep@@ ay the issues in its country long as tab@@ oos .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b den@@ ies that his work is politically , however , that he puts his music that is full of explic@@ it ass@@ ess@@ ments on sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression , not separate from politics .
&quot; I come out of the Middle East , Man .
I was in@@ scri@@ bed on politics , &quot; he says .
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b takes the question of Palestinian identity .
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; the focus again is on poverty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the list of songs that are on the core can be continued . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in March 2016 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b published a song titled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse repe@@ ats itself often :
&quot; you are free , and every other is it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the course of the song , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b describes the world as a kind of market appearing in his words , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can get what you want &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - be faith or failure , H@@ et@@ ero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he not@@ ices that hardly anybody in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and les@@ bians and that comments on the equality of LGB@@ T@@ Q + individuals were still heavily cen@@ sored in 2014 .
in 2014 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b performed an interview for the popular J@@ ord@@ an On@@ line@@ program Ro@@ ya , around later that his comments were torn out of the context , dist@@ orted and his mind was cen@@ sored .
&quot; on Youtube it was uploaded without inc@@ isions , but was only a revised version , &quot; he says .
today , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b ac@@ qui@@ res the Arabic LGB@@ T@@ Q + community and represent the opinion that int@@ ol@@ er@@ ance towards homosexu@@ als does not dis@@ agree with Islam .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ vo , a poet of the eighth century , who is still stuck today thanks to his hom@@ o@@ erotic poems .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b asks : if Abu Nu@@ vo , who once again work on behalf of the Cali@@ ph , could write openly about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jordan do not ?
the real problem , so H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , I have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; Le@@ ila , or the fact that the concert was cancelled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the H@@ ash@@ em@@ ite Kingdom there is nothing new that the government has attacks on free expression and that progressive votes are to be sil@@ enced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian newspaper authority issued several former govern@@ ors and members of the teaching authority , with the grounds that they would argue on comments in social media critical to the problems associated with deeply rooted in the land .
given that , H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs &apos;s opinion is therefore only the top of the ice@@ berg - the real challenge is to make structural changes in the next generation of the Jord@@ an@@ ians .
for him , progress is a permanent giving and take . Jordan has stopped for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - so it sees H@@ d@@ ai@@ b - consists of slow , bed@@ time and inner changes . it is sure that these changes will take place every day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society .
in the end , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , like millions of other Arabs also , dreams of a Arab world without inter@@ ventions from abroad .
he is not only dre@@ aming about bringing his work to Bagh@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to experience it . &quot;
perhaps the region will conver@@ se through music , art and literature of a true and fundamental op@@ enness - and not by bombs , spreading un@@ itions and to artificial nature . at least he hopes .
until it is done , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b will continue to be res@@ cu@@ ed and therefore also resist resistance .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 largest festivals in Japan .
these big , extravag@@ ant war@@ riors are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
it is assumed that there is a variation of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata Festival , which is usually also celebrated in August in many areas of To@@ ho@@ kus . a further theory has taken over for over a thousand years , and out of a time , in the north @-@ east coast of Japan , to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we could catch some great seats , so we have a super view .
you can only imagine how big these parts are ...
a joint center in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , hosted a two @-@ month exhibition at W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally ) .
I &apos;ve been watching the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two wag@@ ons are to be seen .
however , for many people who take the journey to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true feeling - and yet another breathtaking way to spend his summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer Festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a 18 meter high car was amazing .

rarely , external appearance and body care were so important as in this story , because they help to maintain the Peruvian youth from crime and to promote a legitim@@ ate profession like the hair@@ war@@ der .
El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us most important harbour , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historical center of the capital Lima , a region with a very high crime rate , where road noise and illegal drugs are everyday .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region cannot feel safe .
at the same time , Peru - how many other medium and South American countries experienced - rising demand for men &apos;s aesthetic services .
the trend , appearance and therefore also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous sport@@ s@@ men such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or Ne@@ ym@@ ar ( Brazil ) , has led to more standardi@@ zation in the experienced hands of hair@@ dressing to make these elabor@@ ate hair@@ styles .
the un@@ preced@@ ented demand for hair@@ styles that go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition of hair@@ dres@@ s@@ ers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been held since 2014 .
there experts stand against each other in order to show , who can create the ec@@ centric direc@@ tives as you can see in the following video ( more videos on current competitions there are on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as the school August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , who found himself in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to exchange their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools , and instead of bad advice to find training in hair@@ dresser , which allows them to find work .
motivated by this activity and the bi@@ oci@@ ous opportunities , dozens of young people saw that she is able to sei@@ ze a profession which is currently in fashion .
before the school year , the school offered special apprentic@@ eship workshops which began in March and reported some of their successes :
in 1995 we were the only specialist in the community and the district , where@@ on we are very proud , because from love to children we have built this educational community .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the following article is the revised version of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declaration of love &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by gu@@ err@@ illa fighters &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which has published the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the post is published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people who know ?
is it not much more important , people who feel e@@ jected to bring affection ?
this question was exactly the question of the young Colom@@ bian activists Leonardo P@@ á@@ r@@ ra@@ ga from the Young Youth Foundation and inspired her to campaign cart@@ as p@@ or la recur@@ on@@ cili@@ ación ( letters to reconciliation ) , the young people encouraged to write gu@@ err@@ illas letters .
recently , its country was the show@@ place of a historic event , and they wanted to contribute to their part : after years of negotiations the Colom@@ bian government had closed a peace agreement with the gu@@ err@@ illa movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary Armed Forces colum@@ bi@@ ens ) , which forms the end of the longest war in Latin America .
International was given the signing of the peace agreement as so important that the Colom@@ bian president José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its .
however , there is a long way ahead of Kolum@@ bi@@ an@@ ians until one can speak of a real reconciliation and peace .
Gu@@ err@@ ill@@ ak@@ im , who lived for many years in illegal camps , were exposed to a war rhetor@@ ic and around the clock , having carried their weapons in themselves , must now re @-@ integrate into the life as civilians .
the Colum@@ bian society , in turn , having become acc@@ ust@@ omed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hate to gu@@ err@@ illa fights , must support them in their ranks and support them when building a new life .
Leonardo and Crist@@ ian were convinced that the young Colum@@ bi@@ ans have had to close together and would have to help with the integration process .
and this is exactly what they did : until now , thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former gu@@ err@@ illa strug@@ gles to welcome them back in society .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former gu@@ err@@ atic fighters - which will then be handed over personally . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Valentine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
the idea for reconciliation originated in the world summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bog@@ ot@@ á in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Crist@@ ian had the opportunity to talk short with Kail@@ ash Sat@@ y@@ arth@@ i , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained that we will write to the man that we love thousands of love letters on Valentine , but those who need them much more necessary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said he continued to share his love with people this year , needed most urgent inquiries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the plan , letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC will have to build their place in society and to build a new life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the letters will show that Colom@@ bian society is ready to make a dis@@ course of a common history of peace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they say . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so far , more than 2,000 letters were collected during the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities throughout Colombia , such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á .
&apos;@@ i &apos;d never thought that someone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over to the UN camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region on 19 March .
a group of 40 students from the University of J@@ aver@@ iana in Cal@@ i , two members of the Municip@@ ality of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Bog@@ ot@@ Art Foundation to the camps , to transfer the letters .
the members of the F@@ ARC appeared as they had done earlier , to meet the commands of their leaders .
but this time they did not receive orders , but letters full of submission from people all over the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is incredible how many different feelings you can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that lies in between , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Political science student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z Av@@ ila later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the governor of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca described this unforgettable experience so :
after passing the letters , a former fighter s@@ led me through the camp of gu@@ err@@ illa fighters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when I saw in one of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( a kind of hut , in which gu@@ err@@ illa strug@@ gles live ) , I saw a gu@@ err@@ atic fighters who wrote something . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was afraid to go in , because next to him on the bed a M@@ GL p@@ omeg@@ ran@@ gers , a le@@ thal weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I said to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hello , what are they doing now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer a letter I wrote to me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; never in my life someone has written something so beautiful , therefore I answer it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly tears ran across the che@@ eks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I hu@@ gged him completely and sat next to the p@@ omeg@@ ran@@ ates .
perhaps he was sorry , I was sorry for all those years of faithful companion of this struggle , and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he never expected anything else from life . he had the only way to preserve him and his six brothers in front of the Hung@@ er@@ to@@ d . &quot; I never thought that anyone would forgive me for my fault .
but now I know that there is a society there , waiting with open arms waiting for us .
until now , I have only learned how I have to deal with weapons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but now where peace rules , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new voices
at the beginning , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC joined a discussion round .
students were all grown up as already war and the F@@ ARC were already in secret .
therefore the leader of the F@@ ARC said the history of the organization , its ide@@ als and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we experienced how to develop the social in@@ justice on the whole Colum@@ bian people . now , where we have the opportunity to help us develop a political party , we can contribute to the society in this country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a goal of this mag@@ n@@ itude , it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
these people listen , which had never been heard so far and had no suff@@ rage , and to know that the people I have seen often as monsters and even hate people with beautiful feelings , that were rot@@ ated by their lives and their environment was very painful for me .
the reality in which the country lives , hurt me .
but it comforts me that all people - also those who are killed and so much harm may cause us to teach us and give a smile and a hug .
many former fighters answered the letters .
Gust@@ avo Gonz@@ á@@ lez , commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Her@@ ío de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ vo , Archbishop of the city of Cal@@ i , following letter :
the colum@@ bi@@ an@@ ians were proph@@ es@@ ied that after dis@@ arm@@ ament peace would reign .
but this is not the case .
as long as there is ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment possibilities , there will always be people who are willing to raise up and protest to their rights . and that is also completely justified ( ... ) .
we of the F@@ ARC now put peace on a policy without weapons .
therefore , we call all def@@ enders of peace - no matter which race , religion or ide@@ ology they belong - to get over all those who dream of a country in the war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifices , because we know from his own experience that nothing is simple . be the one among us who defend life as a basis of existence , many difficulties are imp@@ ending .
there will be many obstacles on our way , but together we will overcome them .

homosex@@ ual and que@@ er people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a great variety of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail .
with fear , activists have witnessed the coverage of the last few months over the persecution of gay men in Che@@ chn@@ ya .
but the threat , which depends on the LGB@@ T@@ Q community of the LGB@@ T@@ Q community , did not come about overnight .
OC Media had the opportunity to speak with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny , who shared some of their experiences with us and talked with us what is currently happening in the republic .
several months ago , the LGB@@ T@@ Q legal situation in Che@@ chn@@ ya has conquered the international head@@ lines , after reports published , causing deteri@@ oration , torture and killing of que@@ er men in the republic .
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the Now@@ aya Gaz@@ eta . she threw a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities , who susp@@ ects two susp@@ ects , and they put into secret pris@@ ons in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; they brought a monster to the World &quot;
Sabrina , a Trans@@ woman , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there .
ever since childhood , she felt that she was a woman in reality .
when they grew up , you became aware that Che@@ chn@@ ya was not a secure place for them , which was why she went to Moscow .
after a group had been experienced by the Gender Equality group , the hunt was opened to Sabrina .
they went out of fear for her life last end in the US .
Sabrina : I was working as volunteer hel@@ per in a human rights organisation .
one day , someone told me that someone needed my help .
it was a friend of Da@@ gest@@ an , a Trans@@ woman who was in trouble .
she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while I tried to help her , he was a friend , a copy of my documents and spread it anywhere on the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , he sent them to Che@@ chn@@ ya , with the following message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then there are no men in Che@@ chn@@ ya , who can solve this shame ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
afterwards the photos of my documents made the whole W@@ hat@@ s@@ App the round .
I was attacked on 10 October 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when I was just doing a few grocery bags of my car &apos;s seat , I heard a male voice saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Here &apos;s a gift for you from your uncle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I hurt nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time on Che@@ chen : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long do you still desire the family , you sc@@ are ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
I only know that there was a young man , no 30 years old .
then I lost consciousness and woke up last end in the hospital .
apparently some women had got involved and started scre@@ am .
the man was fled .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital , I knew that I had two perc@@ ussions in my right lung wing .
OC Media : in which case wings were you laid - in men or women ?
Sabrina : my documents are ob@@ sol@@ ete , there is my male name on it ; but the doctor understood and put me to the women .
I am very grateful to him for that .
when I read his name for the first time in his office , I got to do it with fear ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ cas@@ ian name .
but he turned out to be a good man .
I am grateful to him that he is respec@@ tful with me .
I spent more than a month in hospital .
I got threats last February .
they called me , wrote me - relatives , stranger , some completely unknown .
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives .
the asked to send me back to Che@@ chn@@ ya to prove that it was a lie .
they asked absurd demands : some said to me , I have put it in , by running up through the streets ; others wanted that I had not changed my sex in Gros@@ ny , that all my sex was not only bad , and Photoshop .
I have grain size C - what should I have to say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sabrina : it is still hard for them .
some older people once talked to my mother on the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You brought a monster to the world , which has not only beg@@ ged your family , but the entire Republic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my mother became too much and she lay a rope around his neck .
luckily the neighbours came and saved them .
at the time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved into an apartment and a few hours later there was a car with a dar@@ ken@@ ed window and a plate plate with a capacity of 95 .
after the third time , it was clear to me that there was a bit lazy .
my human righ@@ t@@ ler friends checked the number plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sabrina : with the help of activists .
for safety reasons , I don &apos;t want to give up their names , but I will say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with her help , I left the country , but then something unbelievable happened .
I can &apos;t compre@@ hend how it could be .
just before my departure from Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived .
I bought it without regist@@ ering me , without ID , without anything .
I broke my old SIM card and thrown them in the tr@@ ash .
arrived and checked in the hotel .
the number was registered to a stranger .
I put the SIM card to my cell phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the moment , when I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t believe you about security , just because you left the country ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
you know our people know what you do . you even know your room number .
just to prove it , it is number 115 . &quot;
can you imagine this ? !
that was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in touch with your family ?
Sabrina : only with my mother and my sisters .
however , we don &apos;t talk about gender equality , this is a table theme .
I still carry some traditional Cau@@ cas@@ ian elements in me .
as much as I wish it , I can &apos;t overcome this spiritual barrier .
I always say that while my mother is alive , I will do my best to hurt them .
when we ch@@ atting with camera , I really give a effort to look like the person to look at them from their past - so my male form .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know something about the current situation in Che@@ chn@@ ya ?
what are your friends , those who are the d@@ ord@@ ed ?
Sabrina : I submitted a report last week in Washington .
for me , I needed current information about the situation in Che@@ chn@@ ya .
I talked to someone who has one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he told that during Ram@@ adan , he was not arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait , and he did not lock out a new wave .
most likely they will focus on family and relatives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so that my dear , they probably invite their relatives , take care of the problem with the affected person and at the end require a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honor &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has received through blood satisfaction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : are men still gay in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sabrina : a friend of mine , there were just not many .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if , especially those who have no rich relatives or who have dropped from their relatives to place Kad@@ y@@ rows court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as far as I know , they are arrested there , so that you can present them as terrorists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If they are killed , they will show their bodies in television and claim they would have attacked any village or military base . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you understand ?
as if these people were not simply disappeared , but sub@@ merged to radic@@ alize themselves .
OC Media : is this only a guess or have you a source of this information ?
Sabrina : I just quote someone who imprisoned for one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he says that many people have van@@ ished in this prison after their be@@ ard had grown .
there has been nothing new of them since .
they simply have taken them .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was even involved when these people were involved .
however , until now they were not presented as band@@ its , but there were no reports so far . we susp@@ ect that such actions are possible .
why otherwise could it not have been allowed to shave this man ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; do you know whether these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; orientation , were already held in the past ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sabrina : I always wore my hair long .
in Che@@ chn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think that before 2003 I was already living in Gros@@ se than I lived there - and I never had any problems .
in Ernst !
even from 1998 to 1999 when the Sh@@ aria was considered , I never had any problems .
on the contrary , it was much safer than now .
Russia , initially wanted to lead us to &quot; civil society , &quot; ultimately threw us back into the Stone Age .
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sabrina : my bro@@ ws were ri@@ pped ; I had coloured lashes , bore tubes je@@ ans and short tops .
the Ministry of Safety of Sh@@ aria never pushed me a hair .
before the Russian theatre in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every night , especially at weekends , a whole group of people met me .
it was a small place where several ben@@ ches stood , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , met there .
we were never off@@ ended .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a Rede@@ mp@@ ing : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; Sp@@ otte don &apos;t talk about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
people often say to children , if they make fun of sick .
OC Media : so you simply have your eyes closed before you because they believed you were ill ?
Sabrina : yes .
they never ins@@ ulted me , never hun@@ ted and never defeated .
OC Media : how long did this grace period last ?
Sabrina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ rov came up with the plan .
when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 he began to talk about moral television .
he did not speak about us , but primarily about the behavior of women .
nevertheless - you could feel how people started to change in the city .
who was laughing and laughed before , wonder@@ ing at once with suspicion .
in time , I left Che@@ chn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home I could feel how the situation in the republic was steadily wor@@ sen@@ ed .
OC Media : what activity do you start now ?
Sabrina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month in the US .
apart from that , I am still working as an activ@@ ist .
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organize Te@@ et@@ re@@ ffs , meetings , I realize them to hospital and help them to get food types .
I have no cents for this .
I discovered these people myself when I revol@@ t away .
I am Muslims and want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ den@@ ab ?
Sabrina : that &apos;s al@@ right .
so is nature , it has nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same as Che@@ chens , who proph@@ esy with foam before the mouth , that there is no gay ones with them .
the Da@@ gest@@ ans have the Cab@@ ard@@ inian that , the Russians also have which ; on the whole planet it is - but not in Che@@ chn@@ ya . &quot;
I come from there , so it &apos;s annoying to hear something .
I meet so many men of the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - pract@@ ising Muslims who go into the mosque and fast during Ram@@ adan - live together with men .
do you know , many think of tran@@ si@@ dent@@ ition about men who love men and believe that you have been changing his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a tru@@ der .
these are two different things - two different kinds of feeling to be exact , different life settings .
for me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed for my body .
not if I have a partner or not .
sorry I &apos;m going to be so personal here , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago .
and I am not sad at all . I just know that I am myself now .
local groups war@@ n before an increase of self @-@ moral within the persecution Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suff@@ ers from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate within the native Arab population .
since the last few months , there has been a strong rise in self @-@ mor@@ nings .
the photograph of the Arab worker in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
the self @-@ burning of a man named Jas@@ sim Mor@@ amaz@@ i on 27 August backward the desper@@ ate situation of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi community in Iran , influenced by poverty and unemployment .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the southwest of Iran .
he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he ashamed for his own hel@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness to allow in@@ capability for his family , so Ah@@ w@@ azi movements to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and want to remain anonymous .
a video shared on YouTube held the moments when he had lit up himself .
some people made it fast to er@@ ase the flames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ eg@@ hani hospital in the town of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources , the burns were so strong that the doctors could do nothing more .
he died a short time later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not the only suicide that is happening in August within the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi minority , and activists on the place war@@ n before , that more men could take life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ah@@ w@@ azi Centre for Human Rights Announ@@ ced this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ b@@ awi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im .
their stories have a thing in common : there were all family fathers that felt thanks to persecution on the Iranian government , hel@@ pless and unable to feed their families and follow a safe work .
Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region , where a majority of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi community living in Iran , was rock@@ ed by a profound economic crisis , which makes it difficult for the local Arab population to deny their living .
one century ago , the Arab A@@ wa@@ z was an predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ahl@@ avi Empire took power , and in 1925 great efforts to stop the ethnic autonomy throughout Iran .
in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran , as well as some of the most common areas for Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the local population receives only little of this wealth .
it is often victims of un@@ treated diseases , hunger and de@@ structive .
the Iranian regime ref@@ uses to systematic jobs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industry .
the government also built a multitude of dem@@ men , the waters of the Arab territ@@ ories in the Persian areas where the provinces Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ hom lie .
these dam@@ s have led only to destroy the devast@@ ation caused by dr@@ y@@ ness in the region , and to destroy the local agriculture as well as fish and palm trees .
the unemployment rate among the Arabic @-@ Hawai@@ ian young people now rose to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian general director of co@@ operative , work and social welfare , reported that 5 % of Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is who finished school , ended 55 % a secondary school and 45 % made a university degree .
a &quot; systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance &quot;
Kar@@ im Doh@@ im@@ i , an Iranian ancest@@ or human rights activ@@ ist with residence in London , told Global Vo@@ ices , that the current situation , a mixture of poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high increase &quot; of the number of self @-@ moral men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ken@@ im@@ i said that especially the unemployment nowadays has become worse . the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ sians and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the setting process : &quot; &quot; &quot;
since officials and institutions pre@@ fers not set Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi calls for access to work opportunities in all sectors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance to young Arabs and force them to earn their living outside of their home Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are people who had to change their ancest@@ or and sur@@ name to have their affili@@ ation to hide their affili@@ ation , since even Arab names cannot be toler@@ ated , because the speech of the Arabic language or the wearing of Arabic clothing must be toler@@ ated .
given the circumstances related to Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi , human rights activ@@ ist alarm before the situation explo@@ sives .
it remains to wait , whether the world is w@@ aking up and decre@@ ases .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoid@@ able .

&quot; why don &apos;t I identify with femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ c@@ tion@@ alen ? &quot;
detail of a photos . recorded by : Pix@@ el@@ ay . published under the CC@@ 0 Creative Commons License .
the following article is a revised edition of comments written by Ay@@ om@@ ide zur@@ i and originally published on the website of Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as . article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions appeared .
you can read in the comments under the original text .
if I say that I am not a femin@@ ist , many women respond to especially white women who see themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - with fru@@ stration .
you wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even put forth well @-@ thought scientific and social arguments from me , why I should be femin@@ ist and why we generally should be all femin@@ ist * inside .
for example , women nowadays still earn less money despite equal education than men .
that women are still under strict observation , when it comes to what they can do with her body .
that violence against women is a global epidemic .
or that cultural and social standards still ensure that women so@@ oner or later in various areas of life to a glass ceiling , and that discrimination based on gender is still moving across the many different countries and beliefs .
all of this is aware and known .
I am convinced that I am tw@@ ins double and thre@@ e@@ fold .
I am a black woman .
and yet , if I have to talk on skin colour , on rac@@ ism , on black women &apos;s women , on black women in the LGB@@ T@@ Q community or to black women from the Dias@@ pora , as we have always been ab@@ used in ra@@ cial and verbal exercise , as well as outside the femin@@ ist movement , many white femin@@ ists left and white inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists have to be silent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but still all agree that women - all women - should come together to sing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their voices &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &apos; K@@ umb@@ aya , my lord &apos; to sing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to achieve equality ( some ) of women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they don &apos;t want to talk about sexu@@ alised violence in addition to sexu@@ alised violence that we exposed black women to two times . &quot; &quot; &quot;
or about that black women and women of other eth@@ nic@@ ities and country locations earn less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with a migration background often referred to the school as white girls , due to obvious integration problems .
or that women in black spher@@ es and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk , domestic violence and violence in partnership to suffer as white women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want all men to have the same rights for all men , and all men all of any kind of man ; on the other hand I can &apos;t consider myself as a black woman in whose center the white woman is to take into account both of the gender and skin colour of a person . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am tired and I will not fight for my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ femin@@ ist @-@ oriented sphere , which always count me and countless other black women and always rejected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 1851 , So@@ jour@@ ner compl@@ ained in her speech : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I also ref@@ ine to maintain an ide@@ ology in which the black woman is a human and mar@@ gin@@ alised beings in a historical regard . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ref@@ ine to join group@@ ings , which also absorb our customs and customs through cultural inc@@ lin@@ ation to drive their eg@@ o@@ centric program . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will no longer try to specify white women the importance of the convic@@ tion of skin colour and gender . because some of them will continue to keep the meaning of black women for femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women are trying to teach them a better . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded in order to be a home to women and dis@@ soci@@ ate itself from white femin@@ ism , the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; is still in its name .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I take it before me to draw me full and completely from femin@@ ism , which was called for my dark skin and my status as a woman , instead of a white @-@ femin@@ ist para@@ dig@@ m that is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is more important than ever that we define black women in accordance with our own ideas and set us into the spher@@ es that are created by us for us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson - We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ can@@ a wom@@ an@@ ism : Rec@@ la@@ zing O@@ ur@@ selves ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : as we can defend ourselves , in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , mental , physical and even the spiritual elements can be rever@@ ed , which represent the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ als are immediately called Separ@@ at@@ ism and exclusion , after reading these lines , I ask you to inform about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and contradic@@ tions of femin@@ ist movement , of which the black woman is affected .
in a bl@@ ur@@ istic environment I can lift black women and women of other cultures , as I don &apos;t exist in this para@@ dig@@ m .
I will be recognized as part of this para@@ dig@@ m due to my dark skin and due to my existence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in a environment , in which my life neither passed , nor ignored , nor rejected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pad@@ del@@ ing against the pollution : the mission of a man to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations
this post by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports in@@ special efforts to solving environmental problems .
in the context of an content @-@ sharing agreement , this article will be published here again .
Nabil Mus@@ a traveled again in the past 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or in can@@ oe - with a special concern through the region Kurdistan in Iraq . its mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations .
in this documentary by Emily Kin@@ s@@ key we follow Mus@@ a , who explains us his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of the pollution on his church .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I absolutely wanted to do something for the river which we had lost when I was a child , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mus@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dam@@ s , the pollution and un@@ controll@@ able development , will lead to an immediate so@@ vereign debt crisis in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a member of the NGO Iraq - a subsidiary of Water@@ keeper Alliance - who is preparing and work to protect the rivers , streams , and water paths in Iraq as well as to support local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the video , Mus@@ a sum@@ s up the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we had no water , how would we survive ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this video was produced for En@@ sia von Emily Kin@@ s@@ key , a documentary filmmaker and a multifunctional journalist , produced in Er@@ bil , Iraq .
the emphasis on their work is followed , little considerable sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of co@@ operative vide@@ ography and new multi @-@ media techniques , with their help and op@@ pressed churches , their stories can tell their way .
Paraguay : women and her more difficult fight against violence
&quot; &quot; &quot; a group of women is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The weeping women &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to express their pain on the women &apos;s mor@@ ale in the country and in the region and show its re@@ jection . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; the following article is the shortened and revised edition of the article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the article belongs to the number # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # ant@@ lich@@ en@@ ef@@ rau@@ bin ) published on the violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; &quot;
most names have been changed to protect the affected persons .
a police commander said A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez , that she had nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her Ex@@ sp@@ ouse who could be violent against violent .
since the end of her relationship was a little time passed and the police said that her statement would be put to the files , but more could not be done .
as a further wife Bal@@ bu@@ ena showed due to mist@@ re@@ at@@ ment , the acute display of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez was also useful .
a few days later the second woman with@@ drew her ad .
to break the v@@ icious circle of violence against women is difficult .
if women want to make an ad at all , they generally receive support from the State .
in many cases , women are also fin@@ anci@@ ally dependent on the men who abuse them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit that victims of violence should be in case of prosec@@ uting authorities .
inhal@@ t@@ 1 But@@ ge and Statist@@ ical 2 In@@ visible ab@@ uses and an infr@@ in@@ gement system , which does not inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ate 3 ts@@ ays laws : good approach , defective execution of blo@@ ws and statistics
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is hard to see how many women are actually mis@@ used , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ á@@ lez , a socialist research institution in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are various information and reports , but not even accum@@ ulate the extent of gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the figures available are al@@ ar@@ ming .
in 2015 , at the Bar District At@@ tor@@ ney General , 9@@ 600 ads went on account of domestic violence . at 70 % of them , there were violence against women .
86 % of ads in the police came from women .
there were more than 5000 ads because of domestic violence in peace stories . 86 % of women &apos;s ads came here .
in the ads , 40 % of women were killed physically and 55 % of women spoke of mental abuse .
these statistics however show not the true mag@@ n@@ itude of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ sian women &apos;s minist@@ ries Ana Bai@@ ardi will actually appear only a few of these off@@ ences . &quot; on every woman in Paraguay for mental failure , 9 women who do not do this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; any women who are reimbur@@ sed because of physical abuse are two women who do not do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said at the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since women &apos;s murder in Paraguay is not an own criminal , the prosecution authorities cannot be documented , as many women killed each year from their current or former partners .
by August 2016 , journalists numbered at least 12 cases of female mur@@ ders in the country .
the coordin@@ ator of human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to estimates , in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies due to violence by men .

invisible Mis@@ sions and a legal system that under@@ takes nothing
before Mariana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z , his strong friend of Carlos Vera , he insist@@ ed that she named him the names of all her former friends .
at the beginning , she didn &apos;t want to do that , but then she wanted to repent .
Mariana is 28 years old and has not been working together with Carlos . but for two years , she contributed the mental force of his part - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most serious :
I never thought I would have been victims of abuse .
when I read about it earlier , I thought that this only happens to be sub@@ mis@@ ed , because they are fool@@ ed by violent men .
I was convinced that I would never happen .
Mariana applied social media to report on the mist@@ re@@ at@@ ment by Carlos Vera .
without name , she wrote contributions on Facebook in which she described his ins@@ ults and various attacks during their two @-@ year relationship and told how he had ins@@ ulated them .
many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rhetor@@ ical , whether he ever raised his hand against them , and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse .
other Facebook users asked Mariana , why they had fallen the so long of Carlos and did not leave him earlier .
it almost seemed like they were saying that victims of abuse would at least have a certain complic@@ ity in it .
Victoria Santos , who is not out of Paraguay , fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner is har@@ assed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o te Cre@@ o network ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) which consists of women all in any way victims of abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the group you can talk to others about their experience , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the women &apos;s statements seriously .
in Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as all began with psychological abuse .
her wealthy partner even managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat them .
Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as displays ads to the authorities without any result and of their relatives , she received no support .
it led a trial against her former partner who developed into an op@@ a@@ que judicial struggle between Paraguay and its native country , in which it went mainly to make money , power and influence of her former partner .
Paraguay : good Appro@@ ach , fla@@ wed implementation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay , there are many laws that are very good , but not applied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ad of abuse is a path of resist@@ ors and a fight against corruption in the justice &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Victoria Santos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , also sees great problems with the application of laws in the country .
a bill was discussed under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ El@@ la ( # Für@@ y ) on 10 August 2016 .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os movement ( # Non@@ inclu@@ sions ) are part of a campaign on Twitter that is supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original draft of the law sees to explain f@@ ici@@ des to a standing off@@ ense and harder to pun@@ ish and harder to pun@@ ish as it is the case already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , the Legisl@@ ative text has changed in some points to win the de@@ pu@@ ties for the law , that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions , which are currently banned in Paraguay , and can be punished with up to five years imprisonment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the original bill expected to get the majority of the ( bureau@@ cratic and economic ) process costs , which have to present the victims of violence themselves , if they just want to report up and secure accommodation to the state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ech@@ ter@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the legisl@@ ature does not provide sufficient financial resources to this :
in Paraguay , mist@@ re@@ ation is seen as part of human relationships .
here , a memory must take place so that violence is not considered to be a little northern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he who is silent in the face of these facts makes us guilty , and he will get away the perpet@@ rators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have to refund so long display until mist@@ re@@ at@@ ment is no longer considered normal .
on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Senate , but before that parts of the law had been altered , but among other things a passage was cancelled , which the partners called in cases of domestic violence to reconciliation .
opinions about the changes are going apart .
the section regarding reconciliation has been seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor , to attack his victim again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the string of words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gender &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; political force &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of parts of the law applies however as great set@@ backs . &quot; &quot; &quot;

according to a newspaper , independent media in Oman will continue to ban on a newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website was closed due to a decision of the Minister of Information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the website of the banned newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a year ago , the Iranian authorities have closed the independent Arabic @-@ speaking newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of its reporting on corruption in the Sult@@ an@@ ant .
You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , remains in prison , where he served a prison sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , Ibrahim Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i were also arrested and arrested , but later returned .
Oman has been governed by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn Said , who came to power since 1970 when he had made his father , Said i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur .
since then , in addition to his role as the only sult@@ an , the most important offices in the country : Prime Minister , Secretary of Defense , Supreme Commander , Minister of Finance , Foreign Affairs , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the dom@@ ination of the sult@@ ans is characterized by the persist@@ ence efforts of security forces , in particular of domestic secrets , public freedom , independent journalists , blo@@ gger and other activists to fol@@ ate , in@@ ti@@ mi@@ date and incar@@ n@@ ate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the authorities will system@@ atically pursue peaceful and legitim@@ ate activities in the field of human rights , including activists , about their views on public matters of the country such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the attack on the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper , its closure , and imprisonment of three of its editors last year is a hard blow for press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper in which since its inc@@ eption in 2007 was reported on corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on July 28 , 2016 , in the newspaper , Ibrahim Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , chief editor of Az@@ am@@ n , firm , issued an article entitled &quot; High @-@ level parties &quot; hands of the judi@@ ci@@ ary . this was in the judicial proceedings and the interference of high @-@ ranking officials in judicial decisions .
in the report , government officials were accused of having dismissed the Jud@@ gment of the Supreme Court in Oman , to raise a judgment in a inheritance .
issue of the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper dated July 26 , 2016 with a report on the front page with the heading : &quot; high @-@ ranking parties bind hands of justice . &quot;

on 3 August 2016 , he was arrested by Al @-@ Abr@@ i , member of the Committee on the Special Operations and was arrested on his arrival by the security forces .
on 9 August 2016 , the ISS had the Deputy Chief of You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j who had acted as Chief Editor to Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ aris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the paper was closed on in@@ definite period , after the minister of information had given the statement , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the publication and spread of the paper on any way , including online , from 9 August 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the trial took place on 26 September 2016 in Mas@@ kat the first trial in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i .
the court sentenced the three journalists to prison and also ordered the final closing of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were also convicted of distur@@ b@@ ance of public order , &quot; mis@@ use of the internet &quot; and &quot; sub@@ ordin@@ ation of the civil state . &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of the violation of a public ban and s@@ lander .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years of imprisonment and fin@@ es in the amount of each 3,000 US dollar ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) and was imposed a year @-@ old prohibition against the two journalists .
al @-@ Abr@@ i was condemned to one year in prison and a fine of 1000 R@@ ial ( 2600 US dollar ) after having been using the use of a information network for the distribution of material that could be a danger to the public order &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was found guilty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Al @-@ Abr@@ i a damages deposit of 5000 om@@ anic R@@ ial ( 13 000 USD ) was sti@@ pul@@ ated and he was released from prison on 22 August 2016 .
the Appeals Court pronounced Al @-@ Abr@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but sentenced Al @-@ Ha@@ j to a year and al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari to six months in prison .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 after the arrest of his six @-@ month prison term in Mas@@ kat . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison , where he served his sentence .
the Appeals Court also ended the decision of the Ministry of Information , the &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; newspaper .
despite the decision of the court , Az@@ am@@ n returns once again , the paper is subject to attacks by the Iranian government .
on 8 January , the Minister of Information released a statement which was extended by the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; for three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information personally signed an additional statement , in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months and with which the minister was given another time against the decision of the Appeals Court , the publication of the newspaper resumed .
the last closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where the press freedom was injured in Oman .
other injuries include the closure of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercising pressure on al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to put its operation .
due to the pro@@ longed closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the detention of journalists Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the om@@ anic authorities are still not ready to make an end to the extensive bre@@ ach of press freedom .
Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls for the om@@ anic authorities to :
1 . You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately release and un@@ condition@@ ally release ;
2. to create a secure environment for the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper so that their journalists can follow their job ;
3 . to protect the press freedom in the country and
4 . under any circumstances , human rights and journalists in Oman may un@@ hin@@ der their righ@@ tful human rights work un@@ hin@@ dered and without fear of inheritance , including judicial sh@@ ic@@ ans .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organisation , the human rights def@@ enders ( including independent journalists , blo@@ gger , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and the right to gather peaceful , supported and provide protection .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , picture takes place with his consent .
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media or not at all . this is a growing area addressed to the most urgent needs of the continent .
for the need of medical research , there are two reasons : to have a lack in the offer of global healthcare , many medicines and vacc@@ ines dis@@ covering the special medical need on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ culosis and malaria have a major problem in the p@@ oo@@ rest countries of Africa , and lack of investments in the discovery of these diseases caused by the pharmaceutical companies .
secon@@ dly , research , which is carried out by African scientists to develop their own research capacity in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be eligible for economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is director of the Center for Inf@@ ectious diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) .
he grew up in the 1990s in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just as the AIDS epidemic was first engraved on national health .
he left Zambia for studying in the United States , initially in Louisiana , later in Indiana .
as post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he resear@@ ched himself on HIV virus before he decided to go home back home to support the sam@@ ic health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understanding of media about this research .
( Dis@@ cla@@ imer : Dr. War@@ rier talks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( G@@ V ) : what is your research theme ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the sam@@ ba national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
in addition , I start a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ o@@ gens .
G@@ V : what are the important current knowledge of science in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
this has to change , otherwise we will always be the receiver instead of being makers himself .
the solutions that we get are not well used in our environment , and sometimes it is impossible to use them here .
G@@ V : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are supported differently .
it is difficult to find people coming back or here , because the financing and development opportunities are better in other countries .
G@@ V : what is the research infrastructure ?
what kind of obstacles are there in your routine research work which you did not have before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure doesn &apos;t comply with standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import from other countries .
G@@ V : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there are already interest but only a very limit@@ ing understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods are taught in schools to improve the situation .
G@@ V : how big is your opinion the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they focus on , and how can we support the development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there is need of special scientific training , beginning at any age .
social sciences , computer science , big data , research of space , health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and cont@@ ag@@ ious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit .
G@@ V : can you describe the pros and cons of life as scientists in Africa compared to Western countries , based on your experience ?
RW : it is often the limited speed , things to do , and the general access to scientific expertise , which are present here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the system that magazines are only accessible against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , also limited the amount of available information and the speed of research . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the USA to India : how &quot; open source &quot; seed producers change global food production
this post by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine which reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mort@@ on has been a salad since the 1980s in the USA .
its company provides 114 varieties , such as out@@ red@@ ded , the first plant , which were grown and consumed by NASA ast@@ ron@@ au@@ ts in space .
for almost 20 years , Mort@@ on &apos;s work was given only by its own inhal@@ ation and the question of how many oint@@ ments can get , limits .
but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s , he noticed that more sal@@ ads were patented and that he could not continue to bre@@ w them for bre@@ eders .
patents are not only available for individual types , but also for certain properties like resistance to ill@@ nesses , a special red or green or cro@@ oked leaves .
over the past few years more such patents have been filed for more plants such as grain or cart@@ ot@@ ten@@ ds . due to these trends , plant bre@@ eders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and expert food safety provide food security for the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia @-@ old tradition , Mort@@ on still bre@@ eds salad , however , it takes longer than ever since its work is still more difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is as if a b@@ oul@@ ders would lie in a river , in order to p@@ add@@ ling it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we have to do that now , but it is a bre@@ ach with the breeding tradition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think these patents will go far too far . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if they stand before judgment , no one can breed a new salad , because all features are patented . &quot; it is as good as possible and tries to compens@@ ate for those features which he wants .
however , he is very careful and tries to use no material that is protected as intellectual property .
he has also joined a movement that is getting bigger in the USA and all over the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; ) .
ast@@ ron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and ate red Rö@@ mer@@ sal@@ at in the &quot; greenhouse &quot; of the station . it is tested where plants can be grown in space .
photo : NASA
it is no co@@ incidence that this name sounds rather as if the movement origin@@ ates from the IT area and not from the field of plant breeding .
the open source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative für &quot; Open @-@ Source &quot; seed ) can be inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software , alternatives to copyright protected software .
it was launched in order to ensure that some plant types and -@@ gens may not be protected as intellectual property and can be used for plant bre@@ eders permanently .
as part of the initiative , called O@@ ss@@ i , US bre@@ eders can commit to that others can use the seed @-@ free seed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , this does not mean that they do not continue to do with their seed and sell it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bre@@ eders allow to cross their seed to make such own varieties , and it does not immediately explo@@ it - two aspects that are prohibited by many plant pat@@ rons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
dozens of bre@@ eders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014 .
dis@@ mal prospects
the emer@@ itus professor of the University of Wisconsin @-@ Madison and O@@ ss@@ i board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are control of seeds and the possibility to breeding new plants , both important for food security and environmental protection .
seeds plays a role in larger co@@ hes@@ ions like biodiversity , rights of farmers , control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bre@@ eders would try to use the latter not or only little by using seeds with natural resi@@ li@@ ence .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg emphas@@ ises that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement does not work with gene@@ tically modified plants .
all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , gene@@ tically modified or not , from organic farming or not . &quot; in order to purchase our goal of ecological sustainability , we need to take control of ecological farming , such as such as farmers markets , should also know that the way it is bred to farmers markets , such as this vegetable is bred .
nutritional so@@ vereign without seed sovereignty is not possible . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed initiative are committed to providing other seed remain freely available . thus , their approach is to be patented in contrast , seed and plant features . &quot; &quot; &quot;

O@@ ss@@ i supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk , as the available gene pool is due to the always numerous mental intellectual property rights to plant material , which is therefore always restricted .
Claire Lu@@ by , Executive Director of O@@ ss@@ i , has engaged in her PhD with gen@@ ius variation in carrots and their availability . she found out that about one @-@ third of all cart@@ ons is protected as intellectual property , which means that it can either be used for plant bre@@ eders either or not only .
there are still such estimates for other plants , but experts like Lu@@ by susp@@ ect that mass plants like wheat in even greater style are patented as let@@ tu@@ ce or carrots .
a Question Of Vis@@ ions
plants are so bred that they have targeted characteristics - from such , by which their flavor or its colour improves , due to those in certain environments flour@@ ish and ri@@ pen@@ sions such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for bre@@ eders is increasing by more and more patents . however , genetic variety is currently more necessary than ever before , since the changing conditions are much worse .
in an e @-@ mail , Monsanto &apos;s spokesperson in Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to acknowledge that genetic variety is generally important and also important for Monsanto &apos;s activities . with a total of four comra@@ des and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States , the company is committed to maintaining genetic variety .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , you will contra@@ dict that intellectual property calls on other bre@@ eders as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patents and the protection of plant vari@@ etal innovations &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; a patent is basically a plan that anyone can follow once the patent has exp@@ ired . &quot; &quot; &quot;
often these instructions help others to come with another method for the same result .
such protection does not in@@ hi@@ bits innovation , but promotes more material and know @-@ how to be made available to the public . &quot;
Mort@@ on looks different : 20 years for waiting , until a patent can abl@@ ish , makes certainly no innovations .
and if you have to wait so long to breeding plants that are adapted to the changed environment conditions , you have already lost the battle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the main argument for Mort@@ on is , however , that genetic resources have always been a common good and should remain : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; independent plant bre@@ eders neither have the time nor money for such form@@ alities , and monetary inc@@ enti@@ ves are not attractive to us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want farmers to make their work easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is what drives us , and it will be impossible for us if we do not continue to use the best and newest genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in total , Mort@@ on is trying to patented the concept of the concept : &quot; we do not really create the features .
the plants form it themselves and as bre@@ eders we have no idea how the plants do it .
a secret of nature . &quot;
for Carol Dep@@ pe , plant bre@@ eders in the U.S. state , Oregon and O@@ ss@@ i board member , there is another important aspect of the plant breeding : &quot; those who breed a variety can also bre@@ ach their own values in them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mon@@ ocular cultures , for whose cultivation are needed her@@ bic@@ ide , bre@@ eds in its varieties of agriculture . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my concept is very opposite . &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such people move on international markets , but smaller than e.g. Monsanto are ) patents , create the most smaller seed companies , even without patents , either reject it or keep it for too expensive and therefore not re@@ warding or both is the case .
the independent plant breeding Frank Mort@@ on is looking for sal@@ ads in his breeding garden .
photo by Karen Mort@@ on .
Mort@@ on is the view that Bre@@ eders would avoid innovative bre@@ eders by avoiding plant pat@@ rons : &quot; it looks like I am with my efforts to produce new , stronger than companies that patented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I need new material for my catalogue , since I know my competitors are protected my varieties in a couple of years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one patent is protected for 20 years ahead of competition , with what you think of my opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; global resonance &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the USA seem to be a leader in the &quot; open source &quot; breeding , the concept now spreads rapidly throughout the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) describes itself as a professional organisation in the area of resources , an &quot; open @-@ source &quot; seed program works with farmers and helps them meet new varieties which meet certain requirements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also supports them to come to &quot; Open Source &quot; seed and sell their own .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German organisation Agre@@ ements is working on an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open @-@ source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; license which ultimately is a formal and legally binding form of the O@@ ss@@ i commitment to bre@@ eders in the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( rules for bre@@ eders differ from country to country , absent for O@@ ss@@ i &apos;s obligation not to be one of one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive branch of the European Union , the European Commission declar@@ es that conven@@ tionally , plants should not be patented . thus , they are allowed against the current practice of the European Patent Office , which allows patents on conventional bred plants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , there is no law yet ; now it is to governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in October 2016 the Dutch organisation H@@ iv@@ os organised a conference on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ethiopia , on the farmers , operators of seed companies and seed companies from all over East Africa to learn something about the &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend towards pat@@ ent@@ ing seed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; program , explains that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seed systems , for the planned next year of the official start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a merger between environmental and development groups ( among them H@@ iv@@ os , the international non@@ profit development organization US@@ C Canada and the action group on ero@@ sion , technology and concentration - Action Group on ero@@ sion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database for seed and biodiversity around the world , to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed @-@ map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Essen@@ es - a ban and aid organisations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - represents the possibility to exchange and improve seed policies , so that a stable supply can be ensured with food .
in the report also emphas@@ izes the importance of a diverse , local supply with seed for sustainable food systems - a connection , by the Lu@@ by of O@@ ss@@ i , hopes to see him soon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods has hardly been cultivated , and seed @-@ systems have hardly played a role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now try to clear the people that even more behind her food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest goals of c@@ ens@@ orship in Egypt
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still unlock the Egyptian authorities content on the Internet . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ ni@@ est .
on the weekend of August 5th , the Egyptian government closed the website of the Arabic network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ TE@@ I ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world , and reports them above them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; August published the network a statement on Facebook , in which the Egyptian authorities crit@@ ically critic@@ ized this step , and promised to continue the work and efforts of human rights in the region . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Arabic network for Human Rights Information remains consistent despite this attack and the violation of the Egyptian law and the Constitution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if there was never so difficult to overcome this goals , so it was never so important to overcome these goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first cen@@ sored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt , after the authorities blocked over two months of 21 websites , such as the independent news page MA@@ DA Mas@@ r , Arabic @-@ language edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , and that of Qatar , Al Jazeera , because of alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organisation of the wave of web side barriers to the victim . @ an@@ hr@@ i one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language htt@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / N@@ IZ@@ A Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
beside AN@@ I , there is no access to Egypt &apos;s blog of colum@@ ni@@ sts and human rights studies Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada .
Zi@@ ada used his blog for the spread of colum@@ n@@ ics and articles that he writes not accessible websites and media in Egypt .
now the blog , who built it in order to handle the Zen@@ sen system of the Egyptian government , even target an attack .
blo@@ gger , the provider who is also home to Zi@@ adas blog , is further accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity , having been arrested by Egyptian security forces , while he reported on the student gu@@ este and recorded a video as the police executed physical violence against two students .
his articles are mainly concerned about politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada said to the lock by the government and reflected what this means to him :
the fact , blogs is very old , but has a priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ att@@ ah al @-@ S@@ isi ; and even if the sh@@ it of blogs is not important for the world , it is for two reasons for me :
1 ) It is successful to give me the feeling of an siege resistance ; A arrest , a su@@ re@@ ty murder , un@@ loading at the National Security Council , the spar@@ ing blogs , and any other web site for which I worked .
2 ) You have proved that I did not wrote in vain . in other words , my words have influence , although only a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first , I used it to item articles to handle the c@@ ens@@ orship .
however , after they have locked it and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the samples are going through the way up to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( AF@@ TE ) , Egyptian authorities blocked all technical tests on the networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , among others Orange , Vod@@ af@@ one and Et@@ is@@ al@@ at .
AF@@ TE also documented the lock of providers by fe@@ aring the internet c@@ ens@@ orship and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
AF@@ TE reported in her research :
on Monday , June 12th we noticed how the lock of web pages that V@@ P@@ N@@ s started .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such practice indicates the intention of the government to continue to block content and to filter , to access the Egyptian users . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the situation is additionally wor@@ sen@@ ed that the cen@@ sored links are made behind closed doors , whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis , with which they can proceed in court against these actions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with c@@ ens@@ orship and who will attack them next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants argue .

day for day newspapers in Brazil with devast@@ ating head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard shows .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot in school &quot; Every second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro was killed , &quot; Th@@ ie@@ ves smoke pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; President T@@ emer sends 8@@ 500 Sol@@ di@@ ers of the Army , Marine and Air Force to Rio . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the middle of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the competition in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the United Nations Brazilian non @-@ governmental organisation called for the United Nations to interven@@ e .
reports like these are all daily and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; find at least the manager of a local newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus , for the detailed reporting on violence in Rio known newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Extra &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published on August 16 , the Editorial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is not normal &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which they announced a new heading called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; war in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all reports on violence in the city are now published there .
the motives for their decision declared the newspaper so :
extra will continue to report about crimes that happen in every big city in the world like murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexu@@ ality , etc . everything that happens in Rio will be published in the heading &quot; war in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative to allow us to exclu@@ de our eyes than journalists from the cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four @-@ minute video shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , the editor of the newspaper , said that this decision was not an occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure :
extra is probably the only newspaper on the whole world with a war ru@@ bri@@ k in a country that doesn &apos;t recognize the war .
in the same video , a journalist of the newspaper explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro 8@@ 43 territ@@ ories , they are controlled by criminal organisations .
in the Editorial , the paper continues to write :
us is aware that a war dis@@ course , if it is dist@@ orted , can also be used to mis@@ use cru@@ ises of the police , who only e@@ ats and then ask questions to dis@@ gu@@ ise .
but we defend the war based on information and fight against corruption in the police , whose objective is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the Mafia and its partners .
does the term &quot; war &quot; harm more than they use ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ cept Brasil , the journalist Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira addressed the violence as a &quot; war . &quot; this is their opinion a just@@ ification of the failed security policy by the media and might be difficult to make responsible persons responsible for the police .
this is no war .
this is the result of corruption and worse planning - as extra in the analysis of military interest rates in Rio has shown - in combination with in@@ sufficient investment in personnel , recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance and a historical and compl@@ ac@@ ent neg@@ lect of public service .
to remember : the state of Rio de Janeiro is greater than its capital .

&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Cec@@ í@@ lia , Rio de Janeiro is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most violent place in Brazil , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent towns in Brazil were lying in the north and north @-@ east of the country . these are the most current data available . &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of these cities are located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
if we look at the M@@ ord@@ backs per state , Rio is at number 16 , &quot; she writes .
extra belongs to the company Glob@@ o , the largest media company in South America that emphas@@ izes the security policy of the State for years .
these safety policy measures also included the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia Pac@@ if@@ ic@@ ad@@ ora ) , one of the federal state of Rio in 2003 , whose aim is to capture a fav@@ ela by using a massive police ban and to en@@ roll a unit permanently there .
in the beginning , this was actually lead to a decline of violent deaths . for several years , U@@ PP has resulted in a number of reports on ch@@ ic@@ ans and re@@ pres@@ sions against poor con@@ greg@@ ations which should actually protect the newly created police unit , increasingly under decision .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on his Facebook page , the journalist João Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux escaped from one of his articles from 2010 , in which he explains why the violence in Rio does not comply with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; civil war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; criteria . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he writes :
aside from legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as war suggests a serious consequences for people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because this calls for the state to use means and ways that are typical for a war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it belongs to the territory of an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enemy &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is a sharp point in the landscape and for the object for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; abandoned balls &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
war or after , fact is that the inhabitants of the fav@@ elas will continue to suffer from Rio .
a week it is now that police arrive with the Fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho mountain in order to av@@ enge the death of a police officer .
in the midst of all these violence , this incident was head@@ lines : a fruit basket died as a result of shots which had fired the police from a helicopter .

since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the following civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and block@@ ades , mostly by the Assad regime against loy@@ alist troops .
according to the Siege Watch , a joint initiative of the Peace Organization PA@@ X and the research institute The Syria Institute , located in Damascus and Um@@ land , Homs , D@@ eir E@@ zz@@ or and Id@@ lib about one million Syrians in a state of siege .
especially strongly is the East Gh@@ out@@ a region , where an attack with chemical weapons called the life of hundreds of civilians on 21 August 2013 .
many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition , are based on the basis of investigations of the United Nations and other human rights bodies , that the massacre of the Assad regime was committed .
since 2013 , these rebels have been controlled by under siege under siege under siege under siege under the siege of Damascus , which led people on the loc@@ o or from tunnel and control points of mu@@ g@@ gled foods .
by years of block@@ ade , traditional foods such as meat have become un@@ att@@ ain@@ able for large parts of the population .
as a counter@@ part , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and ac@@ adem@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , as they can plant their own mushrooms as &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot;
they themselves call themselves Gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ nah@@ da and lead the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
fung@@ i do not belong to the traditional , planted foods in Syria and are only very rarely part of the Syrian cuisine . however , their food makes them an attractive food source for many residents of besie@@ ged East Gh@@ out@@ a .
the direc@@ ting of the project , subscription Nabil , said to the AF@@ P &apos;s French news agency :
&quot; we chose the cultivation of fung@@ i because they have a high nutritional value , similar to flesh , and because they can plant them in houses and cell@@ ars . &quot;
Dr. Ahmed Le@@ ila , one of the organiz@@ ers , reported Global Vo@@ ices , that has been fighting for three years , this project is known and expressed its relief that it is now more and more &quot; gain popularity . &quot;
to collect money for the initiative , in consultation with the NGO Gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ nah@@ da the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do .
it is planned to mediate 125 families of knowledge of the plant@@ ing of fung@@ i , as Dr. Le@@ ila to Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the constitution of this article , they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of about 12.@@ 700 € , but will continue to collect donations to Can@@ Do on Monday 04 September 2017 .
the initiative is dependent on generators who keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity of 80 % .
owing to the fuel scar@@ city , locally produced raw materials are used to supply generators using the necessary energy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Le@@ ila said Global Vo@@ ices , that they began with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Production from the Regions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before they checked out their quality and if they are suitable for consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
afterwards they planted a small Pil@@ z@@ hof in a tub . as this succeeded , they used a larger tub . and so on .
now they designed a &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed mushrooms throughout the East Gh@@ out@@ a free of charge .
Dr. Le@@ ila declared that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach humans the fungus in various reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; break the siege . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to spread this idea around the world , making our success as well as our fight against hunger and siege . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experience people in crisis regions and we can help humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Portuguese calls for justice to the victims of the fires of 2017
several hundred people protest@@ ed on 21 October in many districts in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of fires , which led to the north of Portugal in the week .
forty @-@ two persons died , and approximately 70 were injured following the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this led the government last week out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days a state of State .
fires were also registered in the Gal@@ icia region in Spain , where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire bur@@ sts that spread themselves in the northern and centrally located regions of the country and reaches about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June , a similar tragedy happened in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , where the fires of 64 deaths and more than 200 injured .
according to the European forest surveillance system , which monitors the forest areas by satellite TV alone , in Portugal only approx . 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal - an area of the area &apos;s size in Lisbon .
so that you can make a better image of Ernst of the location : there is no fire in 4 bor@@ ou@@ ghs .

people asked themselves why civil protection was not capable of com@@ bing the tragedy of tragedy as far as possible .
João So@@ ver@@ al of the Federation of the Far@@ mers of Portugal declared the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
after Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão streets and villages were evacu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
this Sunday they did nowhere : there are dozens of open roads that were surrounded by fire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy happened in June , as the streets were closed very late . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , construction permits are required in locations with high fire .
an extensive proposal for the wh@@ ale shape , introduced by the government after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was objec@@ tion@@ less by the mun@@ icipalities that saw new rules as an obst@@ acle to investment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government led a loos@@ ening of the law , which had the construction activity of the case allowed if the applic@@ ant could be built on means of self @-@ protection , so that all could be built &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; João Sor@@ val leads further on the same article in the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Quer@@ cus has pointed out that large surfaces with eu@@ calyp@@ tus trees made from slightly combust@@ ible wood , rises , as in a v@@ icious circle , still wide spread to fires of this species .
in addition to these problems , the website of the civil protection from Portugal on 15 and 16 October , as a resident of information , sought or tried to contact members offline .
it was a private initiative , which provided the population with information , using f@@ og@@ os@@ .@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires .
the project was launched by the developer of João P@@ ina in 2015 to simpli@@ fy the work of fire brig@@ ade in October so that the servers did not follow the ons@@ lau@@ ght of 400@@ ,000 users who did not with@@ stand the fires , the site attracted more than half a million .
even the founder asked for help :

in a night in autumn 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan began in Afghanistan .
two years ago , a terrible civil war broke out between the different Mu@@ ja@@ he@@ din groups who had defeated the short @-@ term pro @-@ Soviet government . Afghanistan has become a country of terror and despair .
at this time A@@ shar@@ k Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in Central Europe for the last time with his family at dinner .
even if his mother didn &apos;t say it then , she knew she would not see her son much longer - maybe even more .
in the morning , the boy was to break up .
his uncle would pick him up and bring it to the tow@@ age .

Abdul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the Has@@ ara dominated party , He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat , was just murdered by the Taliban and suddenly many Haz@@ ara felt troubled .
the Taliban as well as Haz@@ ara known Taliban were ever closer to their hatred .
many Haz@@ ara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ k found himself in Pakistan .
for a few years he worked in a coal mine . the work was hard and made him ill .
then he took what was left of his small salary , and went to Iran . once again he found himself in a foreign country along with other refugees and s@@ lugg@@ ish sacks with mort@@ ars , which were harder than he himself to earn his li@@ vel@@ ih@@ ood .
back then , as today , the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was characterized by mis@@ ery and exploitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was really hard , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ k re@@ minded of an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we ( Afghan refugees ) lived in an empty building on the building site , which we also worked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no service there and no heating . we hung nylon in front of the open windows , so that we do not tum@@ our at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ k made his life without papers in Iran and ready for the journey to Europe .
during the dangerous crossing of the sea , he suffered ship@@ wreck and stran@@ ded on a small , un@@ inhabited island .
after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum request , A@@ shar@@ k moved to Italy in 2002 .
some time A@@ shar@@ k was homeless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks , and went to a church dedicated to food twice a day food .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is true that Italy is a kind of second chance for exp@@ elled asylum seek@@ ers . it is true , however , that the conditions that asylum seek@@ ers can be found in the country cat@@ astroph@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Civil Organization Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system &quot; suff@@ ers from a general lack of transparency .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the large majority of the asylum seek@@ ers is housed in more than 3000 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; admission centers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the more than 3000 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; admission centers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Italian law asylum seek@@ ers can only be allocated to a admission center , if they have officially put an application for asylum - which can be taken for months after the registry of the asylum seek@@ er .
until then , people who have no cash for an accommodation either on the hospitality of friends or need to sleep on the street .
so it was also A@@ shar@@ k .
but his un@@ sh@@ ame@@ ful lifestyle helped A@@ shar@@ k to liber@@ ate yourself from these conditions .
after he had made different work in the construction industry for several years , A@@ shar@@ k put all the savings into the creation of a hostel in Venice .
this was so good that after a while , he opened a second hostel and a fast limb@@ o .
shar@@ k Bar@@ atis success story is now topic of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( german : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) director Am@@ in Wah@@ id@@ i .
the film won the Venice City Award in 2017 , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepren@@ eurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
a lot of bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles .
according to in@@ official estimates , some 20,000 Afghan women live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a trans@@ itional solution in the way to other European countries .
during recent years , some of Afghanistan @-@ operated companies , including tail@@ or , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent food .
in Venice Ham@@ ed Ah@@ mad@@ i had the idea of his restaurant Oriental Experience , in which the wa@@ iter and kitchen staff were mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of restaurants is told by the various Afghan , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek courts , the history of their journey to Italy .
the Afghan entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Padua as peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the Pizzeria Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na in Bologna and a s@@ ushi restaurant in Rome .
however , A@@ shar@@ af@@ s aims far beyond the Italian food industry and retail stores and aim back to the country that he forced to leave a teen@@ ager .
&quot; where a risk is , there are options , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ k with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan .
I have never forgotten my country , and I can &apos;t live happy if I know my people suffer .
I plan a project for farmers from the p@@ oo@@ rest provinces of the country , especially for women .
they represent half of the society and must get the same options as all others . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ k also plans plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul in which people can learn packaging and preser@@ ving techniques . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , they can sell their appoin@@ tments on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the development to the successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through un@@ certainty and doubt , but at the end there is stability and prosperity .
A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey itself . now he wants to help other Afghan people .
Ne@@ ti@@ zers : bills of Egypt allow social networking of social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , for more than 900 days in detention .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Egyptian Parliament checks a bill that allows users to use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after regist@@ ering a government authority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
users would need to be able to use social networks within six months after the succ@@ es@@ ful Legisl@@ ative Dec@@ ision on the website of the authority , giving their full name as well as their ID number .
those who failed this step could be sentenced to up to six months of imprisonment or the end of a penalty .
the law , which was advert@@ ised by sixty par@@ liament@@ arians , lies on the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and should be deb@@ ated there .
in May another Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties filed a legislative proposal , in the tou@@ g@@ her pen@@ alties for the ins@@ ult of the President or a high public officials .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Egyptian law is already pun@@ ish@@ able by the presi@@ dents of the President as well as state institutions . under the legislative proposal , such a deed would be pun@@ ish@@ able with prison and monetary pen@@ alties , such right experts of the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
should the law be passed , this can mean up to three years in prison for the convicted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , this would open a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of freedom has already been in danger since many years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud subscription Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested by Egyptian polic@@ emen while demonstr@@ ating violence towards demonstr@@ ators who demonstrated violence towards demonstr@@ ators who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the counter@@ feit President Mohammed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan waited so much more than 700 Protest@@ ants that were arrested in the same incident , four years in prison on a court date .
recently , his trial was post@@ pon@@ ed to the 20th May , because the prison sentence led to human rights groups to prevent the accused of prison in the cour@@ tro@@ om .
Sha@@ w@@ kan is threat@@ ening the death penalty due to a , so many human rights groups agree , head@@ lights of other weapons , illegal assembly , murder and su@@ cking murder .
in another case , a Criminal Court in G@@ iza spoke the two journalist H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were charged for their reporting on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya in Cairo .
the court also reduced the pen@@ alties of the journalists Abdullah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested in the previous incident , from 25 years to 5 years .
Tunis@@ ian activists to be passed through documents
in May , Tunis@@ ian authorities spent six hours with the inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation of Sami Ben G@@ har@@ bia , who co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at as well as the Global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia was primarily endor@@ sed by the President of the Republic , which was explicitly endor@@ sed by the President of the Republic , the business@@ men and during the former regime through dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali due to corruption accused am@@ nesty , if they returned all un@@ just@@ i@@ ously preserved gel@@ ding .
the document published on April 21 on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at , th@@ rows a light on how the splendid plans to support the bill .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia rejected the nam@@ ing of his sources , indic@@ ating Article 11 of the Tunis@@ ian press release , which journalists gave the right to protect their sources .
nevertheless , he joined the Tunis District Court on May 09 as a witness in the case .
will China force social media to submit their identification ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the new regulations of the People &apos;s Republic of China , social media in China require a permit to write or share messages in social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the regulations it is also stated that registration will be required with the full real name .
analysts dis@@ courage that this should be reached by the elim@@ ination of anonymous comments within social networks . it is now un@@ clear how authorities use these rules .
Chinese nation@@ alities suggested in social media , to asser@@ t these regulations only sel@@ ec@@ tively , to protect citizens journ@@ alism and independence .
then let &apos;s see in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
may locked the state c@@ ens@@ orship of Russia the access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat .
according to Ros@@ kom@@ n@@ ad@@ z@@ or We@@ Chat , referring to the state government as &quot; organis@@ er of the information distribution . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this name is part of a law from 2014 , thanks to whom the Russian government introduces a list of online services that enables the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; release of information &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; the law also allows the administration to make responsible for removing content and force them on request for the removal of user data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these websites are currently among websites such as V@@ kontak@@ te and Od@@ no@@ classi@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two popular social networks ) , the image board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the e @-@ mail service mail@@ .ru and dozens of other services .
Turkish court dispos@@ es of lock Wikipedi@@ as
a Turkish court had the lock Wikipedi@@ as in Turkey after Wikipedia administ@@ rators refused to delete two English @-@ language articles , which support Turkey support the jihadists in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , maritime Affairs and Communication gave birth to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a source of information that co@@ operates with groups to escal@@ ate a political diff@@ usion campaign against Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first time that Turkey has blocked the website completely . it is thus far from China , one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible .
UK can &apos;t stop trying to mu@@ ff@@ les
following this week , the British government is located in the midst of a targeted consultation on increased surveillance authority , which would force internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and install back@@ door programs to de@@ cryp@@ t data encryption .
however , the government has cons@@ ulted the t@@ elecommun@@ ications company and intelligence services regarding the proposal , but has left other technology companies and the civilian population .
in spite of this , the consultation will continue until 19 May . reactions and suggestions by members of the public can be for@@ warded to the Ministry of Interior .
