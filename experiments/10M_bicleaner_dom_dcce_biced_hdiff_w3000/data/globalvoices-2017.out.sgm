<seg id="1">Although I had visited the USA since 2012 at least once a year, I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love of America is extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="4">How many of my generation grew up with American movies, I have danced American music and operated by American authors.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had a profound effect on me that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film.</seg>
<seg id="6">As a 14-year-old I saw the great Denzel Washington, like he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican's letter, a fearless reporter, who made his attention inclined with Julia Roberts as a Jura-Student, who were the Supreme Court of Justice who had his interest to occupy.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "freely to Method One," "" "It was as if that's the absolute Truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona, my admiration for the USA was only strengthened.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "I always said:" "" "America is the only country where I ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting you can always be that you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of equal people." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had a very shy love letter about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">A lot was written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most unusual aspect of his ascension is for me as he is dealing with his dewdness.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never keeps his mind behind the mountain, as you say so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he thinks about how a former colleague repressed, and explains publicly his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, AfroAmerican and Women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, people responded to their statements and voted in droves for him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won in the republican elections, was the highest number ever achieved by the party.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigot person, I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not make Trump and his voters in accordance with the people I met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">As for example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism program, taking people from all over the world, with whom I could talk about Islam and its past.</seg>
<seg id="23">Trumps Weltanschauung did not agree with Peter Bhatia, the current editor of the "Cincinnati Inquirer," which is the present editor.</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to watch the "Phoenix Suns" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trumps Intolerance is also in contrast to the generosity that I had with Sandy Bahr, who fought for their lives long the environment, and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me like their son.</seg>
<seg id="26">She is still adapting to the engagement of Kristi Kappes, which always helped me to get used to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then, there were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors who helped me a lot in my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and they embodied in them deepened my love of America.</seg>
<seg id="29">As Trump left his way to the nominated Republican Presidency, they offered me a stop and counterpart in his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, it turned out that they were the exception of rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On 8 November 2016, over 50 million Americans, mostly white, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps just because of his contempt against non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The confrontation with the idea that humans have voted for trump, because they were distributed either to racism and fanaticism, because they were willing to oversee these things, nearly broke my heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Maybe it is unfair to call the trump voter than Rassigh.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "the people," "" "said one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and respectful and implies an inability to understand those who act in another way and think.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows the people that their worries and fears are not taken into account of the hectic changes in their communities.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that those voters, of which most white are tuned for trump, because they want to regain control over a country that has disappointed them?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they may say that they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who comments the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contempt upon those who look different.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "this" "" "whitelash" "" "(indication of the White People against all other ethnicities; word game from white in play on the White and whiplash, which means as much as Schleudertrauma), as it was the great Van Jones called, exactly what is so great." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality, it is still a powerful idea - what faith or background you like, America is everyone welcome.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country chose as its president, twice the son of an Kenianer, his story as he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible.</seg>
<seg id="44">With the election Donald Trumps, however, gives a huge proportion of the white Americas that promise to and say: hell with diversity, religious freedom and the whole concept of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11 the white man is back on Ruder, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">With all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier, who fell in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">At a rally for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, if my son, captain Humayun Kahn, would have a place in your America?" Mr. Khan asked.</seg>
<seg id="49">The crowd answered with a loud "No!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" the crowd was roared.</seg>
<seg id="52">"have Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">No! "they answered them.</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" they cried and their voices were loud.</seg>
<seg id="56">"if anyone who is not like you, is a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a unanimous and vocable "NO"!</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan concluded with the words: "thank God, Mr. Trump, isn't that your America." 36 hours later he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The land for which his son fell, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is now Trumps Country, the news said.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people that look like Mr. Khan, could not find any place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And this breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of Vicente Guerrero congregation in the province of Oaxaca, together with the children of the paraguaean city of Cateura?</seg>
<seg id="70">The music that is played in both places, not only the life of children, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music, which lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump, just 16 km south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial town that is very popular among tourists, but the worlds away from nearby precolonies and its world-famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For several years, La Banda de Música (music bande) plays in the community: one of the children and adults of existing symphony orchestra, which has been found with their musical instruments, an opportunity for overcoming poverty.</seg>
<seg id="74">A school school with 100 students for the community of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca became a central interest.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The community that is located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico is known for its drug abuse and gangs.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a random encounter with a French pilots who started a musical project and the youth offered so rare hopelessly.</seg>
<seg id="78">Young band members take their obligations very seriously compared to the music group, says the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:</seg>
<seg id="79">Once they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They always come laughing and playing with shiny eyes and play in the chest you meet day for trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, timpani, Bongos and the Conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from trash</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometers south of Vicente Guerrero are the children of Cateura - a village located at the top of the largest garbage dump of Asuncion in Paraguay, on instruments that are made from recycled waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with replenished instruments made from local firm waste materials, produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recycler have begun under the baton of Favio Chávez with them to transform parts of decay into instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments imitate violins, viola, celli, contrabass, guitar, flutes, trumpets, trumpets, trumpets, trumpets, trumpets and drums.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music as well as the Beatles music, by Frank Sinatra, etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article in the Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez, a local environmental scholar and music teacher of the children of Cateura, at the initial time:</seg>
<seg id="87">At first it was very difficult because we had no place to rehearse and we had to teach in the same place where the parents had no music and it was very difficult to contact us because many of them do not live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">That changed as Favio something that he had never seen before: a violin made of waste.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today, there is a whole orchestra which plays on instruments from replenished material and is called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic garbage dump) shows the musical performance on:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world produces about one billion metric tons of rubbish every year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and of him are the Trouble - like men in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn him into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra with its inspiring play of trash-to-music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra even played his music before Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These ostAfrican countries show how technology and teamwork can fight illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that fights wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that targeted solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">The restation happens in the context of an agreement with Global Voices for the common use of Content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa, it was known that this ship had already run illegal fishing waters before finding the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were raised accordingly, and slightly inclined to welcome a lawsuit of this kind in their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the comore, Mozambique and the Seychelles mobilized quickly against the ship. they refused to buy one of its harbours and refused to share a fishing agency.</seg>
<seg id="103">"suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries which simply refused to do everything," he remembers Benedict Kiilu, a leading employee of the Kenyan fisheries agency. he is part of a team that discovered and followed the ship.</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013 the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region: it wasn't succeeded to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">Finally, it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia, due to pillaging the country's fish stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The nucleus of this initiative, which protects criminal practices and protects resources was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NRO stop illegal Fishing (Illegal Fishing stop).</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network are the six countries in addition to Somalia and Madagascar, who then displaced the Premier from their waters.</seg>
<seg id="108">"we have eight countries that are consistent and working together. they exchange information and stand each other when it comes to illegal fishing," says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trusts project Ending illegally Fishing. this project offers FISH-i technical support.</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught is hidden, absent because it is extremely difficult to locate it. thus illegal fishing is a leading cause of overfishing of regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">Due to the obvious miscontempt of existing laws, using those specific habitats and types are to harm the illegal fishing ecosystem, which have a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while actions against illegal fishing were hindered by bureaucratic hurdles, and also through the snowflempo, with the information between individual countries, so the actions happen in real time, with traceable to FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There, individual countries, for example, can exchange lists of existing licenses, news on suspicious activities or details that you had noticed or experienced during a port inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i tracks the activities of ships also very attentive, if they move on the open sea, using satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This allows the authorities to mark the ships that fish in forbidden areas. there are also such suspicious driving routes - such that a ship invites its caught fish on the way to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such examinations indicate whether the participating ships have a fish catch license where they were traveling and possibly even if they have a criminal register.</seg>
<seg id="116">"" "" "" "countries who are against illegal fishing, can then refuse to the assumption of such ships in their harbours. what means that the ships cannot sell their cargo. and that they may even be forced to pay punishments, as in the case of the Premier." ""</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "then it's about considerable financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is not worthwhile." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">"" "and that is what we want to achieve," "" "says Per Erik Bergh, executive director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a Bering company which is committed to fight illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The already mentioned platform was created to gain an estimated $20 million to lost revenue, which are losing eight members of the network HISH-i every year due to Illegal Fischer, who penetrate the East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has become one of the most productive tuna fishing companies, which attracts the region's commercial fishing trades from around the world. among these also illegal fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">Among other practices, actions include like sailing under false flag, fake licensing documents, stating phantasselseeds, fish protected species and fish in protected areas.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "they use the lack of international cooperation and take advantage of the weaknesses of a non complete organised control system," "" "says Long." "" "in the past, a ship was illegally fishing and a country could say" "" "You must not walk down my harbour." ""</seg>
<seg id="124">But another country could say 'Komm to me'. "and exactly this legal end hole tries to close FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="125">So far the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i was involved in more than 30 examinations of suspected ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has been revealed criminal networks that had counterfeit licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships used by several fraudulent identities and has been pursuing it.</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to his cooperation with Interpol, the international authority on the fight of crimes, FISH-i can share information about illegal fishing over large distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime," says Bergh.</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that will help FISH-i suspects even more precise ships.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which is always developed further, also helps to hide the illegal boats.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "" "" "illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position," "" "Duncan Copeland, Head analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, a NRO, which also deals with fisheries data and FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships, for example, turn their automatic identification systems, with which they can no longer be ordered by satellite.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland helps to build a system that connects different information of information. it should help FISH-i to find criminational ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But FISH-i's team can actually influence African nations's global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO skyTruth, believes that.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth has opened jointly with Google and the Marine Protection Agency Oceana the Platform Global Fishing Watch: a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed worldwide by the position of each individual traceable ship worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "" "" "accumulate with the neighbors to get a better image of what is doing." "" "this is simply sense," "" "he says." "" "here is a chance for countries to unite and exploit their resources." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "we should do this on global level." "" "Pew Charitable Trusts has a similar project with which a global system allows the prosecution of ships." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities do not only detect criminals, but also locusts them.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships who confiscated without license and had hardly to reckon with consequences, know that they are observing.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the participating countries took part in FISH-i by a 33% increase in fisheries, since fisher boats sold more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After having helped by FISH-i Somalia, Greko 1 found the detectors on board tow-nets, whose use is prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"" "other countries are noticing this successes." "" "the effect is so strong that we now even copy other countries," "" "says Kiilu." "" "in West Africa, several hundred million dollars will disappear every year by illegal fishing." ""</seg>
<seg id="148">"" "there have joined six countries in 2015, to the so-called West Africa Task Force." "" "they now fight illegal fishing, following precisely the same model as FISH-i." "" "safety is the aim of making even more such initiatives and structures in other regions," "" "says Copeland." ""</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently, FISH-i's youngest member country Somalia was able to report his first great triumph: in October there was Greko 1, a ship which was travelling under a false flag. and not only was the ship used without a license and were not allowed to use towing nets.</seg>
<seg id="150">"" "the ship was also covered in forbidden waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "" "with the take of action against Greko 1, they put a strong sign that they proceed against illegal fishing catch," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i this is another success from many. and at the same time, the evidence that works such a collaborative working way to protect the oceans. Emma Bryce is a freelance journalist and lives in London. she writes on the subject of the environment, technology and nutrition.</seg>

<seg id="197">This is an adapted version of the interviews from Alejo Gómez with Luis Quijano which was published on 23 August 2016 in Día a Día, a Argentine news page.</seg>
<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and published here with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father to visit the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentine city Córdoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">As an adult man, Quijano now said within the framework of the Great La Perla-Ribera process in the province of Cordoba, against his father.</seg>
<seg id="201">The trial, which ended on 24 August 2016, were examined by crimes committed during the Argentinean military dictatorship.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano did not choose his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Starting at the brush, the same name as his father carry up to the brutal military operations in La Perla prison, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">He kept the family secret for 34 years.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation, I thought that was fine.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret magician.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child with 15 years you don't notice that you are manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">I could not realise that my father was a thief, folterer and murderer.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis had no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was Gendarmeriebeamers. during the Argentinean military dictatorship of 1974 till 1983, a time of state terrorism, his father from 1976 to 1978 was Deputy Commander of the Secret Services Division 141 at La Perla prison.</seg>

<seg id="212">This is not the story of Luis Quijano, the oppressors who is accused of abduction in 158 cases, torture, murder in almost 100 cases and abduction of a 10 year old child.</seg>
<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quijanos's son, a man who had witnessed over the years the magnitude of atrocities that he had experienced as a boy, and he said before a German court against his own father.</seg>
<seg id="214">His story shows which great power has a parent about his child and how this child chose a way of salvation.</seg>
<seg id="215">From the sports hall to the military base</seg>
<seg id="216">When my father started to take me up to the military base, I often went to the sports hall. there I had been friends with a boy who made martial arts.</seg>
<seg id="217">They all called him "Kent."</seg>
<seg id="218">I told my father of him and some days later he showed me a black-and-white photo and called me to identify my friend.</seg>
<seg id="219">He said:</seg>
<seg id="220">You are an asshole, you have a friend of ERP.</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">To translate, you need two important skills: passive language skills, in order to understand the starting text and to send active language skills to avoid it in the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active rule of the target language - something that is in case of mother tongue. in general, the belief that translators should be in the target language - not in the output language - native language.</seg>
<seg id="379">This is why a French mother tongue should translate into French from the English language - not from the French to English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo of Flickr users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies employ no staff with English as the native language that could translate translations into English. this may be due to lack of understanding, costs, or the relatively small number of English native speakers that will learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies who have no foreign employees, allow translations to be finished. then, the Japanese staff, whose English knowledge is considered the best, is made to translators - no matter how good or bad his knowledge is really good.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo of Flickr users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machined translations are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">"" "" "" "the worrying and enigmatic phrases that by machine translation will show that this technique can still not replace any human translators. this is especially true for some languages." ""</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strange English formulations in Japan, including the puzzling prints, often used T-Shirts or bags, are used only for stylistic reasons - not to be read or even understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo of Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may be acceptable, or at least harmless. but from large companies or from the Government who have the means to ensure higher standards, you can expect more careful translations.</seg>
<seg id="389">Kyoto will hopefully use a serious source of their translations in the future.</seg>

<seg id="423">The shop is quite simple: a big family with little money gives her minderson's son or her minderaged daughter to another, more abundant family. in exchange, the child gets food, an apprenticeship and a roof over the head.</seg>

<seg id="425">This practice, as Criadazgo, is widespread in Paraguay, due to the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous discomfort of human rights organizations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After completing her studies, Alvarenga worked for a few years for an organization dedicated to the rights of boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She spoke with Criaditas - especially young girls affected by the practice of the Criadazgo - collected testimony, researched and denounced.</seg>
<seg id="428">She tried to name things in the name because the feeling of gratitude is vaccinated, guaranteed in general silence.</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double deception," explains Alvarenga.</seg>

<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">She was Criadita in the household of the former military leader Tomás Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who works as a civil servant at the home office.</seg>
<seg id="439">Marín lived with them in their house in Vaquería, a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital Asuncion.</seg>
<seg id="440">At the end of January 2016, Ferreira proposed as long as with a stick to Marín until they suffered fatal injuries.</seg>

<seg id="442">A few days later the media reported on the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">They stressed that the murdered child was Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organizations like UNICEF or Callescuela made the deep in the paraguayan society rooted practice of the Criadazgo for the death of the girl.</seg>

<seg id="457">Their brothers, all of them had to work and began to sell on the street or market sweets to earn money.</seg>
<seg id="458">But they all went on to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent as Criadita into the capital Asuncion.</seg>
<seg id="460">In their employer, Alvarenga worked in between four and six hours every day.</seg>
<seg id="461">However, she had to divide the time so that you still remained for learning.</seg>
<seg id="462">She rose up every morning at five o'clock and prepared breakfast for their employers.</seg>
<seg id="463">Fridays, for example, it cleaned the fridge, clean the living room, polished furniture and defished the floor.</seg>
<seg id="464">When the school was finished, she went back home and had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="465">The more they had finished with learning, the more leisure it had.</seg>
<seg id="466">But this time was limited, because they had to make dinner for their employer.</seg>
<seg id="467">Alvarenga says she never had to starve, but had not got unlimited eating. "I allowed me to get more books from the landlord as food from the fridge," she reminds her.</seg>
<seg id="468">The library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord, a former military and sympathizers of the Partido Liberal, a Liberal Party, who was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner, who was in power from 1954 to 1989.</seg>
<seg id="469">In some evenings the owner Alvarenga, in addition to him and Editorial from opposition newspapers, such as "Sendero" or "El Pueblo."</seg>
<seg id="470">In doing so, he tried to persuade them to donate the reports of the official media about the dictator's regime.</seg>
<seg id="471">"" "he kept them intelligent, but not with her." "" "the landlord had found someone who listened to politics while he talked about politics." "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="472">"she didn't allow me to visit my family, because she was the opinion that I heard there again" bad habits ". so they thought that Alvarenga belongs to the indigenous communities of the Guaraní people and would speak at home again their native language Guarani.</seg>
<seg id="473">They were afraid that they were the education that she had allowed to lose, she explains.</seg>
<seg id="474">However, it was completely clear that she had paid for everything she had paid off with her hard work.</seg>
<seg id="475">Also in school Alvarenga was also discriminated. "one thing about which almost never spoken is mobbing and the chicans that Criaditas are exposed to school when they go to school.</seg>
<seg id="476">Because the other children have parents, they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents, is a Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="477">I could not invite anyone home to me. I had no friends in school or in the neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="478">In my youth, at the time where friendships were created, I felt very clearly that I did not belong to any group.</seg>

<seg id="544">In early March 2017, Kahoku Shimpo, the progress made for the northeastern Japan, Kahoku Shimpo, made progress in the last six years, was hit by a massive earthquake, a tsunami and an atom accident in Fukushima happened in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, located in the prefecture of Miyagi. Miyagi prefecture has been in Japan's north-East prefecture, which had to live both the earthquake and the resulting tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighboring cultures Fukushima and Iwate were forced, because the tsunami had vanished all coastal cities from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">In addition, the Fukushima prefecture experienced a nuclear accident, already alone 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report by Kahoku Shimpo shows from local perspective which has been achieved for six years after rebuild the lives of local people.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper contains both the statistics of the Japanese rebuilding authority as well as survey results of the concerned itself.</seg>
<seg id="550">The residential construction in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that in December 2015, a total of 77 per cent of the planned spare parts (equivocation, saigai kouei itutaku) were completed in the prefectures Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate.</seg>
<seg id="552">With the three prefectures, Miyagi was reported, 80 percent of the planned spare parts were finished.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, whereas Fukushima opened its final light with 70 percent.</seg>
<seg id="554">Nevertheless, one tries to strive for six years after the disaster, evacuated by sheltered shelters (bordership, casetsu itutaku), in final spare parts.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the trary catastrophe, almost 80 000 people were forced to live in sheltered accommodations.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016, there were still 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate in such comfort.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 percent of the 2011 event evacuated from Fukushima still live in notifications, whereas Miyagi was successful on this occasion, more than 75 percent of the evacuated ones, who had budgeted after disaster in shelters, were resettled in final houses.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate the number here is 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three affected prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">Like the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper, 1074 of 1100 schools, who were affected by misfortune, opened its doors until December 2016, which makes up almost 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, the industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is much more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While almost 100 percent of fishing harbours in Iwate and Miyagi have now been in operation, at Fukushima only 30 per cent of the fishing harbors have resumed their operation.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and nuclear accident, have severely affected in the three prefectures of agricultural land.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi could re-produce 93 percent of its agricultural areas, with only 66 percent of the agricultural land in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed farmland in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">"" "it is unlikely that this is only a result of the nuclear accident, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed land of Fukushima are in the" "" "nuclear dispute zone" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures, tourism has recovered largely back, but again Fukushima remains undefeated.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwate are back at 90 percent on the same level as before the misfortune. Fukushima, however, can exhibit here only 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that since the disaster almost half of the coastal inhabitants, it is more difficult to earn their livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is native people prepared for the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">To determine a total picture, the newspaper introduced numerous surveys under the local population and the evacuated by. she questioned them about the state of reconstruction and also how their empathy has changed over the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In its introduction of the article, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">Kahoku Shimpo led a survey to bring more about the tsunami consciousness among the local population in experience.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey carried out that 83.1 percent of the local habitants, measures taken to be prepared to be prepared for the future earthquake and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of respondents think that there was still not enough to do disasters in disasters.</seg>
<seg id="575">How it stands for those who have to evacuate from the Fukushima prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="576">In its issue of the anniversary of the earthquake, Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has also directed its attention to the situation of evacuated Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima did not only have to experience the massive earthquake and devastating tsunami, no, the Fukushima prefecture has also been witness of the worst, disaster caused, nuclear accident damaged in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="578">Of 160 000 evacuated from Fukushima, nearly 63 000 people were moved in areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016, some more than 23 000 people, back to Fukushima, had been resettled in permanent spare parts.</seg>
<seg id="580">After the 2017 stand there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima outside their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the disaster areas, most of the evacuation areas, which are still more than 50 years old, are known to cause the reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima with massive construction projects. this is a project that will be part of the Olympic Games, which will be held in Tokyo in 2020.</seg>

<seg id="625">The most forgotten villages in Cuba</seg>
<seg id="626">With the introduction of the law of Álvaro Reynoso, almost hundreds of sugar tubes made the doors in Cuba (photo: Julio Batista).</seg>
<seg id="627">The Poporio Arleé Mañalich, located in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is commonly known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - regardless of its fact that there are no significant sugar harvesting on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years ago when the activities were paralysed in the sugar cane factories.</seg>
<seg id="629">After the harvest the sugar cane industry stood still in the region, and the factory lost gradually and after its plants until only the framework of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to invent themselves anew.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changed the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Other resigned and commute daily to the factories, which still grind.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a Soldier's Day, rising every day at 4: 00 a.m., the crisis in the sugar cane processing is not able to sleep its sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that in the east of the sugar cane factories, after a long inactive time, they are in operation since they were preserved.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene remembers to have heard exactly that in Mañalich the sugarcane factory would be preserved, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar cane industry withstood the plagues, the case of socialism, the low market prices, inefficiency, bad management decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016 the production was 1.6 million tonnes of sugar, less than the amount produced in 1910.</seg>
<seg id="639">The news would have been a motive for some decades ago, but the bad yields already have no more news.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why is the Cuban sugar cane switched off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old train station of the church saw better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The crushing of the sugar cane industry was an economical need: the 155 sugar cane factories were technically deprecated, and hardly competitive for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to focus the production on the most efficient factories, the annual production target was 4 million tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories left, which can produce sugar for at most 4 Centavos (0.03 euros).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution to unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motifs, which led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the global market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless the sugar prices rose again about a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 until 2025 the price of unrefined sugar may be between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the 2016 report "Agricultural Perspectives" by the OECD and FAO, Agriculture and Food Organization of the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="650">If current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), raw sugar exports would generate roughly 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>
<seg id="652">"" "" "" "today's day will come to history in history," "" "these were the first words of Cuban President Fidel Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lavandero." ""</seg>
<seg id="653">From then on the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began.</seg>
<seg id="654">The following years, a total of 98 sugarcane factories, more than 65 million people received their full salaries for further education.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane factory Gregorio Arlée Mañalich on May 14, 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto Pérez worked in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">"" "when Nene is known as a soldier, about the closure of the factory speaks, the word he is repeating most," "" "Scam" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all respondents are the same opinion: not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order to get the place, they formed a full-time working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the first year, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">It was officially included documents that would only be drawn regarding the parts that would be removed, the address sat and the date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Ulises Rosales del Toro, only the minister could approve every withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="663">By then on, the responsibility was surpassed and the letters were becoming more and more common.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for the discontinued factory for two years, and he was one who received the letters. "the country had no money for the sugar factory that was still running in operation.</seg>
<seg id="665">Eddy Reyes, 64 years, waits for retirement in another facility, the Boris Luis Santa Coloma.</seg>
<seg id="666">He was against his will at the nursing office of the factory, whose construction he helped.</seg>
<seg id="667">With each part he removed, he dismantled one of his 31 years of work.</seg>
<seg id="668">The most developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important job producers was extinguished.</seg>
<seg id="669">In many cases, there were no alternatives for the jobs and services mentioned in the congregations where they found themselves.</seg>
<seg id="670">We will never know if during the mammoth speech of 21 October 2002, the then president in the eyes of the present persons saw when he guaranteed to have been running for the areas, whose factories had not run into operation for five years.</seg>
<seg id="671">The price of the population for the closure of the sugar cane</seg>
<seg id="672">Since 2004, sugar cane has only been extracted high by mixing.</seg>

<seg id="674">After two years the congregation of Gregorio Arleé Mañalich learned that many things are changing, but not always for the better when a factory is closed.</seg>
<seg id="675">When the sugar factory closed, or better said than they began to depriate them, they also listened to the road, disadvantaged other establishments.</seg>
<seg id="676">Without work in the region, and with advanced age, Nene and Eddy had to look for other factories.</seg>
<seg id="677">They were shared to spare parts.</seg>
<seg id="678">Without future, many young people left the region as well.</seg>
<seg id="679">In the area a food factory was created, whose production does not even work for the supply of the community.</seg>
<seg id="680">The ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still imposing.</seg>
<seg id="681">At the end of 2016, Nene joined the factory Boris Luis Santa Coloma back, the ruins of the place where he began to work.</seg>

<seg id="683">Mr Nene, a man of black skin colour, small, with a few teeth and clear voice, is not a gruelling person, yet he gives the lies that told him not.</seg>
<seg id="684">They tortured him for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="685">Nene is about 65 years in pension, not because it is lacking in power but because he is bitter.</seg>

<seg id="692">Youngsters of the First Nations communities across Canada deal with topics that are important to them. they do with Hip-Hop, thanks to a number of hiking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan tour since 2014, workshop manager mobile cinema leads directly to schools and youth centers to teach youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were guided by the pedagogue David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked in North-Quebec with ten Cree communities and then together with the Cree Hip Hop Group The Northstars.</seg>
<seg id="695">"" "the workshop thus increases the young participants in discussions such as" "" "cultural identity, language, meditation, love, self acceptable" "" "or whatever the purpose." ""</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the youngsters are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Winnebago in the U.S. state of Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">"" "this video of the school" "" "Na Aksa Gyilak'yoo" "" "in the area of the tribe of the Kitbukalum First Nation in British Columbia tells the story of Highway 16, also" "" "Highway of tears," "", "a street stage in Westkanada, where nearly two dozen most often indigenous young women disappeared or murdered." ""</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were largely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motive of a video game to mediate, such as important the receipt of traditional customs and customs of war, despite the influences of globalisation.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, though the youngsters do not always prevail in the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation has recorded, the refrain will be sung at Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved with help from Gary Jolly from the Northstars Hip Hop Group who gave them a verse in the dialect of Eastern James Bay Cree.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the facebookpage of N'we Jinan the verse is available in reverse, as well as a translation into English, which is translated into German:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like nobody ever interested in myself</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to continue my days on Earth</seg>
<seg id="707">That is the day you'll take our cry.</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we have lost our way to life in life</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will rise a day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how she lives a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">So they can grow and lead our youth as well.</seg>
<seg id="712">This way, they can do what is meant by the Creator.</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan you can see most plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">To show potential customers what exactly on the menu stands, will be exhibited close to the entrance of shokuhin sanpuru (voicing, "Plastics Models from the courts"), which is served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">The customers see this plastic dishes, and then decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry devoted to the production of this plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the dead district of Kappabashi there are a lot of these small companies that just produce plastic dishes, produced by the German filmmaker Wim Wenders in his film Tokyo-Ga over 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese, these plastic bags are so usually that they are not even more striking. however, a new trend is transformed into current cell phone accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">In Naver Matome, the blogger itinii publishes a number of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in the special sale: new plastic-made plastic ribbons well as they can be shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial foods have turned to kitschigen Flatts, as in this case, fridge magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few Shokugo refrigerators for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom of eating positions is increasingly elaborate.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case, an imperial-don (a popular rice dish with seafood) was transformed into a mobile stand.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we have found a good use as a mobile stand.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also manufactured this part for the Tokyo exhibition at the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an Apple containing your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the mobile phone, this is already a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And this is just the beginning of a growing flight into the comic.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile phone support and mobile designers allow you to make your own artwork. in this case, ikura and salmon cheated are used, a popular topping which is served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">Some users had their doubts on Twitter:</seg>
<seg id="737">"" "there's someone who would say:" "" "Wow, cool, now I can decorate my mobile with laughing?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I'll be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic dishes can also take less appetizing form to surprise for example colleagues or family members.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile phone stand has the form of meltmelting ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition there are also rice balls (onigiri), earrings and handybands from dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">Other skurrile plastic dishes can look at: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow on Twitter the hashtag # 1.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you like to learn more about the origin of this trends, then this video gives you an insight into the Kappabashi area, which is dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry. like for example with the shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>
<seg id="744">The following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually made.</seg>

<seg id="774">"" "" "" "we must not only show the faces of the one who are afraid. we must show the international community to conflicts, fragility and state leadership." ""</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a reader of Animal Político, wrote this post from Taxco, in the State of Guerrero, in Central Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Your contribution is reminiscent of us, that you should never consider force to be normal, no matter what form it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I now know illness and sensational journalism now for a few years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">I pass every day to newspaper kiosks and see the cover pages with pictures which actually only come from a textbook for criminology or files from specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel like I am the only one who is stunned or sad. it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I can't be indifferent, or consider it as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She continues writing:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it's not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks he wants to become Narco (German: drug dealers) if it is big. and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the "heroism" of crimes when they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me, it's like those who have lost someone who have lost someone, and those who are afraid that something happens to them as well.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness if stories are going to mere numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"" "the insomnia of men is incredible to me when death of six people and the disappearances are justified by 43 students in a neighboring place that they" "" "disappeared" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="789">"" "" "" "I think they are trying to agree that they are spared from such tragedies if they are not stirring and silent." ""</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the article "Four months extortion in the main city districts:" in it she describes how armed criminals were astonished for month money from their business, until they were not only destroyed by the business, but also their family had torn apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you lost and remember how some people can completely change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>

<seg id="798">I asked myself in these awful days if weeping would dissolve my deep-root feelings, but the reply is no, because I forgot to live like you weep. I must learn to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">"" "the journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega published the paper" "" "The Forgotten Children of Ciudad Juárez: a Generation of Violence" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction he raises questions, such as: who cares for the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age, whose parents take care of them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is a fatherless and he tells him to teach himself how to make a egg cook, potatoes, tortillas warm and "chichi" for the babies who live with him. this is his name for the preparation of the vial with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">It tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for each year.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - unutterable for a boy who consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood was over two years before, when he was only a few blocks from his home, the bloody body of his father was shot by armed men from a passing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez looked like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006, when violence was organised by the organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010, Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of people according to information of civil security and government of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone the Public Prosecution filed 3103 Morde. this corresponds to average 8.5 Morden per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few hundreds of thousands of stories that organized the organised crime in Mexico and penetrate the country's soul.</seg>
<seg id="814">Few stories are still living in view of the new headlines. but this project reminds us of those we must not forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" founded the data journalism project Narcodata in 2015, its aim is to present the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug trafficking, which has tortured the country in the last four decades, in understanding a clearely way.</seg>

<seg id="825">In 2010, a tanker crossed the place Sange in the east of the DR Congo, tipped around and exploded. 230 people died.</seg>
<seg id="826">After civil war, Africa's second largest country had been neglected and devastated. the streets in the region became a dangerous pageant full of impact holes that were difficult to ride.</seg>

<seg id="833">It features rows of wired body which are lined up on the ground while people are watching them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story does not end its end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years the same picture has been wiped several times on social media, blogs and other platforms, but may not be attributed to the tragedies in particular events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What and what did not happen in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, Boko Haram attacked the remotely Nigerian villages of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eye witnesses reported drastically about atrocities before they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burnt down, bodies lay in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">"" "but the figures could not be confirmed," "" "no one remained behind to count corpses," "" "said one people to Human Rights Watch." ""</seg>
<seg id="842">Many were crushed, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">The following periods can only be depicted on the basis of satellite photos.</seg>
<seg id="844">The occasion of the attack was also unsolved, but the military base in Baghdad was a permanent conflict between the military Nigerias and the attempt to win Boko Haram, a country (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here, the picture from the DR Congo appeared again, as proof of the fact and the potential extent of the attack was presented:</seg>
<seg id="846">That is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days to Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this abusive use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of misdepreciation and Africa check has documented orders to Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases the image was presented as a cover for measures.</seg>
<seg id="852">Another step further will provide personal comments such as this example wrongly the picture from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to deliver arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The picture from Sange also occurred in conjunction with the fatal persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a flash, published by the United Nations, those who managed to flee, rape and some dead, some through burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported from violence against the Rohingya, posts appeared as the following that brought these descriptions with photos from the DR Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture was taken by an Saudi-Arab news page, which claimed 2012 that the President Myanmars Than said, monks and politicians would have participated in the assassination of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, she had used the picture of the DR Congo to address this information.</seg>

<seg id="935">The circulation of huge images was already debated (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">One argument is that the withholding of images of a refusal to recognize the tragedy. sometimes these images are even demanded by the victims themselves.</seg>

<seg id="1136">Can there be a possibility, here and now, despite a language barrier to contact someone?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the initiative Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS) is a possible answer to stories in their original language.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices told you recently about another initiative by Steven Bird, the inaudible blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">However, the focus of TLS is not on the written word, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to obtain and dignify the language variety of major cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin, Australia, or in Oakland, in the United States, where TLS has already carried out events since 2015, the risk that small and not quite so small languages were not given to the newborn children.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the project makers:</seg>
<seg id="1142">Mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided if we have to establish the cities - secure spaces, in which inhabitants must not forget who they are to be added.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "while listening often is often associated with" "" "to understand these events instead" "" "to listen to feeling, to make." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, histytellers show their story in their own language before and translate, or explain them in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Although the participants are not a professional tellers, their devotion and presentation carry on it.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They call to laugh and emotion when the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows, for example, a traditional story from Burkina Faso, which is told in the language Dafing. during this round, the storytellers of Rassidatou won the opportunity to explain the most typical of her country.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event, John Nyamusara tells the beak of the bunny and the Pavian in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>

<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were all with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">So far the events of Treasure Language Storytelling have taken place in three cities, and the organizers hope to expand this. all those who are inspired by the project can get in touch with TLS in order to organize their own skills.</seg>

<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>

<seg id="1187">The book that was published last year and licensed here, contains a number of approaches to deal with free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it is called:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book wants to revise how movements for free knowledge are being built and what are true costs, with whom these are connected.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researcher and authors who have participated in the movements for free knowledge, have side on page to look over the fog that surrounds our newsfeeds and create something sense of our various experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartabil, the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteers who has been detained in Syria since March 15, 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was painted from the directory of the Adra prison, in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then we have no information about his current state or residence.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice that would push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom.</seg>
<seg id="1196">To see how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture, many of us begin to reflect on their own destinies, actions and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we choose?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up extreme beliefs in this process?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The developer of Open Source and digital activist has been in custody for Syrian government agencies since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military facility to an unknown place.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, the writer and lawyer, Noura Ghazi, reported that the "Military Police Bassel was based on a" strictly secret "recorded command of the military court of his cell in Adra."</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that she was contacted by persons on 12 November 2015, engaged himself as insider of the Assad government and put them into knowledge by an alleged death sentence against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">His whereabouts and condition remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel plays a crucial role in spreading access to the Internet and to the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and currently passes the director of New Palmyra, a project that formed Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Maybe none of Basel's cultural prototypes were prospective as the work that he started to redesign with a group of archeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to redesign the ancient ruins of Palmyra.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the waycross of numerous civilians and here merging Greek-Roman architecture with hiesigen traditions and personal influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">Bassel was not able to know that ten years after he began working with this work, the IS would put all this architecture, which embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This strip to the digital Archaeology and the preservation has created a time cartridge that will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future of invaluable value.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Tragically, Bassel could not conclude this project yet.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in jail:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I have spent my whole life, dreaming of freedom and who taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel gave me English, even when he was already detained.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I learned to read, write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He always shared his knowledge with anyone who asked him. he has taught others to read, write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel has opened the gate to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He taught me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also taught other inmates, as they use computer, at least theoretically without having actually held a hand in her hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Warten auf), a proxy, which she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 when he was detained.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked together for one year along the book.</seg>
<seg id="1223">They smuggled the lyrics to him, when she visited him and he translated them from the Arab to English.</seg>

<seg id="1230">That I lose the reflection in the moment in which we embrace,</seg>
<seg id="1231">That each of the dangers are no matter,</seg>
<seg id="1232">Each of the fences, fetters and guards</seg>

<seg id="1240">And to smile and smile on your absence.</seg>
<seg id="1241">I bear witness myself that I will return soon...</seg>

<seg id="1249">Those who were arrested or executed under violence by the regime, were tortured or executed by the regime.</seg>
<seg id="1250">Until 2016, according to the international human rights organisation Amnesty International had died at least 17.723 Syrians in prison since 2011.</seg>
<seg id="1251">The stories of many other people remain unknown.</seg>

<seg id="1255">"" "" "" "Mozambique responded with anger over a corruption incident where a government member returned to the workplace after half of his sentence at the state of the state, where corruption was committed." ""</seg>
<seg id="1256">This is what Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and in 2010 together with four other defendants, was sentenced to 22 years in prison, with four other defendants.</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money was from public funds from Mozambique airports, whose Council was headed by Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 for a good lead and immediately called for his return to the company, which occurred on April 19, then.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a statement by the Attorney General of the Republic, who decided to apply the request, there would be no obstacle to Cambaza, as the company had no discipline in his detention.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many residents are not doing the action good.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integridade Pública, short CIP), a local institution which advocates for public transparency, sentenced in an interview with the Deutsche Welle, the decision of the company to restore the director again:</seg>
<seg id="1262">"" "" "" "poses a setback in the fight against corruption and clarifies the lack of transparency and is even a regression regarding the efforts of our legal system, such as the CIP." ""</seg>
<seg id="1263">"" "" "" "what we have to know is that the company should have introduced a" "" "disciplinary method against the reversing" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1264">However, the company apparently failed and prompted any reasonable legal steps for applying the respective functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">"" "Egídio Vaz, a significant voice in the Muslim social media, rejects this behavior also and consider the case as" "" "refusal" "" ":" ""</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza would be a competent guy, he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of them had lunch.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could have paid lectures and motivating words, he could advise and polishing his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But as he is incompetent, he has approved to be reintegrated into the company, which he helped to add damage.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore, it is obvious: Cambaza would like to be paid for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Contradictory!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitter Viage, Young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil says of no moral question:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza is rewarded by the state, because he objected him, I can't believe that someone has made someone so massive already.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza lacks morality to return and serve the state, * he already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead he only served by the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state, as trade, it is an inexhaustible money source and the state itself has become tired of this man who was finally charged and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this man was so rewarded.</seg>

<seg id="1289">According to data from Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took their postcards from the net because they contained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although the origin of the word is still being debated, it is usually used to refer to humans East Indian origin or generally used as an adjective. "</seg>
<seg id="1291">"" "Facebook censored the word" "" "Kalar" "" "or the" "" "Kalar" "" ") as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of foreign language in Burma in the social network." ""</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the rise of radical nationalistic movements has given the word an extremely difficult connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that mostly used by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims who represent a minority of population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in the efforts to combat hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of voluminous content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">Indeed, 'Kalar' may normally be associated with racism, but the word on itself doesn't automatically call Hasspronunciation.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that also posts in which they have discussed the use of the word, or in doubt about his use have been expressed, censored.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Beyond that there are several burial words with different meanings, which have the same character sequence as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, the chair is written to Burmese too 'Kalar htaing' which contains the same letters as also other words such as' Kalar pae '(Spage bse),' Kalar Oat '(chamel) or' kalarkaar '(curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The facebooggering Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar':</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of my friends was deleted today, because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he asked his friends in a spiritual way, whether they would like to alleviate his back pain by making a word game.</seg>
<seg id="1302">"" "the set ku la -" "" "cure" "" "(ku) + the question word (la) on Burmese - similar to the racist expression, but the context is completely different." ""</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Hats is the opinion that they may decrease Hasspronunciation of radical nationalists, though it also stressed that Facebook analyses down all the posts that spread in the suspicion of racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook deletes the word "Kalar" manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It is filtering the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The automation will not understand what you write to facbeook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should be done instead, to analyse the mail carefully and check it by checking the words of the words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example, "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pae" (Spage bsen).</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good thing is that these dirty nationalists who spread the hasspronunciation are a pretty good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise its nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action may send a strong signal to all the hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not persist long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China like Sina Weibo and WeChat have shown that the censorship is often a cat and mouse game, where users can simply use social networks to express a new word or an alternative writing of the censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook started to delete his posts when he just wanted to inform his friends that the word 'Kalar' is banished from social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I was aware of this new directive on Facebook, I made a post to share my Facebook friends that the word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">"" "ironically, my post of Facebook was removed and I prohibited the liken, post and share of content for 24 hours because the post" "" "the Facebook Community" "" "was not unanswered." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has a lot of postcards from people who have no negative intentions or they simply try to show their opinions about the nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed, who has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post, the author shared his opinion about why extreme Nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have said before the start of the initiative more, for example, the Burmese Internet Community asked for advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook might have a benevolent intention to reduce racism in Burma by their platform, but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Such words can only add more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">In addition, it appears as if they have started without local context or technical support and have been forbidden as "chair" or "inheritance curry."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they have made mistakes, they did not tempt the falsified posts.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits, which gave them a great turnover, that would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebooks automatic censorship has provided for much ridicule among the users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Rather than take it seriously, users now make fun and write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the net.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots from Facebook posts that have no hasspronunciation, but nevertheless removed:</seg>
<seg id="1330">With permission used.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The Burmese text is "I want to sit on a chair and watch peas curry and watch a Indian film.</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "just to try out whether Facebook is the mail that contains the word Kalar." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">Screenshot, with permission used.</seg>
<seg id="1334">"" "the Post says," "" "If you are a doctor, do you cure people?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1335">Screenshot, with permission used.</seg>
<seg id="1336">In the past five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists who have used social networks to extend their voices and their influence.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, Hasspronunciation in social networks will also heat the violence in the congregations in Myanmar, especially in the area Rakhine, where disputes between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands to flee.</seg>
<seg id="1338">For his failure, Facebook has been criticised for his burners, criticises his burial pages under control.</seg>
<seg id="1339">But rather than simply use the word 'Kalar', it would have been better, rather than in context than on code concentrating initiatives and learned from them.</seg>

<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform placed all Turkish Wikipedia sites on its dedicated peer-to-peer network (i.e. calculator software connections), which does not make up a complete censorship in the system of domain names.</seg>

<seg id="1415">Photo by Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was with the photos that he looked around around, never satisfied. they were blurred with badly positioned motifs and well-washed colors.</seg>
<seg id="1418">That motivated him to wear a camera, and try to handle the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">Back then he was a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar strives to bring Nepalese to the international stage.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his native town directly next to Chitwan National Park, offering him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that move the attention to Nepalese wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook as this first-class situation in his work helps:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested from home when I had called Navaraj (the manager of Chitwan Gaida Lodge). he had received a call from my father, that a leopard was on the banks of the Rapti river.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river damm is only a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river where the leopard was, and I immediately began to crackle pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar strives to achieve a collaboration with the authorities to gain global recognition for Nepals nature and would like to deepen understanding that wild animals are not so furious, as they look like.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know it because he was standing up to face to face from face to face:</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger does not disturb the sheep's opinion!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleeping time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">Even I was there because of the darkness on the way home, when suddenly the king of the book appeared. he immediately shows us and he stares at the Sal trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar placed the logo "I click for Conservation" (lit.: I click for environmental protection) on his photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">His passion for the promotion of Nepals nature and wild animals is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days and mostly lived in a tent to take pictures of Otter. up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist information.</seg>

<seg id="1469">This post was written by Kayonaaz Kalyanwala and was originally published on video Volunteers, an award-winning international community organization from India.</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version was once again published as part of an content-sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India there are women with the greatest care to speak the names of their husbands or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead, use a gonomers or say "father's father."</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, women give women to respect the husband's social pressure, as well as the fear of the consequences they should disregard the norm in life.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year Malati Mahatoto was convicted of the Indian State of Oosta and thrown by a family and the village community after having called a married relatives with names.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of her wives likewise does not give them name, is also common among men. however, they have far less subsidence to fear, if at all, they should not follow this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health professionals and housewives, were thus quickly leading to the city's leading placard theme.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place just for them alone, where they can discuss and discuss the delicacies of Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of 56 clubs, which exists in 13 indian states, he is part of the campaign # KhelBadal which is operated by the community video Volunteers and is set up for the degradation of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Paist has been working for seven years with the help of her videocamera, such as children's marriage to the exile of HIV- and AIDS-infected, and heads these clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">It reports about how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time they have made ambassesses of the change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video that Rohini showed in their discussion round, did women who call their husbands on behalf.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She chose this subject, because she wanted to open the talk about the Patriarchate with a problem with which women can identify easily.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The names of their husbands do not speak loudly, is a custom to keep them guilty and never questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini means:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition witnessed that a wife respected her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not agree, is regarded as a crafist, as a woman without moral.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning Rohini, who had never called her husband so far, wanted to try out at home, as it runs.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round of her husband and mother in law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother in law and my husband still weigh out long after the video was at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said, I should call him from now on his name.</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this self-confidence in the luggage Rohini started her first discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1494">"" "many women had never heard the word" "" "Patriarchate" "" "before. some believed that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women would be protected." ""</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem at Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection, women tried to put discussion with an exercise.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked every participant to tell her husband's name - happy, upset, sad, loving and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">"" "then asked them all," "" "If we can't tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us how they want us to respect us?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equivalent? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day to whom they brought the name of their husbands on her lips," says Rohini Paist from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra on the Breast of a century tradition, in whom women have never married the name of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy, that during the whole practice, a woman decided to leave his own frustration against him and his family by taking him away.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Even in the adrenalin rush to have broken with an old custom, the women decided that they would actually try to call their husbands on behalf.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they held their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the coming days Rohini received a variety of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas they put into the head: his wife couldn't stop saying his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it for dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-mother she stared, she was afraid, and said that it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">Another woman said, "Rohini said, I should do it."</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of participants was less understanding and the situation arted in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports how women tried to stop other practices, such as wearing a chin-red point on the forehead, which indicates the spouses:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why must only women show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband, that I would bear the chin-off point if he did.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He only laughed and I listened to wear it.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women didn't stop completely because they think they are now in a better position to choose, not to carry him on some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the discussion cullub is a secure place where they can exchange their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"we are doing an excursion at every discussion group.</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "I don't want the women to make sure what could hear," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">During the last months she celebrated her own birthdays with cake; she danced and sang about things about which they had never thought about.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have said about some things, for example, how our identities are knotted to our husbands, never to be honest.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to say certain things to say, no matter how small they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected with clothes.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only taken saris for their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most of them it is okay, but some wanted a Salman-Kurta, a wide shirt over a pants, wear; they have not cloaked.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After much strife and discussion about the advantages of their own clothing, morals connected with the Saris and much more, Rohggelte Rohini their own pair of courses (Obershirts) in a discussion round so that women were able to carry them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next, they decided to plan a trip to Goa where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure that they will create it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">"" "" "" "the question is whether in the five months since their first discussion cullub has changed somewhat, Rohini confirms that things come slowly into the roles:" ""</seg>
<seg id="1532">"" "" "" "we have only made small steps so far." ""</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tasted it a few times, but then they listened to saying their husband's name.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including me, do it, but only if they are alone and no other family members are involved.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the names of their husbands; only one or two women now wear Zinnoberred at their foreheads.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in a discussion lub know that changes that they want to achieve in their lives - like feeling of freedom of movement or their own clothes-choice - at the end of a hard to navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self-confidence, they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each one of us is a sacrifice of patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am it too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives us confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that there is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction if any woman dies home in the club and other people talk about what we talk about and what we do.</seg>

<seg id="1627">This story was originally published on July 8, 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press.</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The fall of Chinese dissidents Liu Xiaobo has drawn attention to the international community, after his lawyer was announced at the end of June that he had been hospitalized for liver cancers in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009, Liu was sentenced to eleven years "imprisonment for" Subversion "(state of state) after having engaged in the draft of the Charter, a manifesto which calls for democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"" "the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China has referred to as" "" "an internal matter" "" "and narrated a speaker, he considered it" "" "not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1633">Yet China continues to get calls from the international community to allow Nobel laureate and his wife, poet Liu Xia, to allow him to offer a treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries criticised the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing, others are completely exhausted.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has summarized some reactions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United Nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, the High Commissioner of the United Nations for Human Rights, met at the end of June Chinese officials to discuss the case of Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1638">However, a speaker refused to comment whether the United Nations should exert pressure to make Liu abroad a treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's Minister of Ministers in Erna Solberg and Minister of Foreign Affairs Børge Brende have refused to answer questions about Lius's liberation.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway fell into the stores after the Nobel Peace Prize awarded to Liu in 2010, although the Norwegian Government agreed to do nothing with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations were only continued until December last year. in June, Norway signed an agreement to return the salmon to China, since its exports were mostly blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After the news spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel committee brought his hope for a unconditional release and invited Liu to withdraw his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Because of his imprisonment, he was not able to pay his price.</seg>
<seg id="1645">Liu was represented by an empty chair during the ceremony.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">On 6 July, the European Parliament passed a resolution on which China was prompted to free Liu and his wife immediately from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support, where he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The top diplomat of the EU, Federica Mogherini, also called for the release of Lius, as she announced in a statement on 30 June:</seg>
<seg id="1649">We expect China to raise all restrictions from Mr. Lius wife, as well as family members.</seg>
<seg id="1650">They should meet and receive all visits, who wish them to be able to communicate and be able to communicate freely with the outside world.</seg>

<seg id="1653">A female speaker in the US Embassy in China, Mary Beth Polley, announced the news agency AFP on June 27 that the Embassy decided to free the Chinese authorities, not only Liu free but also his wife Liu Xia put from her house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "the invitation from the US Embassy moved a furious response from China to the utterance of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, that" "" "no country has the right to interfere and irresponsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley told that China should offer the following:</seg>
<seg id="1656">Protection and freedom, such as travel speech and access to the medical care of his choice, which they claim according to Chinese constitution and legal system and international obligations.</seg>
<seg id="1657">"" "the U.S. Senators" "" "Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkley and Ted Cruz also introduced a decision in the Congress to push the Chinese government on it to release Liu and his wife unconditionally." ""</seg>

<seg id="1661">The Chinese President Xi Jinping appeared on July 7 and 8 at the G20 summit in Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1662">Previously reported diplomatic sources in Beijing the news agency Reuters, China had great concerns whether the vortex could be shadowed by Liu's visit to Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1663">Canada</seg>
<seg id="1664">On 28 June, the Canadian Ambassador, John McCallum, called for China to provide an appropriate medical care, and to give him the opportunity to provide himself with his family.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Lius lawyer told AFP earlier that Lius Ms. Liu Xia could visit him every day but the police always admitted the room in the hospital, and that Liu is not allowed to talk with someone outside, including his attorneys, to speak and contact.</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum continues to tell:</seg>
<seg id="1667">Canada calls on China to maintain its international human rights obligations, including freedom of expression, maintaining the rights of the rights reserved for the exercise of these rights.</seg>
<seg id="1668">France</seg>
<seg id="1669">France's foreign affairs urged China to release Liu out of humanitarian reasons on 29 June:</seg>
<seg id="1670">All necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xiaobo receives all treatments which he, regardless where, needs. furthermore his wife and his family have to contact him.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Although the news channel France Info told that the French government would welcome Liu in the country, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there will be no further information out if France will eventually take him.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Taiwan</seg>
<seg id="1673">"" "" "" "the Council of the landlandings in Taiwan called on 27 June on Tuesday to release Liu and deploy a greater tolerance towards those who want peaceful funds to challenge political reforms and democratic development." ""</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Taiwanese legislator Yu Mei-nu from the ruling Democratic Fortress Party called on to allow the ill-intellectual Liu to treat yourself in Taiwan.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Dalai Lama</seg>
<seg id="1676">The spiritual leader in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, showed himself in a statement on 28 June by Liu very worried and gave to that many have asked him to pray for Lius well-being.</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">"" "" "" "it is my faith, that the initiatives that he took and was strictly punished to a harmonious, more stable and wealthy China, which in turn would have contributed to a peaceful world." ""</seg>
<seg id="1679">I personally felt very moved and encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, the Charter 08 signed, which stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China.</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or a country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid, as Singapore is recognized as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice, K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the Bar Association in New York, the Minister found that many people criticised the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because they were compared to Singapore with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">It supports Singapore to be considered as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">That's it, with most people a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"" "the blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice," "" "turning the logic" "" "to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore." ""</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and efforts to create this valuable land, we can say that we have no country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of a flight before the responsibilities, a breach of breach.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, whose country is it?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons made by Shanmugam were not very nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', given that he was inevitably undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">On the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities like Chicago, San Francisco or New York, alike cities which are run permanently from a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">As soon as you reach the core point of the subject, the good old bodies of the authoritarian leaders, which pretend Democrats, leave the distorted logic, as it fits better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the last week of Shanmugam the answers were given to its American guests regarding our press, our Jewish philosophy, our political system really non-answers.</seg>
<seg id="1703">He put appropriate questions with non-responses a rational way.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls for Shanmugam to understand his opinion since she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Personally I find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country but a city, so to which country is our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I don't understand anything.</seg>
<seg id="1708">"" "" "" "I would be very grateful if our dear K Shanmugam would accept the effort to elucidate this point, so far as he was paid to be part of the Government of Singapore." ""</seg>
<seg id="1709">By announcing on his comment on the blog, he suggests that it should begin to read the entire writing of the conference, so that in the context of the testimonies of Shanmugam could better understand, according to Singapore, a city, and no country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the address.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"" "when he said that Singapore was rather a" "" "city" "" "than a country," "" "he explained why elections in Singapore would be so ungodly important, even if we are looking forward to free and fair elections." ""</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of those cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "when he said," "" "be no country," "" "he obviously didn't mean it in this sense!" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment of Shanmugam, who as leader of a growing generation, makes such a polemic statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">"" "" "" "I am above what the justice minister of Singapore has said very much..." ""</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old garde what awaits me - I agree with them or not, but that's a different thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, member of the new generation of the political leader of Singapore, I have doubts and I am not sure if he really believes it is really associated and aware of what he defends.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review computes the vulnerabilities of Shanmugams Arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">Did Mr. Shanmugam "benevolent a mistake," or was it a Freudscher Load?</seg>

<seg id="1721">If not, in which country are the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore back?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is equally land and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">Because he plays an important role within the government office, the testimonies of Mr. Shanmugam are of significant importance.</seg>

<seg id="1898">On the way to the migrants which cross Europe or Latin America, certain places will be known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tapachula, he is located at the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel close to the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is managed by a 59- year-old Mexican, a small woman with a coral pink BrillenChassis and golden earrings in teddy bears.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She's called Concepción González Ramírez and was raised in Tapachula and still know them many under the name Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a target for Africans and Haitians that are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about 2,50 dollars the night sleep in simple rooms, with bare, abracking walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrots in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no signpost to the hotel - however, hundreds of African and Haitian migrants are coming here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes Mrs Ramírez tells, people arrive in full minibuses and from the upper part of the coast to call it: "Mama Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mum from Africa? "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At the moment, it is rather quiet but in this year Ramírez has already welcomed 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have also slept outside on cardboard boxes.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She wants to refuse anyone.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and bring them to the hospital when they are sick, she buys them medication that they can't pay, they masked them with a balm that used the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, has arrived at a short time ago.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama Africa was a reasonable nickname for Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>

<seg id="1924">You have lived in Brazil, however, it is for some Africans that are on the way to the United States to make normal one first stop in South America and then move towards north.</seg>
<seg id="1925">"" "the family had heard of other tours of Mama Africa." "" "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track," "" "explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti." ""</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells us that the Haitians and Africans are often travelling together and that Africans are already speaking to WhatsApp from Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Like many of his companion, Michelet has lived in Brazil before and worked as building worker for construction sites of the Olympic Games and FIFA World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy is weaker, he started its journey into the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest in Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the Busticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will contact Mrs. Ramírez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"" "" "" "Mama Africa is our mother and we never let them go again," "" "he answered smiling." "" "we will always stay in touch." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1932">Mrs. Ramírez tells you to send her guests often text messages when they continue to grate them or to report their journey over the course of their journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">It explains that their Christian faith is the drive of their labour.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests taught her to prepare chicken like in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Mrs. Ramírez is perhaps very well known, but she is not the only sparks hope for the migrants who go through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jesús Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">This winter, Valenzuela and his family migrated to migrants in their small house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and has found that the Bustickets are sold too expensive to numerous African immigrants.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He has begun to help them a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for one dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment 25 people are there, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on the ground, but at least they have electricity, washing machine and cooking.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests are through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"" "" "" "I have lived in the United States," "" "he tells." "" "I have experienced what they are experiencing." ""</seg>

<seg id="1946">After he lived for three years, he was referred to a raid on his work office out of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants who travels through Tapachula comes from Central America, other inhabitants also open the doors of their homes to them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that he has fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children who were willing to blackmail from him without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula he asked for an accommodation and a unknown, a single moving, offered him its roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later the family lives and she tries to decide where the next step is going.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full again.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the courses, the travellers consult their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus arrived today and has brought 20 new guests, a large part from Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Ms. Ramírez seems happy to be happy that her house is full, but it is also nostalgic, because of them that went away.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother, she peaked in her album with many photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There is one of her daughter with African hair braids, who has made a client, some photos of their grandchildren and many travellers more, boy and old.</seg>

<seg id="1961">The inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minorities in the West of China are forced to install a spyware on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On July 10, the mobile users in the Tianshan District of the City of Urumqi received a mobile notification, in which it rejects the District Government to install a monitoring app called Jingwang (or "Web Cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "in the message it is said that the app" "" "is to prevent access from terrorist information." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">However, the authorities will also use the app for more than the fight against terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report of Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women have been arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh prefecture, because they had previously installed the app, news with a private WeChat Group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">"" "in the communication of the police, the app was to investigate the sources and the distribution channels of terrorists and, along with" illegal religious "activities and" "" "harmful information" "", "including videos, images, books and documents." ""</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is the block of pornographic websites, from online fraud, Trojans and phishing pages to help users to spend a lot of time them online and to remote control your own home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with the filters for minors should help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can naturally be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote control" state actors or even hacker tend to manipulate or steal the home network of a person.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While reports of digital censorship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in the bigger cities in the east and south, the reality is very often dark for those who live in remote, displaced ethnic minority regions like Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">To limit unrest and dissatisfaction in conflict zones, authorities are often correspondingly extreme censored and surveillance measures as well as routinous internet.</seg>
<seg id="1976">"" "the media outlet" "" "Images from New China" "" ", which publishes the censored news in China, shown photos from a checkpoint, at the police skipped the residents, if they had installed the monitoring app." ""</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian ensure that people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification required that people install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are detected at a check point with a device without this software, they could be imprisoned for up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback to technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They compelled people to use devices that are intended for older people.</seg>

<seg id="1984">"images from New China" (Written of the New Year of War) also published a Jingwang product description, from which the software can lift the passwords of a Windows operating system and thus gets unrestricted access to the computer's hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="1985">After the installation of Jingwang computers and mobile phones in Xinjiang become electronic handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The rules in Jingwang may have a reaction to the instructions of the city party, to minimize the distribution of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government branches, authorities, and with the party connected facilities including universities and research institutions are obligated to follow the instructions of Cybersecurity Office in operation of their computer and communication instruments.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The Jordanian Rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib spend most of his time inside; once again he kills him to his computer, to his computer, and again to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what you can rely on is a cigarette between his fingers or his nicotine abstained lips.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the top floor of his family house, which has belonged to them since 1967; the year, in which Israel had finished his occupation of the West Bank and Hdaibs family had been forced to flee from their village in Palestine where they had lived as felahyeen (about: farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For now six years, Hdaib is a passionate activist, who is transferred to the conservative majority, and her old proven opinions about gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression by art and rapmusic.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, often deals with themes such as Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugee, but also calls for the nucleus of the entire Arab world. all these topics are not only in his hometown Amman relevance, but also in cities leading up to Sanaa within Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">"" "" "" "with its 25 years, Hdaib sees himself as a man who is not restricted by limits, and it can be shared according to their own statement with people who have suffering from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya." ""</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he doesn't open it openly, he advocates a special envious against the US foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib looks at his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib did not believe that his sympathy for those who try to do in war zones, something with his identity as "Palestinian refugee" of the second generation, signifies himself even if he was born in Jordan and never before in Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think about my own lives so," stresses Hdaib.</seg>
<seg id="2104">"" "then he adds:" "" "I think, because I am a man," "" "while in water dissolved Nescafe in two cups. it is the holy month Ramadan; in this time it is planned for Muslims to fast-sunset from sunrise to sunset." ""</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also suggests that the public consumption of food is illegal during Ramadan.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously Hdaib has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee at a scorching hot young party did little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically, the slup lukewarm coffee and the squadron of the Kent cigarette into the nose into the first line of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky, especially when one cast a look inside the neighboring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Hence, you simply avored basic things to do - as in public during Ramadan, to drink water, not to land in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, the Interior Ministry of the Interior has cancelled the performance of the band Mashrou'Leila, for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">A number of parliamentarians supported by the Islamic state front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual frontier Hamed Sinno, contradict the cultural and traditional norms of the country and the main reason for the corporations I am concerned.</seg>
<seg id="2112">"" "the MPs and former spokesman for the Islamic Coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert" "" "had been cancelled" "" "because of the sexual orientation of the singer." ""</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many claim that commitment to the band's commitment in the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is a dangerous activism that raises the old trusted legitimacy of authoritarian regimes throughout the region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">"" "in a public statement, Mashrou'Leila estimates the Jordanian people as" "" "progressive supporters of human rights" "", "which continue to continue" "" "for intellectual and cultural pluralism." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement is probably not easy to be silky rhetoric, but actually a clear, crystallizing reality reflected in Jordan, which clearly occurs in Hdaibs factory.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016 Hdaib returned to body sex norms by reformed his vision of the fate of Arabic women, the vorehelichen sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The image shows the skeleton of a obviously cast unknown woman, whose arms and legs are lined up to the corners of the canvas.</seg>
<seg id="2118">She is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those who should really trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Over the past years, the number of 'Honour' of Honor 'has increased in Jordan - the unofficial outside.</seg>
<seg id="2120">According to Human Rights Watch the number of Honor of Honor in 2016 reached its climax; however, Jordan is still lacking that Jordan has become institutional infrastructure to support women, victims of attempted murder or domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2121">"" "according to a law for interruptions in 1954, women who are exposed to domestic violence," "" "to indefinite period in prison," "" "and for their liberation, often a years of bureaucratic expenses and the guarantee of the family is necessary that the woman will do nothing." ""</seg>
<seg id="2122">Hdaibs music enjoys great popularity and is well-known for it not to repay the issues in its country long as taboos.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib denies that his work is politically, however, that he puts his music that is full of explicit assessments on sexuality, freedom and expression, not separate from politics.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come out of the Middle East, Man.</seg>
<seg id="2125">I was inscribed on politics, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed" Hdaib takes the question of Palestinian identity.</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and in "Ghareeb" the focus again is on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">"" "" "" "the list of songs that are on the core can be continued." ""</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016, Hdaib published a song titled "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse repeats itself often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and every other is it."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"" "in the course of the song, Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market appearing in his words," "" "I can get what you want" "" "- be faith or failure, Hetero- or homosexuality." ""</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notices that hardly anybody in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and lesbians and that comments on the equality of LGBTQ + individuals were still heavily censored in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib performed an interview for the popular Jordan Onlineprogram Roya, around later that his comments were torn out of the context, distorted and his mind was censored.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was uploaded without incisions, but was only a revised version," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib acquires the Arabic LGBTQ + community and represent the opinion that intolerance towards homosexuals does not disagree with Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nuvo, a poet of the eighth century, who is still stuck today thanks to his homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks: if Abu Nuvo, who once again work on behalf of the Caliph, could write openly about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordan do not?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, I have nothing to do with Mashrou 'Leila, or the fact that the concert was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">"" "" "" "in the Hashemite Kingdom there is nothing new that the government has attacks on free expression and that progressive votes are to be silenced." ""</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian newspaper authority issued several former governors and members of the teaching authority, with the grounds that they would argue on comments in social media critical to the problems associated with deeply rooted in the land.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Given that, Hdaibs's opinion is therefore only the top of the iceberg - the real challenge is to make structural changes in the next generation of the Jordanians.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him, progress is a permanent giving and take. Jordan has stopped for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - so it sees Hdaib - consists of slow, bedtime and inner changes. it is sure that these changes will take place every day in the heart of the Jordanian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">In the end, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs also, dreams of a Arab world without interventions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">He is not only dreaming about bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to experience it. "</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region will converse through music, art and literature of a true and fundamental openness - and not by bombs, spreading unitions and to artificial nature. at least he hopes.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until it is done, Hdaib will continue to be rescued and therefore also resist resistance.</seg>

<seg id="2150">These big, extravagant warriors are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Nebuta Festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">It is assumed that there is a variation of the Tanabata Festival, which is usually also celebrated in August in many areas of Tohokus. a further theory has taken over for over a thousand years, and out of a time, in the north-east coast of Japan, to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region.</seg>

<seg id="2168">El Callao, Perus most important harbour, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, near the historical center of the capital Lima, a region with a very high crime rate, where road noise and illegal drugs are everyday.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region cannot feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time, Peru - how many other medium and South American countries experienced - rising demand for men's aesthetic services.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, appearance and therefore also the unusual hairstyles of famous sportsmen such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil), has led to more standardization in the experienced hands of hairdressing to make these elaborate hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairstyles that go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity, has even inspired an annual event, the competition of hairdressers "Batalla de Barberos," which has been held since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">There experts stand against each other in order to show, who can create the eccentric directives as you can see in the following video (more videos on current competitions there are on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions such as the school Augusto Salazar Bondy, who found himself in El Callao, found here an opportunity to exchange their weapons against hairdressing tools, and instead of bad advice to find training in hairdresser, which allows them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and the biocious opportunities, dozens of young people saw that she is able to seize a profession which is currently in fashion.</seg>

<seg id="2181">"" "the following article is the revised version of the" "" "declaration of love" "" "by guerrilla fighters" "", "which has published the international online magazine Tea After Twelve." ""</seg>
<seg id="2182">The post is published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people who know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not much more important, people who feel ejected to bring affection?</seg>
<seg id="2185">This question was exactly the question of the young Colombian activists Leonardo Párraga from the Young Youth Foundation and inspired her to campaign cartas por la recuronciliación (letters to reconciliation), the young people encouraged to write guerrillas letters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Recently, its country was the showplace of a historic event, and they wanted to contribute to their part: after years of negotiations the Colombian government had closed a peace agreement with the guerrilla movement FARC (German: revolutionary Armed Forces columbiens), which forms the end of the longest war in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">International was given the signing of the peace agreement as so important that the Colombian president José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits.</seg>
<seg id="2188">However, there is a long way ahead of Kolumbianians until one can speak of a real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrillakim, who lived for many years in illegal camps, were exposed to a war rhetoric and around the clock, having carried their weapons in themselves, must now re-integrate into the life as civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Columbian society, in turn, having become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hate to guerrilla fights, must support them in their ranks and support them when building a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Columbians have had to close together and would have to help with the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And this is exactly what they did: until now, thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former guerrilla struggles to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">"" "" "" "the aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for every former guerratic fighters - which will then be handed over personally." ""</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for reconciliation originated in the world summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in Bogotá in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to talk short with Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">"" "" "" "he explained that we will write to the man that we love thousands of love letters on Valentine, but those who need them much more necessary." ""</seg>
<seg id="2197">He said he continued to share his love with people this year, needed most urgent inquiries.</seg>
<seg id="2198">"" "thus, the plan, letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC will have to build their place in society and to build a new life." "" "the letters will show that Colombian society is ready to make a discourse of a common history of peace." "" "they say." ""</seg>
<seg id="2199">So far, more than 2,000 letters were collected during the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities throughout Colombia, such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'i'd never thought that someone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to the UN camp in Caldono-Cauca region on 19 March.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the Municipality of Cali and Leonardo from the BogotArt Foundation to the camps, to transfer the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC appeared as they had done earlier, to meet the commands of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they did not receive orders, but letters full of submission from people all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">"" "it was a very moving moment for everyone involved." "" "it is incredible how many different feelings you can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that lies in between," "" "the Political science student Manuela Jiménez Avila later." ""</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a member of the governor of the province of Valle del Cauca described this unforgettable experience so:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After passing the letters, a former fighter sled me through the camp of guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">"" "when I saw in one of the" "" "Cambuches" "" "(a kind of hut, in which guerrilla struggles live), I saw a guerratic fighters who wrote something." ""</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go in, because next to him on the bed a MGL pomegrangers, a lethal weapon in the Sleeping Beauty.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "and I said to him," "" "Hello, what are they doing now?" "" "he answered," "" "I answer a letter I wrote to me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"" "never in my life someone has written something so beautiful, therefore I answer it." "" "suddenly tears ran across the cheeks." ""</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him completely and sat next to the pomegranates.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was sorry, I was sorry for all those years of faithful companion of this struggle, and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he never expected anything else from life. he had the only way to preserve him and his six brothers in front of the Hungertod. "I never thought that anyone would forgive me for my fault.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society there, waiting with open arms waiting for us.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now, I have only learned how I have to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">"" "but now where peace rules, I can learn many things and work in dignity." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">At the beginning, students and some leaders of the FARC joined a discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="2222">Students were all grown up as already war and the FARC were already in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">Therefore the leader of the FARC said the history of the organization, its ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process: "for many years we experienced how to develop the social injustice on the whole Columbian people. now, where we have the opportunity to help us develop a political party, we can contribute to the society in this country.</seg>
<seg id="2224">"" "for a goal of this magnitude, it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles," "" "said one of them." ""</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">These people listen, which had never been heard so far and had no suffrage, and to know that the people I have seen often as monsters and even hate people with beautiful feelings, that were rotated by their lives and their environment was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country lives, hurt me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforts me that all people - also those who are killed and so much harm may cause us to teach us and give a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters answered the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo González, commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example Herío de Jesús Monsalvo, Archbishop of the city of Cali, following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The columbianians were prophesied that after disarmament peace would reign.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as there is inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment possibilities, there will always be people who are willing to raise up and protest to their rights. and that is also completely justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">We of the FARC now put peace on a policy without weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2235">Therefore, we call all defenders of peace - no matter which race, religion or ideology they belong - to get over all those who dream of a country in the war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifices, because we know from his own experience that nothing is simple. be the one among us who defend life as a basis of existence, many difficulties are impending.</seg>
<seg id="2237">There will be many obstacles on our way, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are obsolete, there is my male name on it; but the doctor understood and put me to the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very grateful to him for that.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time in his office, I got to do it with fear; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good man.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him that he is respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">I got threats last February.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote me - relatives, stranger, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The asked to send me back to Chechnya to prove that it was a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They asked absurd demands: some said to me, I have put it in, by running up through the streets; others wanted that I had not changed my sex in Grosny, that all my sex was not only bad, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have grain size C - what should I have to say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it is still hard for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some older people once talked to my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"" "they said to her," "" "You brought a monster to the world, which has not only begged your family, but the entire Republic." ""</seg>
<seg id="2290">"" "we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you must disappear from here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother became too much and she lay a rope around his neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily the neighbours came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At the time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved into an apartment and a few hours later there was a car with a darkened window and a plate plate with a capacity of 95.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After the third time, it was clear to me that there was a bit lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rightler friends checked the number plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you flee?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For safety reasons, I don't want to give up their names, but I will say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With her help, I left the country, but then something unbelievable happened.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can't comprehend how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Just before my departure from Moscow, I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought it without registering me, without ID, without anything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and thrown them in the trash.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked in the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered to a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card to my cell phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"" "at the moment, when I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message:" "" "you don't believe you about security, just because you left the country?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2309">You know our people know what you do. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Just to prove it, it is number 115. "</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine this?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">That was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in touch with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">However, we don't talk about gender equality, this is a table theme.</seg>
<seg id="2316">I still carry some traditional Caucasian elements in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">As much as I wish it, I can't overcome this spiritual barrier.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that while my mother is alive, I will do my best to hurt them.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chatting with camera, I really give a effort to look like the person to look at them from their past - so my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know something about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What are your friends, those who are the dorded?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report last week in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For me, I needed current information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who has one and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told that during Ramadan, he was not arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he did not lock out a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will focus on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">"" "so that my dear, they probably invite their relatives, take care of the problem with the affected person and at the end require a proof that the so-called" "" "honor" "" "has received through blood satisfaction." ""</seg>

<seg id="2331">"" "" "" "if, especially those who have no rich relatives or who have dropped from their relatives to place Kadyrows court." ""</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they are arrested there, so that you can present them as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">"" "say," "" "If they are killed, they will show their bodies in television and claim they would have attacked any village or military base." ""</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people were not simply disappeared, but submerged to radicalize themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this only a guess or have you a source of this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who imprisoned for one and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have vanished in this prison after their beard had grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has been nothing new of them since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply have taken them.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, this person was even involved when these people were involved.</seg>
<seg id="2342">However, until now they were not presented as bandits, but there were no reports so far. we suspect that such actions are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why otherwise could it not have been allowed to shave this man?</seg>
<seg id="2344">"" "do you know whether these persecutions and kidnappings of people who belong to a so-called" "" "non-traditional" "" "orientation, were already held in the past?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think that before 2003 I was already living in Grosse than I lived there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999 when the Sharia was considered, I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, it was much safer than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">Russia, initially wanted to lead us to "civil society," ultimately threw us back into the Stone Age.</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my brows were ripped; I had coloured lashes, bore tubes jeans and short tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Ministry of Safety of Sharia never pushed me a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Before the Russian theatre in Grosny there was a place where every night, especially at weekends, a whole group of people met me.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several benches stood, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people, met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We were never offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a Redemping: Kharda ma Kharda. that is, "Spotte don't talk about the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">People often say to children, if they make fun of sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so you simply have your eyes closed before you because they believed you were ill?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never insulted me, never hunted and never defeated.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this grace period last?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrov came up with the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 he began to talk about moral television.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He did not speak about us, but primarily about the behavior of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - you could feel how people started to change in the city.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Who was laughing and laughed before, wondering at once with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In time, I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home I could feel how the situation in the republic was steadily worsened.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you start now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month in the US.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that, I am still working as an activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organize Teetreffs, meetings, I realize them to hospital and help them to get food types.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I have no cents for this.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people myself when I revolt away.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslims and want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hiddenab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that's alright.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So is nature, it has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This is exactly the same as Chechens, who prophesy with foam before the mouth, that there is no gay ones with them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Dagestans have the Cabardinian that, the Russians also have which; on the whole planet it is - but not in Chechnya. "</seg>
<seg id="2386">I come from there, so it's annoying to hear something.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet so many men of the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practising Muslims who go into the mosque and fast during Ramadan - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">Do you know, many think of transidentition about men who love men and believe that you have been changing his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a truder.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different kinds of feeling to be exact, different life settings.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed for my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not if I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Sorry I'm going to be so personal here, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I am not sad at all. I just know that I am myself now.</seg>

<seg id="2486">To break the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If women want to make an ad at all, they generally receive support from the State.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases, women are also financially dependent on the men who abuse them. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit that victims of violence should be in case of prosecuting authorities.</seg>

<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media or not at all. this is a growing area addressed to the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">For the need of medical research, there are two reasons: to have a lack in the offer of global healthcare, many medicines and vaccines discovering the special medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have a major problem in the poorest countries of Africa, and lack of investments in the discovery of these diseases caused by the pharmaceutical companies.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Secondly, research, which is carried out by African scientists to develop their own research capacity in Africa. a greater role of science and technology can only be eligible for economic growth of the continent.</seg>

<seg id="2628">This post by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website Ensia.com, a magazine which reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been a salad since the 1980s in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company provides 114 varieties, such as outredded, the first plant, which were grown and consumed by NASA astronauts in space.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years, Morton's work was given only by its own inhalation and the question of how many ointments can get, limits.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000s, he noticed that more salads were patented and that he could not continue to brew them for breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2633">Patents are not only available for individual types, but also for certain properties like resistance to illnesses, a special red or green or crooked leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the past few years more such patents have been filed for more plants such as grain or cartottends. due to these trends, plant breeders, environmentalists and expert food safety provide food security for the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia-old tradition, Morton still breeds salad, however, it takes longer than ever since its work is still more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "it is as if a boulders would lie in a river, in order to paddling it." ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">"" "so we have to do that now, but it is a breach with the breeding tradition," "" "he says." "" "I think these patents will go far too far." ""</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if they stand before judgment, no one can breed a new salad, because all features are patented. "it is as good as possible and tries to compensate for those features which he wants.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, he is very careful and tries to use no material that is protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">He has also joined a movement that is getting bigger in the USA and all over the world: open source Breeding ("Open Source").</seg>

<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds rather as if the movement originates from the IT area and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The open source Seed Initiative (initiative für "Open-Source" seed) can be inspired by the movement for free "open source" software, alternatives to copyright protected software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was launched in order to ensure that some plant types and -gens may not be protected as intellectual property and can be used for plant breeders permanently.</seg>
<seg id="2646">As part of the initiative, called Ossi, US breeders can commit to that others can use the seed-free seed.</seg>
<seg id="2647">"" "however, this does not mean that they do not continue to do with their seed and sell it." "" "open source" "" "breeders allow to cross their seed to make such own varieties, and it does not immediately exploit - two aspects that are prohibited by many plant patrons." ""</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Dismal prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">The emeritus professor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi board member Jack Kloppenburg are control of seeds and the possibility to breeding new plants, both important for food security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Seeds plays a role in larger cohesions like biodiversity, rights of farmers, control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by using seeds with natural resilience.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg emphasises that the "open-source" movement does not work with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from organic farming or not. "in order to purchase our goal of ecological sustainability, we need to take control of ecological farming, such as such as farmers markets, should also know that the way it is bred to farmers markets, such as this vegetable is bred.</seg>
<seg id="2654">Nutritional sovereign without seed sovereignty is not possible. "</seg>
<seg id="2655">"" "the members of the Open Source Seed initiative are committed to providing other seed remain freely available. thus, their approach is to be patented in contrast, seed and plant features." ""</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk, as the available gene pool is due to the always numerous mental intellectual property rights to plant material, which is therefore always restricted.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, Executive Director of Ossi, has engaged in her PhD with genius variation in carrots and their availability. she found out that about one-third of all cartons is protected as intellectual property, which means that it can either be used for plant breeders either or not only.</seg>
<seg id="2659">There are still such estimates for other plants, but experts like Luby suspect that mass plants like wheat in even greater style are patented as lettuce or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A Question Of Visions</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are so bred that they have targeted characteristics - from such, by which their flavor or its colour improves, due to those in certain environments flourish and ripensions such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders is increasing by more and more patents. however, genetic variety is currently more necessary than ever before, since the changing conditions are much worse.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail, Monsanto's spokesperson in Carly Scaduto acknowledge that genetic variety is generally important and also important for Monsanto's activities. with a total of four comrades and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States, the company is committed to maintaining genetic variety.</seg>
<seg id="2664">"" "however, you will contradict that intellectual property calls on other breeders as" "" "patents and the protection of plant varietal innovations" "". "a patent is basically a plan that anyone can follow once the patent has expired." ""</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come with another method for the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Such protection does not inhibits innovation, but promotes more material and know-how to be made available to the public. "</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton looks different: 20 years for waiting, until a patent can ablish, makes certainly no innovations.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait so long to breeding plants that are adapted to the changed environment conditions, you have already lost the battle.</seg>
<seg id="2669">"" "the main argument for Morton is, however, that genetic resources have always been a common good and should remain:" "" "independent plant breeders neither have the time nor money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us." ""</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers to make their work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"" "this is what drives us, and it will be impossible for us if we do not continue to use the best and newest genetic resources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2672">In total, Morton is trying to patented the concept of the concept: "we do not really create the features.</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form it themselves and as breeders we have no idea how the plants do it.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeders in the U.S. state, Oregon and Ossi board member, there is another important aspect of the plant breeding: "those who breed a variety can also breach their own values in them.</seg>
<seg id="2676">"" "" "" "those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocular cultures, for whose cultivation are needed herbicide, breeds in its varieties of agriculture." ""</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is very opposite. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized companies (such people move on international markets, but smaller than e.g. Monsanto are) patents, create the most smaller seed companies, even without patents, either reject it or keep it for too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeding Frank Morton is looking for salads in his breeding garden.</seg>

<seg id="2688">At the beginning of November 2016, the executive branch of the European Union, the European Commission declares that conventionally, plants should not be patented. thus, they are allowed against the current practice of the European Patent Office, which allows patents on conventional bred plants.</seg>
