this is James R@@ isen .
you may know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times report .
long before someone owned by Edward Snow@@ den , R@@ isen wrote a book in which he was spectacular , that the NSA rep@@ ain@@ ted illegal tel@@ eph@@ ones of Americans .
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
in it , he describes a cat@@ astroph@@ ic US intelligence operation in which the CIA placed literally dra@@ fts for a nuclear bomb .
if the crazy sounds , you read it .
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who didn &apos;t like the chapter ?
the US government .
for almost 10 years the government was established against R@@ isen and urged him to call his alleged sources .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this train , he became a symbol for the government &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; government &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to condemn and spy journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to First Constitutional atz the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right if media does not get this information , and if they can &apos;t protect the identity of the patterns they give .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so when the government drew near R@@ isen , he did something that many cour@@ ageous rep@@ orters were doing before him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he refused , and said that he would rather go into prison . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen lived with the risk to go in jail .
but then , only days before the process , something extraordinary happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly , for years , it would be essential for their case , the demands of the government were dropped to R@@ isen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason : in the period of electronic monitoring , rep@@ orter and springs can hide themselves much less .
rather than to fail and take R@@ isen , you could also carry out its digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , cared for his calls to secret ,
just like his e @-@ mail , financial and banking information , its credit rating , and even trav@@ ellers with the list of his flights .
in the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling , a CIA wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lower and cra@@ cks .
unfortunately , this is only one of many cases .
President Obama spoke at his steps to protect wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lower ; but instead , the judi@@ ci@@ ary has condemned more than all US governments in front of him .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government moves to much of their work as secret .
since September 11 almost every article about national security was the result that a wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lower went to a journalist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so we focus the media work on the game that will be protected by the first const@@ itu@@ ent , because the government has always more possibilities to cut out all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but just as technology of the government permits the rights of rep@@ orters , the press can also use technologies to improve their sources better .
and indeed , they can contact the moment in which they contact , instead of the desc@@ endant , in the voucher .
today there is communication software which has not yet been written when R@@ isen had written his book , and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or telephone calls .
such a technology is a Secure@@ drop , an open source analysis system for W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower , which was originally developed by the Internet world , which was developed by us today by the Freedom of the Press Foundation , which I have been working further .
instead of mail a e @-@ mail , go to a news website , just like the Washington Post .
there you can upload documents or send information , as with any ordinary contact form .
these will then be encrypted and saved on a server to which only the respective News Agency has access .
so the government cannot proc@@ ure more information secretly , and many of the information they would like would be requested was not available .
Secure@@ Anywhere is only a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments of all over the world are developing new spy technologies that end@@ anger us all .
it is hard to make sure that not only technology men such as Edward Snow@@ den have a possibility to inform Miss@@ y . it is just as important that we protect the next W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the disp@@ rop@@ ing of abuse during the supply of soldiers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wants to tell of over@@ crowded hospitals . or the next environmental workers who strikes the alarm for the contam@@ inated water of Flin@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or a Wall@@ street @-@ Insider , which warns us before the next financial crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least these technologies were not only made for those who want to un@@ cover crimes , but to safegu@@ ard our const@@ itu@@ ent rights .
thank you .
&#91; on April 3 , 2016 , the largest data le@@ ck of history was published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; revealed that the rich and powerful &#93; &#91; enormous money sum@@ s &#93; have been hidden from Global Wit@@ ness to a statement . &#93; This week , we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness to have a statement of 11 million documents of the Mos@@ sack Fon@@ se@@ ca .
the publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers to companies such as Mos@@ sack Fon@@ se@@ ca and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up that ? &quot;
we actually see the e @-@ mails , the exchange of messages , as the whole system works , as it works .
this led to the first very direct consequences .
Iceland Prime Minister is re@@ signed .
there are also reports that one ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad &apos;s station@@ ery in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
it is claimed that a track of 2 billion US dollars on Russia &apos;s President Vladimir Putin leads to a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cel@@ lists .
now there will be a lot of rich people and others who are nervous on the next publication , and to the next revealed documents .
this sounds like the Plot of an agent or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham novel .
it seems cri@@ es away from you , me , ordinary people .
why should this be ?
but the truth is , if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not all their taxes , then this means less money for important public services such as healthcare , education , roads .
and this concerns us all .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revel@@ ations are phenom@@ enal .
in the whole world , media and leading politicians like secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens from a few minutes will be used to hide and hide their assets -- something that we have been discuss@@ ing and un@@ veil for ten years .
I think many people will conf@@ use this whole world very conf@@ using , and it &apos;s difficult to understand how this tax ha@@ v@@ ens work .
I imagine it always like a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe in front of me .
so one company has a company in another company , in another company which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind this commandment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be very difficult for prosecution and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters are . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think it is also interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the US .
probably because there were no more prominent Americans that occurred in these revel@@ ations , to this sc@@ andal .
now , it is not that there are no rich Americans to hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
however , through the principle , after which these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ bag Fon@@ se@@ ca has less American customers .
if we had a data le@@ ck of the Cay@@ man Islands or even of Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming , or Nevada , we would have much more cases and examples that have connections in the USA .
in fact , it is so that one needs less information in some US states to find less information to found a company than to get a library card .
this type of in@@ transparent in the USA has allowed the employees of school@@ ing to go to school children .
it has allowed to wi@@ pe particularly vulner@@ able investors .
it is this kind of behavior that concerns us all .
we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice here at Global Wit@@ ness .
how does it work ?
so , we sent a roof@@ ed investig@@ ator in the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator gave himself as an African minister who wanted to bring suspected money to the US to buy a home , a yacht , a private jet .
we really shocked us that all except for a lawyer &apos;s request could make suggestions as he could transfer his money .
these were all pre@@ meetings . none of these lawyers took us as a client , and of course no one was handed over to anyone . but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important to consider this as isolated cases .
it &apos;s not about a single lawyer , who made our conce@@ aled investig@@ ator proposals .
it is not about a single top pole , involved in a sc@@ andal .
it concerns about how the system works , through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability .
and to overcome this , we must change the rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this may sound very tri@@ cky , as if we could not do anything against it ; as if nothing could ever have changed ; as if it will always be the rich and powerful .
but as a born optim@@ ist , I see quite sure something has begun to change .
in the past few years we have seen more transparency , which concerns the owners of companies .
the subject found political attention through British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
since then , the EU cap@@ tures the national regist@@ ers at a national level , who is really behind firms in Europe and who controls them .
one of the un@@ comfortable facts is that the USA lag@@ ging behind here .
representatives of both parties have inserted a draft bill in both par@@ liament@@ arians , but this does not make progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see how these Panama @-@ disclos@@ ure , this massive insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , used as means to ensure greater transparency in the USA and globally .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness , this is a moment for change .
we need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind head@@ lights .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need managers in the economy , which arise and say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ transparent is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians that recognize the problem and use it to end through laws this kind of in@@ transparent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
together , we can finally finish this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing .
this is the story , as I almost kidn@@ apped and in the trunk of a red Maz@@ da would be .
one day after I had completed my design studies , I made a back@@ yard sale .
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stayed and looked at my stuff .
he bought one of my artwork .
he was alone in the city and made a road@@ trip through the whole country . afterwards he would go to the peace of peace .
I invited him to a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Where do you sleep here tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he made the whole thing worse : &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot;
and I thought : &quot; Oh , man !
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to the peace of peace , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans that . I don &apos;t want to land in the boot of a Maz@@ da !
this is a small trunk !
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard me saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How please ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at night I was sitting in bed , I star@@ ed at the ceiling and thought : &quot; Oh man ! what did I get broken ?
a wild stranger sleeps in my living room .
what if he &apos;s crazy ? &quot;
I got such a fear that I turned out of the bed to toe the door , and shut up my sleeping door .
but he was not crazy at all .
we are still in touch with us .
the work of art , which he bought from me is hanging today in his classroom . he is now a teacher .
that was my first experience as a host . it completely changed my perspective .
perhaps the people who were sold out as strangers in childhood , actually friends who were waiting for waiting to be discovered ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco I took the air mattress . &quot; &quot; &quot;
let &apos;s make a time jump , two years later ...
I &apos;m unemployed , almost broke my ro@@ omm@@ ates and rent is increased .
I learned that there was a design conference in the city at that time . all hotels were booked .
I think , creativity may create it , fear in fun .
I wrote to my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I persu@@ ade how we could make something about it . our apartment will stay with us overnight , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk , including a mattress and morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and created such &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep at the air floor for 20 dollars on the air floor .
they found it great , and we too .
I &apos;m sure our cheese ham @-@ mol@@ ds tast@@ ed completely different because we made them for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them through the whole city . when we passed our last guest , the door opened to the castle , Brian and I arrived .
had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent ?
things came into rolling .
my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ ade , joined us as developer .
we wanted to find out if you could make it a company concept .
so we presented our investors : &quot; we would like to create a website , on the people publicly posts about their private rooms , their bedrooms , their baths -- the kind of rooms , whose doors are made when visiting .
over the Internet , they can then invite other people to stay with them .
that will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited that the rocket would ign@@ ite .
but she did not .
no one who is still in comfort , would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because we have learned them all , strangers are dangerous .
if one has a problem , one gets on the things you can well . we could design .
at the Kunst@@ akademie , we learned that design is much more than just appearance and feel -- it is the overall experience .
we learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust between people who never met ever before .
can design afford such a thing ?
is it possible to create trust ?
I would like to give you a tasting , what degree of confidence we stro@@ ve .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comp@@ atri@@ cles .
thum@@ bs up when you &apos;re ready .
take your mobile phone in your hand .
now , I &apos;d like to det@@ ach your mobile phone .
specify your un@@ locked mobile phone your left seat .
this silent flight of panic that you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts you when they open the door the first time .
for the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to keep the un@@ locked mobile phone in your hands ?
most feel the responsibility .
so you feel the most guests , if they stay elsewhere .
only for that reason our company can exist .
only so , who has actually got Al Go@@ res &apos;s mobile phone now ?
could you tell Twitter that he can@@ di@@ des for the president &apos;s office ?
you can return the mobile phones now .
you have experienced what kind of confidence we want to build up . I want to tell you about some discover@@ ies .
what if we had changed a little detail about this experiment ?
what if your neighbor had imagined only once with his name ; if he had told , how his dog or his children are called ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; imagine you have 150 not@@ if@@ ications , they all say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he really can hold fast @-@ locked mobile phones ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how would you feel when you had to leave your mobile phone ?
because a well @-@ thought feedback system is crucial for the trust .
at the beginning , we have done some things wrong .
it was hard for people to leave negative charges .
in the end , we decided to wait until both hosts and guest books were given before we ordered them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we have conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we studied how prob@@ able it is that people trust one another , depend on how much they are at age and living .
a little unexpected we trust people most , which are most similar to us .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural social pres@@ etting .
it is exciting when you add the call of a person -- in our case through not@@ if@@ ications .
if one has less than three divisions , nothing changes .
but if you have more than ten , everything changes .
a good reputation of comm@@ on@@ alities .
so the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted pre@@ ferences .
in addition , we knew that confidence is dependent on how much you cost from themselves .
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
when you &apos;re talking too little , like &quot; Hi ! &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one thing is told , such as : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- -- the request is not accepted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so there is an optimal degree of op@@ enness , e.g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Britain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in your home ! I &apos;m doing holiday with my family vacation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how can I create it with design , create this degree of op@@ enness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text . we also give tips on which themes you should write something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help to overcome our pre@@ judi@@ ces against strangers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with which we hadn &apos;t reck@@ oned , the large amount of people who were more than ready to lay these pre@@ judi@@ ces .
here you see how many people take our offer .
there can be three things .
first : incredibly good luck .
second : the ti@@ reless work of our team .
thir@@ dly : a need that had not been covered before .
business is just very good for us .
of course there are times , if not everything goes smoothly .
there were guests who have un@@ authorized parties or rav@@ aged apartments .
hosts have guests in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked in customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the fore@@ front , if trust has been broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it hurt me if I only think of it .
the dis@@ appointment , which is heard in the voice of the c@@ aller , was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve .
fortunately from the 123 million nights , only a fra@@ ction had a problem .
for people trust each other .
if trust works , this can arise .
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even ended blood for the necessary operation !
here is its assessment :
&quot; perfect house for trav@@ ellers tend to tend to heart attacks due to sitting activities .
the area is beautiful and with plenty of hospitals .
Javier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real gu@@ ardian angels who save life , although they don &apos;t really know it right .
you drive one in your own car in the hospital when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want you feel lonely , they bring books .
they can even stay longer , without charge the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
of course , not every stay will run .
but these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
when I stum@@ bled upon this concept for the first time , I asked myself :
how does the idea of sharing with money transactions fit together ?
it &apos;s about an economic trade here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is simply just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; le@@ verage industry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the thing will not be justified . &quot; &quot; &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people are open a part of yourself , and that changes everything .
when you are travelling today , it is easy to compare with Fast Food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
what would be , however , if trips be a rich buffet from local impressions ?
what if any place you visit , one group there would have to wait a group there , to complete a thoroughly and one with a pub @-@ pent@@ ine quarter , from which one has never heard of ;
or if you could cook a five @-@ star cook ?
nowadays , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would like to share the apartments from scratch to inter@@ connecting them ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would have the thought of a shared part ?
I imagine cities which allow us society and relations , instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and waste .
the project has already begun in South Korea &apos;s capital Seoul . many parking places , which belonged to the government ,
were offered ro@@ omm@@ ates , students who were looking for a residence ,
were medi@@ ated by people whose children were moved out . there were incub@@ ators programs .
to finance new start @-@ ups in the share economy . today , over our platform alone 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will host a stranger to a stranger or even host .
so the idea does not seem to be so crazy as it was taught us .
we didn &apos;t re@@ invented the wheel .
hospitality was also available before .
there were similar websites before us .
so why does it work ?
aside from happiness and timing , we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust .
design can help us overcome the deepest pre@@ judi@@ ces .
I think that &apos;s amazing ,
down@@ right overwhelming .
I have to think about it if a red Maz@@ da goes past to me .
we know , of course , that design cannot solve any problem .
but if it could help us , if it had this great impact , I wonder why we can use design soon .
thank you .
what do you think when you &apos;re watching me ?
a belie@@ ver ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or supp@@ ressed , a bra@@ in@@ washed , a terrorist group ?
or just a delay in security at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t give you the blame for your negative impressions .
so the media people represent the way I look like .
a study found that 80 % of the coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show : the Americans mean , most would not know Muslims .
probably people do not speak with their ancest@@ or drivers .
for all those who have never met a Muslim : it is great to know you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee house -- double es@@ pres@@ so , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a special @-@ gym fitness fan@@ atic ,
and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslim min .
but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not so born .
I decided to do this .
when I was 17 years old I met the decision to ou@@ ten me .
no , not as a homosex@@ ual human , as some of my friends , but as Muslims . I decided to bear the hi@@ j@@ ab , my head cover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my femin@@ ist girl@@ friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the funny thing was : for me , it was a femin@@ ist declaration of independence , namely against the pressure which I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old , to adapt to a perfect and un@@ achie@@ vable beauty ideal .
I have not only accepted the faith of my parents .
I have been with the Qur &apos;@@ an .
I read it , thought after , posed in question , doub@@ ted , and ultimately believed .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
she was trust and slow dev@@ otion to deep@@ en with every reading of the Kor@@ an .
the beauty of rhyth@@ mi@@ k brings me tears to tears .
I recognize myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
had you ever made the feeling that someone you perc@@ ei@@ ves you fully understand , and yet love ?
it feels like that .
I later married and started , like all the good Egyptians , my career as engineer .
I later had , after my marriage , a child , and basically lived the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American dream . &quot;
then that terrible morning came in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember where they were there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; sitting in my kitchen , I sat at the end , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unlock &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was smoke , air@@ planes flew in buildings , people jumped out of the buildings .
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical failure ?
my shock turned into dis@@ g@@ ust quickly .
why should we do something like that ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I changed the TV channel and heard : &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; Muslim terrorists &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; Ji@@ had ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oh , my God .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not only my country attacked , but in the N@@ u turned me the acts of others by one citizen into a susp@@ ect . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same day we had to drive through the Middle West of the United States to move into a new city and begin to study course .
I remember how I was silent -- when we were silent -- so deep it went into my seat , and I feared the first time to be recognized as Muslims .
we moved to our apartment this night , in a new city , in which it felt like a completely different world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then , I saw and read the war@@ nings of the national Islamic organizations that said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be vig@@ il@@ ant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stay in well lit areas , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t as@@ j@@ ade you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed in the whole week inside .
then it was Friday in that week -- the day when Muslims gather to prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and again the war@@ nings said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is not on this first Friday , the mosque could be a target . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage .
the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered and I heard also of attacks on Muslims or by people who were held for Muslims , into the free and struck .
there were really bran@@ dan@@ es on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because people who attacked this country , have attacked our country .
I have de@@ pressed the rage of the people on the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to explain , lasting .
I have nothing against any questions , I love questions .
they are the accus@@ ations that are hard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nowadays we can indeed hear people saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; There is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when will we go ? &quot;
some people want to ban Muslims and join mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the USA .
it &apos;s only the question : are we v@@ icious , or ben@@ ign ?
you know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tum@@ our is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor is only holding under observation .
the alternatives are poin@@ tless because the question is wrong .
Muslims are like all other Americans , not a tumor in the body of the US , but a vital organ .
thank you !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , audit@@ or and Olymp@@ ion@@ ics .
will the closure of mos@@ ques make America safer ?
it might be a few parking spaces , but not stop terror .
regular visiting of a mosque is to consider people other faith toler@@ ant , and larger citizens .
and as a head of the police in the Washington region , DC recently told me : people will actually not be radic@@ ally radic@@ ally radic@@ ally .
they are radic@@ alized in their cellar or bed in front of a computer .
in the radic@@ alization process , one has noticed that he can be cut off online , even from their family , so that the person believes that the people believe that terrorists are true Muslims , and everyone who ab@@ h@@ ates their behaviour and ide@@ ology , is a betra@@ yer , or faith .
if we want to prevent radic@@ alisation , we must stop the people to go to the mosque .
some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS establ@@ ishes its brut@@ ality with the Quran .
as Muslims , as a mother , I think we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would add to their imagination , if one recogni@@ zes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x cl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ide@@ ology grounds on their &quot; Holy See . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if you throw a look at them , they don &apos;t throw them what they are blown in their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Scripture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality , which allows them to read these things into writing .
an outstanding Im@@ am told me recently an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she would have decided to join the IS .
I was surprised and asked him if they had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said the problem was exactly the opposite . every spirit , with whom she spoke , brought them into silence , and told her that their anger , their sense of iniquity in the world , would only bring it in trouble . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by anything , inspired by their anger , it was a prime example for the instrument@@ alisation of extrem@@ ists who spoke to a solution .
this im@@ am restored the connection to God and its congregation .
instead of acc@@ use them for their anger , he showed constructive ways for a real change in the world .
what she learned in the mosque , she preser@@ ves to join the IS .
that was an insight as the Islam@@ opho@@ bia affects me and my family .
but how does normal Americans look like ?
how does it affect each other ?
what is the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear every day to our democracy ?
a study -- actually several neuro@@ science studies -- show : when we fear ourselves , at least three things happen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we rather accept an author@@ itarian government system , con@@ form@@ ity and pre@@ judi@@ ces . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a study shows : when compar@@ ing test messages , in which negative agreements were reported to Muslim countries , rather military attacks on Muslim countries , as well as circumc@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not just a academic problem .
if you look when the mood against Muslims shot up -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terror attacks .
it happened in the ap@@ ron of Iraq and during two const@@ itu@@ encies .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror , as I expected it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can actually be a tool to manipul@@ ate the public to under@@ mine the foundation of a free society , which has reasonable and well informed citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we may feel it first , but the toxic air of anxiety leaves us all .
with the assignment of collective responsibility , it is not only about to explain themselves .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school .
De@@ ah was a athl@@ ete .
he was promising at the dental Faculty , talented , promising ...
his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous person , whom she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her to her CV . she was stun@@ ned and said :
&quot; when is such a young man a diversi@@ fied young man ? &quot;
just a few weeks after visiting Su@@ z@@ anne at her brother and his wife , her neighbor , Craig Stephen H@@ icks , murdered her , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who had been visiting the afternoon , as with an execution , after he posted remarks against Muslims on his Facebook page .
he was shot at De@@ ah eight times .
Fan@@ at@@ ism can not only be imm@@ oral but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
have we gone to the mosque ? we stayed safe at home ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let us say it and for us it was not easy decision , for it was because America we want to leave our children : one thing that we would control through fear , or one where we can freely practise our religion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we chose the mosque .
with our son in the children &apos;s seat we went silent , with high pressure to the mosque .
I took him out , moved up my shoes , went into the prayer hall , and what I saw , left me .
the hall was completely filled .
then the im@@ itation made an announcement , than@@ ked and welcomed our guests , because half of them were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hist@@ s , ath@@ ei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ credit@@ ors that were come not to attack us , but to teach us .
at that moment , I have collapsed .
these people were there because they had courage and pre@@ judi@@ ce and pre@@ judi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose in the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism ?
will you go on number sure ?
or will you connect to those who think : we are better than those .
thank you .
thank you very much !
Helen Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve .
but I wonder what you mean that you might say that you are working on a T@@ ED@@ Talk , a mind with deep @-@ fare , i.e. , an exception , and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t be fool@@ ed . I am completely normal .
I &apos;m not an exception .
my story is not unusual .
I &apos;m so usually how it is allowed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if one looks at the Muslims around the world , and I did that with the largest ever conducted survey to Muslims around the world , people want normal things . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I am an exception in any way .
if people appear as a rule , usually the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to rule .
HW : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what started as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ist is about to become a multi @-@ billion business .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . it is made possible in research institutions around the world .
before air pac@@ ket is entered into our social consciousness , autonomous fleet of flying machines in the F@@ RAC Centre in France was built live in front of the audience a six @-@ metre tower from 1 500 bricks . some years ago they started to fly with rop@@ es .
connecting terminals connect air devices high speed and acceleration on eng@@ aging space .
they can also build self @-@ resistant structures .
they learned to carry loads , deal with tur@@ mo@@ il , and generally respond to natural laws .
today we want to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the limits of possible flights in the autonomous flight .
with that a system works autonomous , it must know collec@@ tively , where in the room the mobile objects are located .
in our laboratory at ETH Zurich , we often use external cameras to find objects . that enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demos , we use a new location technology of Ver@@ ity Studios , a boom of our laboratories .
there are no external cameras .
each flying machine has internal sensors to determine position in space , determine calculations on board what the machine should do .
external commands can be found at the highest layer of eb@@ b . e.g. &quot; Start &quot; and &quot; land . &quot;
this is a so @-@ called tail@@ starter ,
a plane that tries to beat two flies with a f@@ lap .
like other Star@@ r@@ wing@@ ers , it is efficient approach , much more efficient than helicopter in all their variations .
in contrast to most star@@ r@@ ists it can float , and has great benefits at start and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always one side .
a limitation of rear @-@ star@@ ters is that they react sensiti@@ vely to turbul@@ ence like wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the flight device doesn &apos;t matter in which position the optimum position is reg@@ ained and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay .
during our research we often introduce basic abstract issues that penet@@ rate the core of the matter .
one such question would be : what is the smallest number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known as machines with thousands of moving parts that accum@@ ulate in order to hurt you .
decades ago , trained pilots couldn &apos;t fly remote @-@ controlled aircraft that had only two moving parts : a prop@@ eller and a tail@@ gate .
un@@ recently we discovered that flying with just one works .
this is the mon@@ osp@@ tic , the mechan@@ ically sim@@ pl@@ est flight device . it was invented recently .
it has only one moving part , a prop@@ eller ,
no valves , hing@@ es and trans@@ verse generation , no other actu@@ ators or control surfaces , only a prop@@ eller .
although it is mechanical simple , it happens very much in the interior life so that it can fly stable , and move over in space .
nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the tail@@ gate . to get there flying , I have to throw it right .
the lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood , it &apos;s right to throw me all , is slight , that &apos;s why I show you a video that was filmed last night .
if the mon@@ osp@@ ic is an exercise in pleas@@ ures , this machine is here , the omni@@ directional with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in excess .
what to do with all this over@@ flow ?
they see that he is very symmet@@ ric .
this is why he is ambi@@ valent in his alignment .
thereby he receives the au@@ sp@@ icious ability ,
moving in room to all directions , no matter what direction he is filming or even as it rot@@ ates .
of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers .
a lot is available in models , the rest is learned directly by flying .
let &apos;s see that .
when flying machines are to be part of our daily life , they must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine consists of two separate two @-@ prop@@ eller aircraft .
this turns into clock@@ wise
and the other against the clock@@ wise .
when you build it , they be@@ have like a high @-@ performance Quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
however , if anything goes wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller falls off , the electronics or a battery -- can the machine fly further if limited .
we will demonstrate this now by making a half fli@@ ght@@ less .
the last demonstration examined synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
the great number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a p@@ allet of aesthetic expression .
we participated in standard micro @-@ quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equi@@ p it with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
every unit knows where in the room it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore there is no limit .
hopefully , you motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to think new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine there is to be a flying lamp@@ shade on Broadway .
of course , it is difficult to pre@@ dict the influence of this technology .
for types like us , the salary is in the development and the work act .
it serves as a reminder , how wonderful and ench@@ anting our universe is , and that there are creative , smart bra@@ ids allowed to shape them in such spectacular fashion .
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential , is the bag on the ridge .
thank you .
1.3 billion years ago , two black holes cir@@ cling in a very distant galaxy more quickly , they turned so the mass three prob@@ es in a tenth place in pure energy .
this short moment , they lighten@@ ed bri@@ ghter than all stars in all galax@@ ies of the whole of us known universe .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but they have not freed their energy in the form of light .
we finally speak of black holes .
the whole energy was placed into space @-@ time encoder and the universe explo@@ ded in Gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we are defin@@ ing these events at the beginning of time .
1.3 billion years ago , a multi @-@ cell life was created on Earth .
since then the Earth has produced a lot of cor@@ als : cor@@ als , fish , plants , dinosau@@ rs , people and -- God rise to us - even the internet .
around 25 years ago , a group of especially brave -- R@@ ai Weiss decided to build a huge laser detector from the MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver from Cal@@ tech -- to look for gra@@ vit@@ ational shafts , producing black holes .
most of them held it for crazy .
but enough people recognized them as crazy geni@@ uses so the US National Science Foundation finance their idea .
after decades of development , design , design and extremely much hard work they built the detector Lig@@ o : the Laser Inter@@ fer@@ omet@@ ra Gra@@ vit@@ ational Field Ob@@ servatory .
in the following period , the precision of Lig@@ o could be considerably increased , which improved the recognition power .
therefore it &apos;s called Advanced Lig@@ o .
in early September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a final test run by some smaller , persistent problems .
on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after the start @-@ up of the det@@ ectors , the Gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ro@@ ared up black holes caused by the earth .
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hughes : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the leave of my to@@ d@@ ill father .
basically , that was the fruits of my life .
all that which I had worked is not longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes , theoretical physi@@ cist on MIT . he studied gra@@ vit@@ ational waves from black holes and their by ob@@ servatory such as Lig@@ o measur@@ able signals . but what are gravity waves ?
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a possibility in the structure of space and time .
by passing the shaft , the space and its entire content are stretched in a direction , stretched out into the other .
to illustr@@ ate instruc@@ tors in courses for the theory of rel@@ ativity often take a really al@@ right dance .
&quot; stretch and dust , stretch and dust . &quot;
the problem is that gravity waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous .
on 14 September , for example , every one of us was stretched down and gest@@ ures . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average human being was 10 high -@@ 21 .
this means 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1 . thus , the Lig@@ o staff announced for crazy .
with a five @-@ kilometre laser detector , and that &apos;s just absurd , this length should be measured on less than a thou@@ sand@@ th radius of a nuclear explosion . this is gr@@ ot@@ esque .
at the end of his classical text on Gra@@ vit@@ ation
described Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder L@@ IG@@ Os , the hunt for the waves : &quot; the technical difficulties in building such det@@ ectors are huge .
but physi@@ c@@ ists are fin@@ anci@@ ally and with the support of the public certainly all obstacles are overcome . &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to Lig@@ o . Scott would like to say Lig@@ o is more a ear as one eye .
I want to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavel@@ ength , which is much smaller than things around us : facial features , the size of your cell phone .
this is quite practical , because so you can produce a picture or a map of things by making the light coming around you .
it is different with tones .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
that is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot of things :
to the face of your child .
instead we listen to certain properties like sound and level , rhythm and volume to close the story behind .
&quot; now Alice is talking about . &quot;
&quot; and Bob breaks it down . &quot;
&quot; d@@ ummer of Bob . &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we can offer no easy images of objects in space with them .
but by watching changes in ampl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least for Lig@@ o the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble range .
so when we convert wav@@ e@@ pattern to sound , we can literally hear all of them literally .
the gra@@ vit@@ ation I can tell us about the coll@@ ision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has been busy .
S@@ H : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , just circular : w@@ up@@ p !
turn off the two bodies very fast , you hear the same cir@@ cus with an additional key change . that sounds like : w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u !
it is a kind of motion kit , shaped into the shaft form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I never forget -- heard Lig@@ o the following : &#91; Sur@@ render of the sound &#93; J@@ One knows what he has to hear , recognize this as the sound of -- S@@ H : ... two black holes , each 30 times as fast as the rods of your sh@@ aker .
AA : let us consider what this means .
two black holes , the di@@ ch@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 prob@@ es , the other with a mass of 36 probe , revol@@ ve around one hundred times a second before they col@@ li@@ de .
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know it because we heard it .
therein lies the permanent meaning of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o p@@ aves a completely new way to investig@@ ate the universe , as never before possible .
on this way we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible .
we can see much in all -- practical or basically -- not .
a super@@ nova , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ che stars explo@@ de in super nov@@ ae .
they are very useful . we have learned a lot about the space of them .
the exciting physical processes happen , however , in the core that lies behind thousands of iron , carbon and silicon .
we will never see through this op@@ a@@ ak are .
Gra@@ vit@@ ational waves penet@@ rate iron , as if it would be transparent glass . I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it , because the urine is covered by its own after@@ glow .
using gra@@ vit@@ ational waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
and the most important thing : I am optimistic that we have never seen in all things we have never seen , and of whom we have never seen . things we just discover by listening .
in fact , Lig@@ o found himself in the first attempt , which we did not expect .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Evans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says to this topic : ME : the type of stars that emphas@@ izes black holes , like Lig@@ o , are the dinosau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient body from prehistoric times . the black holes are so to speak for our archaeological work .
Lig@@ o enables us to make a completely different perspective on the events of all , to the emergence of stars and ultimately , as we emerged from this chaos .
AA : the challenge is now to be as brave as possible .
thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the noise of the cos@@ mos .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need ideas for new Ob@@ serv@@ atories -- a completely new generation of ob@@ servatory on earth and in space . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for what could be more beautiful than to listen to the urine itself ?
now is the time of great dreams .
do you dream with us .
thank you .
some time ago I tried a experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one year long I would say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feared that I feared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether it felt nervous , brought me in unpleasant situations , I forced me to say &quot; Yes &quot; .
would I like to speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
would I like to be on TV live ?
no , but yes !
would I like to start playing ?
no , no , no , yes , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : just to do what I feared , removed my fear .
my fear to keep spe@@ e@@ ches , my social fear -- pu@@ ff , gone .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes &quot; has changed my life .
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
but there was a certain yes , which changed my life deeply , to an un@@ exp@@ ec@@ tedly art . it started with a question of my youngest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the youngest , call for un@@ explained reasons all &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot;
as if it would be a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; I need milk for my c@@ abling . &quot;
she once asked me whether I could play with her when I was just on the go . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
a new way of living in my family . from there I was trying to play with them whenever you do so . no matter what I &apos;m doing , or where I go , I say Yes -- every single time .
almost . I am not perfect , but I stri@@ ve for a lot .
it has a magic effect on me , my children , to our family .
but it also has an intri@@ gu@@ ing side effect : only recently I understood that the &quot; Yes &quot; sessions will save my career with my children .
I have a real dream job .
I am an author . I think things off , we@@ aken for life .
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I create TV . I produce television .
I &apos;m doing television , in great style .
in this TV season , I am responsible for this to carry 70 hours of program into the world .
four TV programmes , 70 hours television . three to four shows are at the same time in production .
every show offers hundreds of jobs that do not exist before .
the budget for a episode of a television channel can be between three and six million dollars .
we say five .
a new episode all nine days four shows , i.e. all nine days 20 million dollars on TV , four TV programmes , 70 hours TV , three programmes which are simultaneously in production , time four , 16 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours TV ,
350 million dollars for one season .
in America , my TV shows were running on Thursday afternoon .
all over the world my series are running in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are shipments that I have created , and not only produced , so still is clean . I must find time , really silent , creative time to gather my fans about the camp@@ fire and tell my stories .
four television series , 70 hours television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fires that burn around the world .
do you know who else is doing ?
no one , therefore I am a Titan .
dream job .
I would not im@@ press you with it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I say it because I know what you think when the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; author &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; falls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I tell you all of you who work so hard if you &apos;re doing a company , a business or a household , I think that I &apos;m not only talking about my computer , so that I do not only understand my computer and I say : I understand that it &apos;s not going to dream about dream .
it &apos;s all a job , everything work , everything your blood , everything sweat -- no tears .
I work much , hard and I love it .
when I deep@@ ens in work , there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a land out of nothing .
it &apos;s when I stepped up the troops , I painted on a canvas .
so as a portrait of a high sound , a marathon .
you feel like Be@@ yon@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
she is creative , mechan@@ ically and rob@@ bing , funny and distur@@ bing , clin@@ ically and wise , cruel and r@@ ational , and the best of it is the sum@@ s .
there &apos;s so a change in me when work goes well .
a sum@@ s starts in my head , and it grows and grows , and the sum@@ s sound like a busy road , I could go on forever .
many people think when I explain to them the sum@@ s that I write about writing that writing is made to me joy .
do not understand me wrong , that does it .
but the sum@@ s -- when I began to work and work with the TV production started to work and work , create , create and work together , I discovered this thing , this sum@@ s , this energy . the sum@@ s !
the sum@@ s is more than writing .
sum@@ s is action and activity . the sum@@ s is a drug .
sum@@ s is music . the sum@@ s is light and air .
the sum@@ s is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a sum@@ s , then you cannot stri@@ ve different to size .
the feeling , not to be otherwise able to stri@@ ve for size , no matter what price .
this is called the sum@@ s .
or perhaps it also means to be a work@@ ah@@ olic .
maybe it is called gen@@ ius .
maybe it is the ego .
maybe it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I know only that I am not the failure , and I just know I love the sum@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I will only say to you , I &apos;m a Titan , and I know that I don &apos;t want to ask it in question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to make one clear : the more things I get , the more episodes , the more episodes , the more things more about the more work , the more things I keep , the more things I write history , the more expectations there are .
the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the country I create , the marathon , which I run , the army , the screen , the sound , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s .
I like this sum@@ s . I love the sum@@ s .
I need the sum@@ s . I &apos;m the sum@@ s .
am I only this sum@@ s ?
and then the sum@@ s stopped .
revised , over@@ loaded , ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated , burned .
the sum@@ s stopped .
now my three daughters are acc@@ ust@@ omed to the truth , that her mom is a single worker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ per tells people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My mom will not be there , but you can write my N@@ anny . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and Emer@@ son says : &quot; estim@@ ation , I want to go to Sh@@ onda Land . &quot;
it is the children of a titanium .
they are Baby @-@ Titan@@ en .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 , when the sum@@ s heard .
the sum of the engine stopped .
I did not love my work anymore . the engine was off .
the sum@@ s did not come back .
my sum@@ s was broken .
I made the same things as always : the same titanium work , 15 hours @-@ day , fixed weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , a titanium doesn &apos;t sleep , don &apos;t give up with all my heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no sum@@ s .
in me silence was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four TV programmes , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a fore@@ w @-@ Titan ,
everything was grey , I just had no fun anymore .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the sum@@ s and the sum@@ s was me .
so what to do if that is what you do , the work you love , suddenly f@@ ade ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know some may think , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Heu@@ l , stupid , the author of Titan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know , you do it , you &apos;re doing what you &apos;re doing to be a teacher , a ban@@ ker , a mother , a man knows how to feel the sum@@ s when you know the sum@@ s when the sum@@ s ever knew when the sum@@ s stops , who is it ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
when the song of my heart stop , I can survive in silence ?
and then my &quot; southern states @-@ wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; asked me a question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am on the way out to the outside and she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I want to say no , when two things are aware of :
first , I must say Yes to all and secon@@ dly , she called me not &quot; estim@@ ation . &quot;
it doesn &apos;t call anyone more &quot; estim@@ ation . &quot;
when did that happen ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hate it when I am Titan and my sum@@ s are sor@@ row@@ ful , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and so she says , &quot; Mama , do you like playing ? &quot;
and I say , &quot; Yes . &quot;
it is nothing special about it .
we play and their sisters , we laugh a lot and I read very dramatic from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot;
nothing unusual .
but it is outstanding because my pain and panic , in sol@@ itude and in the absence of sum@@ s , I can &apos;t do anything except to match .
I am focused .
I am silent .
the country I create , the marathon , whom I run , the army , the screen , the high sound - they don &apos;t exist any more .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all that exists is st@@ icky finger and hum@@ id k@@ isses , delicate voices , wax cra@@ y@@ ons and the song where it &apos;s going to let go , or whatever the girl in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Iron Queen &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
everywhere there is peace and simplicity .
the air in this place is so close that I can hardly breathe anymore .
I can hardly believe I at@@ me .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ sol@@ ves .
a mental door goes up and an energy ub comes in .
and that doesn &apos;t happen immediately , but it happens .
I feel it .
the sum@@ s is slowly coming back .
no full volume , barely there , it &apos;s quiet , barely audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there .
not the sum@@ s , but a sum@@ s .
and now I feel like I would know a magical mystery .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we &apos;ve forgotten .
the sum@@ s , the working sum@@ s , the Titan@@ ic@@ um , is just the replacement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if I ask you who you are , if I am telling you who I am when I describe my brain using programmes and television , and how working my brain is , then I forgot what the real sum@@ s is . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sum@@ s is no power and it is not working specifically .
it depends on the pleasure .
real sum@@ s depends on the love .
the sum@@ s is the current which comes from the life of life .
the real sum is self @-@ awareness and peace .
real sum@@ s igno@@ res the pressure of history , which to experience di@@ fying tasks , expect@@ ation and pressure .
the real sum is simple and original .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the real sum is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered to me the wrong words , for which God told me that I am a Titan ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is just love .
we all need a bit more love , much more love .
once my child will play with me , I will say Yes .
I usually do this rule , so I can free myself from being a work@@ ah@@ olic of all gu@@ ilt .
it is law , I have no other choice . I don &apos;t have any other choice if I want to hear the sum@@ s again .
I wish it would be so simple . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
play is not as possible for me , how to work .
the truth is hurt ,
but I don &apos;t like playing .
I am always working , because I love it .
I prefer to work at home than at home .
this conf@@ ession is painful , for what a person is working rather than to be home ?
well , yes , me .
hon@@ estly , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; --
I have to have problems .
that I &apos;m too relaxed is none of them .
we ra@@ ve around in the garden , and back , and forth .
we make small dance parties ,
we sing and play Ball .
we squ@@ ashed soap bubbles .
I feel mostly st@@ iff , absent , and confused .
I always grab my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
my children show me how to live , and the sum@@ s of the universe filled me .
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we stopped playing with the game ?
you can also say it ! always say Yes if your child wants to play with you .
perhaps you &apos;ll keep me for nai@@ ve , for a day@@ dreams .
you &apos;ll be right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you know why ? you &apos;re not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et Show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play with me at the most 15 minutes , until they expect to make something different .
there are wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes a lad@@ y@@ bug or bis@@ cuit replaced me .
and speak my teen daughter for 15 minutes long with me , I am the mother of the year .
it is only 15 minutes , no more needs it .
everybody can get 15 minutes on the piece , even at a bad mood day !
15 minutes on the piece !
no mobile phone , no laundry , no deposit .
the day is short : dinner , made the children ready .
but 15 minutes are inside !
my children are my bene@@ factors , my world . it must not be the children . it is true to feel the sum@@ s , a place for his peace .
it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about joy ,
to the &quot; games &quot; in general .
treat yourself to the 15 minutes !
find out what is good to you .
find out it and keep it .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I &apos;m more shy and I will be friends , reading books , enjoy the day --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is short for everything I have given up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in training when I wanted to sur@@ pass myself more and more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
15 minutes on the piece , why don &apos;t you treat yourself full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the sum@@ s came back in my spare time . sum@@ s seems to return if I don &apos;t work .
works doesn &apos;t work without playing .
it takes time , but after a few months , a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul . she keeps me back to new ideas . I use it in full trains and I love my work again .
I like the sum@@ s , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I &apos;m not the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s isn &apos;t me ... not anymore .
bubble and st@@ icky finger , dinner with friends .
this is my sum@@ s .
the sum@@ s of life .
the sum@@ s of love .
the sum@@ s of work is part of me , but just another part . and I am so grateful .
it &apos;s easy for me that I am a Titan . I &apos;ve never seen a Titan , who plays in Jerusalem .
I said Yes to less work and for more games .
and yet I have everything in hand . my brain is still working . my camp@@ fires are still burning .
the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children are happ@@ ier .
the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother .
the more I play , the more clear my head .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the sum@@ s . the land I create , the marathon , which I run , the troops , the screens , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s of life : the sum@@ s of life .
the more I feel the sum@@ s , the more this unusual , calm , bare and new feeling of life in me wide . less Titan -- more I !
the more I feel exactly this sum@@ s , the more I know who I am .
I am an author . I think things out , I wake up to life .
that belongs to the job , which means to live his dream .
that &apos;s the dream of this jobs ,
for a dream job should be a bit dre@@ aming .
I said &quot; Yes &quot; to less work and for more games .
Titan@@ en have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you very much .
I am neuro@@ surgery .
like most of my colleagues I have done every day with human trage@@ dies every day .
I know how your life can change from one second to the other , after a severe stroke or after a car accident .
for us neuro@@ surgeon , it is very fru@@ str@@ ating that the brain , unlike other bodies , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing .
after a severe injury of central nervous system , patients often have a permanent , heavy disability .
this is the reason why I was functional Neuro@@ surgical .
what is a functional Neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor , who tries to improve the nerve functions through different surgical actions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; surely they have heard of one of the most well known , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tie@@ cereb@@ ell@@ ar stimulation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; in this way , one finds a electro@@ de deep in the brain in order to influence the circuits of neur@@ ons so that the neurolog@@ ical function improves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is really an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Park@@ inson &apos;s disease which suffered severe trem@@ bling and severe pain .
neuro@@ mod@@ ulation , however , does not mean Ne@@ uro cure .
the dream of working neuro@@ surgeon is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion , we approach this dream .
I want to show you that we are very close .
the brain can help itself with something help .
the story began 15 years ago .
at that time I was executive and working day and night in the emergency .
often I provided patients with skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma .
they have to imagine that at the brain @-@ brain trau@@ mat@@ a stimulates the brain and the pe@@ eling pressure is rising .
to save life , you have to reduce the skull transfer .
sometimes you need to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass .
instead of throwing the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues .
what do I mean by this ?
we wanted to grow cells out of this tissue .
this is no easy task .
to make cells grow from a tissue , is comparable to very small children , which will be taken out of your family .
you need to find the right diet , temperature , humidity , and the environments to flour@@ ish .
exactly that we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts , Jean @-@ François succeeded .
this he saw under his micro@@ scope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked like a stem cell culture . with large green cells , surrounded by small , un@@ mature cells .
perhaps you still know of the biological classes that stem cells are un@@ ripe cells that can transform themselves into each cell type of the organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small niche of the brain .
it is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface of the brain mass in the OP .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die , they are immort@@ al .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they divided up slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
so we saw a new , strange cell population that looked like stem cells , but beha@@ ved differently .
we needed long to understand where they came from .
they originate from these cells .
these blue and red cells called Dou@@ ble@@ c@@ ort@@ in @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make up 4 % of our cereb@@ ral nerve cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the fet@@ us stage , they ensure the bra@@ ins of the brain .
but why do they remain committed ?
we don &apos;t know that .
we believe they are taking part in the healing of the brain , since we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries .
but this is not so sure .
however , one thing is clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells .
we stand before a potential cell source that enables brain healing .
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to remove a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ lingu@@ istic area and then to cultiv@@ ate the cells exactly as it did Jean @-@ François .
and then mark them in color to trace them in the brain .
in the last step , we planned them to the takeover of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ t -- aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we are not given these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we are not given the same cells in your brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller we could work with monkeys .
in the first scenario , we planned the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that after several weeks it was completely disappeared , they would go back home . the room is already busy , they will not be used there , so they disappear .
in the second scenario , we added a violation and were given precisely the same cells , and now the cells remained -- they grew up to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could watch under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that were not planned .
the evidence they show is these small points . these are the cells we are in vitro , in the culture .
of course we could not stop .
can these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained ap@@ es with a manual skill .
they had to take food pellets of one tray .
they made them very well .
when they achieved a stable skill level , we last in the motor@@ ised cor@@ tex the motor @-@ motor@@ ized area .
then the ap@@ es were paraly@@ sed , they could no longer move their hands .
exactly as it would happen to people , they recre@@ ate spont@@ ane@@ ously up to a certain degree , exactly as after a stroke .
the patients are paraly@@ zed and then they try to relax with the help of plastic bra@@ ins . they relax at a certain degree , just like the monkey .
when we were sure the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left hand , they see the monkey stro@@ ll@@ ing spont@@ ane@@ ously .
it can yield about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from injury .
it is not so accurate and not so fast .
now see when we were given the cells perfectly : the same monkey , two months after maturity .
I can tell you that were also very exciting for us .
since then , we have found a lot more about this cells .
we can freeze them and use it later .
we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for instance at Park@@ inson &apos;s disease .
but our dream is still to im@@ itate her in humans .
I really hope that I can show you soon as the human brain has the means to cure itself .
thank you .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Jo@@ cel@@ y@@ ne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure now , several dozen people in the audience , perhaps even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can &apos;t . &quot;
I definitely go .
of course , the question is what the biggest obstacles are , before you can start clinical trials in humans .
Jo@@ cel@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results , one has to complete about two kilograms of Pap@@ ers and forms to pass these kinds of studies .
BG : this is understand@@ able , the brain is very delicate , etc .
J@@ B : yes , but it needs a long time , a lot of patience and a almost professional team .
BG : take a look at the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it will take until somebody will come to hospital , and this therapy is available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
first , it depends on the approval of clinical study .
will we allow the authority to start it soon ?
this study has to be carried out with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to choose the patients to evaluate and evaluate the treatments , whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
you must apply this to a multic@@ enter study .
first , you have to really show that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone .
BG : and that &apos;s sure , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : Jo@@ cel@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting T@@ ED and that you told us about it .
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the West making a big mistake , of course to be considered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t see democracy as the frag@@ ile plant that is in reality but as inventory of our society . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we tend to consider them as un@@ changing conditions .
we believe capitalism is inev@@ it@@ ably leading to democracy .
that is not right .
Lee Ku@@ an Ye@@ w from Singapore and his great im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing have proved that it is quite possible to have a flour@@ ishing capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains un@@ democratic .
in fact , democracy moves in us , in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the beginning of the year when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was inevitable that the democratic process of our country -- was inevitable that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- not allowed to influence the austerity programs that are realized in Greece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that moment , I thought it could be no better just@@ ification for Lee Ku@@ an Ye@@ w or the Communist Party of China , or some of my sincere friends who would repeatedly have told me that democracy would change if it would change anything . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at this point , I want to introduce you an economical model for a real democracy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask you , together with me to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Ye@@ w , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group is a mistake , we could save ourselves democracy , but that we need a truly and def@@ ensive democracy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for without democracy , our societies are Gem@@ any , our future dark , and our great new technologies w@@ asted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the subject of waste , I want to point out to an interesting contra@@ diction that currently threatened our economies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I call it the &quot; twin @-@ summit par@@ adox . &quot;
one summit is known to you . they know and recognize him as the debt mountain that casts its long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognize the debt mountain ,
but only a few recognize his Di@@ dy@@ mus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a mountain of un@@ used cash , which is to be anxi@@ ous to invest there , however , to invest there where it would be productive and in@@ comes with which you might produce debt berg and also all those things need to produce urgently , for example &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I call them two numbers .
over the past 3 months , the U.S. , in England and in the euro@@ zone have invested 3.4 tr@@ illion U.S. dollars , in all the prosperity of producing goods such as industrial plants , machinery , office building , schools , roads , tracks , equipment , and so on .
3.4 Billi@@ ons US dollar sounds like a lot of money until you spend the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely didn &apos;t do anything except the stock exchange and to rub the real estate prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , debts and un@@ productive capital form the twin summit , which are not the same with the usual market mechanisms . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the result is stag@@ nat@@ ing in wages , more than one quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ old in the USA , Japan and Europe who would not invest a low demand that would not invest in which they would not invest in which they would not invest , that his son would kill him if he is growing .
un@@ will@@ ed the circumstances suggest that e@@ at@@ pus kills him .
this is my Ha@@ gel with capitalism --
&quot; &quot; &quot; his extremely dis@@ si@@ der@@ ous art . all un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , developing human talents , and especially those technologies , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; technologies that are decisive for salvation of the earth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
is democracy the solution ?
I think so . but before we continue : what do we mean under democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the social form in which the free and the poor as a majority control the government .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy , of course , got too many --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
however , it would be an error to reduce the significance of the ath@@ en@@ ian democracy due to these exclusion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decisive thing in the ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that she gave them the working arms , but not only the right to free expression of expression , but more important and decisive that they agree on political determination with equal voting in question of the State bel@@ ong@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy has not been held long .
like a candle , which is very bright , she is also burned out quickly .
however , today , our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies don &apos;t have their roots in ancient Athens ,
but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy focused on the free citizens and strengthened the working arms , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which ultimately was a stat@@ ute for rulers .
the liberal democracy was only possible when a complete separation of politics and economy is possible , and the democratic process was confin@@ ed to politics while the economy -- so the world of corpor@@ ations -- a democracy @-@ free zone became apparent .
in today &apos;s demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time , when this separation of politics and the economy began , an in@@ ex@@ orable struggle between the two , by the economy gradually under@@ mig@@ rated politics .
do you wonder why the politicians no longer like that ?
it is not on a de@@ generation of their DNA .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is because you can be in the government today and not in power , because the power of politics is ander@@ ed into the economy and the areas are separated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I mentioned my shar@@ ks with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is like a herd of prey that are so sustain@@ ably the animals of which they are nour@@ ished , dec@@ im@@ ated that they are star@@ ved at the end .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is similar to the economy that has under@@ min@@ ed politics as far as its self @-@ induced economic crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the power of corpor@@ ations grows , its ine@@ quality is increasing , and the managing director of the corpor@@ ations will be too anxi@@ ous to invest the cash of their companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the succ@@ es@@ ful of capitalism distri@@ butes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from democracy , the higher the twin tops , and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if that is true , it is obvious that we must bring back politics and economy , and it would be better if the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control , as in ancient Athens , apart from exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by the way , this is not a new idea .
the Marxist Lin@@ ke had this idea 100 years ago and it wasn &apos;t very good .
the doctrine of the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor only reg@@ ain a position as in ancient Athens , without creating new types of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is a solution : abol@@ ish the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low @-@ beam workers by automation and robots .
the problem is , as long as business and politics are separate areas , the automation makes the twin summit higher , the waste of the tw@@ inkl@@ es , and the social conflicts deeper , as it is -- already very soon as I believe -- in countries like China will come .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we have to re@@ unite the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economy and politics , and make sure we have the re@@ unified area of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that lets the film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appear as a documentation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the question is , therefore , whether capitalism is the technical achievements that he has produced , will survive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the most interesting question is whether capitalism is re@@ sem@@ bled through a c@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to those in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is similar to humans and to keep their energy into the research of the universe , or into a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ en@@ ians , or into a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ en@@ ians , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ag@@ ora &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in long talks the meaning of life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think we must be optimistic .
so what would it like to look like this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; like utop@@ ia instead of &quot; Matrix &quot; -@@ similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
in the practical implementation I would like to call you shortly , some examples .
in the company &apos;s area : please introduce a capital market where you are working while working and in which your capital will follow you from a job to the next , and the company -- no matter where you are currently working -- is property of those who are currently working in the company .
then , all in@@ comes from capital and rede@@ em and the concept of wage work is totally over@@ hau@@ led .
no distinction between those who work the company , but they do not work therein , and employees that work there , but no exchange between capital and work , no major g@@ aps between investment and sp@@ ars , and ultimately no emp@@ i@@ rical twin summit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the field of global political economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ask for a short @-@ term exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , which will be issued from the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interests of the entire mankind . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; imagine that the entire world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cos@@ mos , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in units of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cos@@ mos &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- and each government is paying the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the trading surplus of the country to a joint fund . &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine that this Fund is investing in &quot; green &quot; technologies , particularly in parts of the world where investment resources are rare .
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes had proposed in the Bre@@ t@@ ton W@@ oods Conference in 1944 .
the problem was that one was not the technical means to implement it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today we have them , in particular before the back@@ drop of a unified policy and business . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world I describe is at the same time secretary , where she pre@@ fers privileged persons , and mar@@ x@@ istic because they have buried the separation of capital and work in the tr@@ ash@@ can of history , and key@@ nes@@ ian , global key@@ nes@@ ian .
but above all , it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy .
we will wake up in such a world
or will we sink into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar di@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we decide politically .
it is in our hands , and we do it better democratic .
thank you .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you are described in your biography yourself as liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if something about what I just said , then Marx is relevant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reason for re@@ unification of politics and business is ... do we do this , technological development will generate a massive decline in overall economic demand , what Larry sum@@ mers referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; long @-@ term stag@@ nation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the transfer of this crisis , from a part of the earth to the next , as we are experiencing it , it will not only dest@@ ab@@ ili@@ ze our demo@@ cra@@ cies , but also countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if this analysis is true , Marx is quite relevant ,
likewise like Hay@@ ek , that &apos;s why I am a liberal Marxist , and how Key@@ nes , and so I am completely wir@@ l .
BG : actually , and now we are well too .
Y@@ V : if you are not wir@@ l , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosoph@@ ical statement -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein , who mentioned it . BG : in your lecture , you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday while dinner of the speakers you have said very clearly what you keep from the view of the West to China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a big degree of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies , we have the appearance of democracy .
as I said in my lecture , we have limited democracy on policy during the area where most of them plays , -- the realm of economy -- a completely democracy @-@ free zone .
in some ways if I may say so pro@@ voc@@ ative , China re@@ sembles that of the 19th century England .
for -- do you remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism to democracy - this is a mistake , historically .
liber@@ alism , liber@@ als , such as John Stu@@ art Mill --
he was particularly scep@@ tical about the democratic development .
what one can watch now in China is similar to the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to second .
China now decided to do what the West has done for itself in the 19th century , smells amazing to hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I &apos;m sure many list@@ eners are curious about their experience as finance ministers from the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I knew that this is coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later on the first half of the year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal view , and very disappoin@@ ting because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone ,
not only Greece , but the euro@@ zone ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; namely , let us say goodbye to the compl@@ ac@@ ency and di@@ den@@ ying that a massive refin@@ ement line went through the euro@@ zone , and continues to run sharp@@ ly the development of the whole European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we had the opportunity to open on the Greek incident -- the way , the first proposal was revealed to this den@@ ial --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to do it right . unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , continue to den@@ ying the den@@ ial . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know what is coming .
this is the Soviet Union experience --
if one tries to preserve a economic system that is not able to survive by political will and author@@ is@@ ism , it might have been able to catch a while , but if the change happens , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and de@@ structive .
BG : what change are you looking ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the euro@@ zone has no future if we do not change its structure .
BG : did you have any mistakes in your time as finance minister ?

if there is a finance minister , or any minister , who claims in office after 6 months , especially in such a split @-@ called situation , he claims not a mistake , then it is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the debt recovery at the end of February .
I believed that there was an hon@@ our@@ able interest in the bank of funds to find a common solution .
but that was not .
they just wanted to fall our government , just because they didn &apos;t want to deal with the tests that were running through the euro@@ zone .
they did not want to admit they had been cat@@ astroph@@ ic for 5 years a cat@@ astroph@@ ic programme in Greece .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
there is worse than the &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; none of the Tro@@ ika of funds imposed on us this policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This was a col@@ os@@ sal error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive t@@ ons of talks , you still seem to be quite pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone comes from someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my biggest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if they do not survive , they will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will not be cat@@ astroph@@ ic for Europe alone , but for the global economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we strike through ourselves the way of a post @-@ modern 1930 , after which it appears , it will be as well @-@ bear@@ able for the future of Europeans like the non @-@ European . &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : we really hope you &apos;re lying in this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you so much for T@@ ED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
of Roy Price , most of them have never heard , though it is likely to be responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for a lot of you .
that goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago .
Roy Price is an executive employee at Amazon Studios ,
the TV production company of Amazon .
he is 47 years old , slim , has an I@@ gel@@ fr@@ is@@ ur and describes on Twitter as &quot; Movies , TV , Technology , Tac@@ os . &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for making shows and content , which will produce Amazon .
of course this is a very hard @-@ fought business .
there are already so many TV series that Roy can &apos;t select any thing .
he has to find shows that are very , very good .
in other words , he must find shows that are quite right on this bend .
this curve is the assessment distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the valu@@ ation goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this rating .
if your show is rated at nine and higher , this is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
these are shows like &quot; Breaking Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are addic@@ tive to make your brain asks , &quot; Where are there any more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the left , here at this end , shows like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- that should tell you enough what goes at that end of the curve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roy Price does not worry about getting the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to offer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he makes more thoughts about the mean failure , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they don &apos;t exc@@ ite them .
so he must ensure that he is really on the right side .
the print is available , and of course it &apos;s the first time that Amazon is doing something , that &apos;s why Roy Price does not risk anything .
he wants to create successes .
he needs guaranteed success , so he won a contest .
he pic@@ ks up many ideas for TV shows and choose eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and shows them online where they can watch everyone free of charge .
and if Amazon does play for nothing , you get , right ?
millions of viewers look at these episodes .
however , they don &apos;t know they are watched at watching this shows .
they are watched by Roy and his team who record everything .
you can capture when you start the show when you p@@ auses which parts you ski@@ ps or check again .
they collect millions of data to decide with these data , which show they should produce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , they process the data , process these and draw the answer , and this reads : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com on four rep@@ ubli@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they did this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn &apos;t so good .
it &apos;s just an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7,4 is and Alpha house lan@@ det out at 7,5 -- so something over the average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked .
at the same time at another company another manager has placed a top @-@ show through data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always searching for this a super @-@ show and he also uses data for it , but it does something different .
instead of organizing a contest , he and his team saw the existing data on the Net@@ fli@@ x viewer , so the reviews they show the shows , their course , which shows they like etc .
then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience : what shows they like what actors , which actors .
when they had together all the parts , they went a car and decided not to make a Sit@@ com about four sen@@ ators but a drama series about a Senator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has hit a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9.1 valu@@ ation on this bend . so exactly where they wanted to go .
of course the question is : what happened here ?
one has two very kno@@ wle@@ d@@ geable , data reversible firms .
they connect these many data and it works super for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is that ?
because logic suggests that it should work with everything .
if one collec@@ ts millions of data , for a decision which is required , then you should make a good decision .
you have 200 years of statistics as a back @-@ up .
you are optimized it by very powerful computers .
the minimum thing you can expect is good television , or ?
if data analysis did not work , then this is a bit sc@@ ary because we are living in a time , in which we find more and more statistics about meeting serious decisions , far beyond the television .
does anyone know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
nobody . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one comes in touch with this software . come in touch with this software . come in touch with this software .
if someone is in jail here and is asking for release , it is likely that data analysis of this company is used to determine if a release is done or not .
just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of decide whether a show is good or bad , it is decided whether a person will be good or bad .
medi@@ o@@ cr@@ e TV , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many dates ,
not always the best results are created . it &apos;s not that a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
even the data loss firms are also wrong .
yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes .
in 2009 , Google became known that they can pre@@ dict data analysis out@@ breaks of flu , the trim way -- by data analysis of the Google research .
it worked wonderfully and was a great news . the success cul@@ min@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
it worked well , year around year , until it suddenly didn &apos;t work anymore ,
and nobody could say why .
it simply did not work , this was once again a sensation , including the publishing of the publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
even the data have experienced firms such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
in spite of these errors , data will be reflected in the decisions of life -- at work , in law , in medicine .
so , we should make sure that data are helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in the computer@@ ized genetics -- an area where some very clever people un@@ imagin@@ ably many data to make serious decisions as the decision for cancer therapy
or the development of a drug . over the years I have recognized some samples on the difference between successful decisions based on data and un@@ successful decisions . this pattern was to be extended .
if you have to solve a complex problem , do mainly two things :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first cut this issue into his individual parts , so you can analyse the individual parts ; as a second , put the items together again to summar@@ ize a decision . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together .
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are just good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to cut a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to put the parts back and then come to a decision .
there is another tool , and we all have it : our brain .
if there is something which is good in which the brain is good , it is parts and pieces to summar@@ ize , even if the information is incomplete , in order to be a good decision -- especially when the brain is an expert .
that &apos;s why I think it was Net@@ fli@@ x so successful because they used data and minds , where they also belong in the process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they use data to better understand their audience because otherwise they would not have been able to put together all those parts , and make it a show as &quot; House of Cards &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which does not stand in the data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , which meant that they entered a big personal risk with this decision .
Amazon on the other hand did this in the wrong way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they used data to control all their decisions first , first as they bet on TV ideas , then they chose &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alpha Game &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a show . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe decision because they could always say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they tell us the data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data is helpful for better decisions but I think things go wrong when data start to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data is just a tool , and in order not to forget , this device is quite useful .
many of you will ...
before there was data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or No @-@ Question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most likely &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- right here at this moment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I will later viol@@ ate it with a technical demo .
I &apos;ve met some decisions in my life so far , where I should have listened to the ball .
but , as you can , of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace them by something much more sophisticated , such as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change basic construction .
maybe the ball will cla@@ ve and wis@@ er and cl@@ am@@ ers . in the end , it &apos;s easy to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn .
and I think this is very encour@@ aging , that in spite of the great amount of data still pays out decisions , make decisions to be an expert in which you are doing , and risks to enter .
because at the end , it is not the data , but the risks involved with which you land at the right end of the curve .
thank you very much .
