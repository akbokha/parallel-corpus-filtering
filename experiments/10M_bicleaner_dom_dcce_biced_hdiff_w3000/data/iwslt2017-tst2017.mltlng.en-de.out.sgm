<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You may know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times report.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before someone owned by Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he was spectacular, that the NSA repainted illegal telephones of Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In it, he describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation in which the CIA placed literally drafts for a nuclear bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If the crazy sounds, you read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who didn't like the chapter?</seg>
<seg id="9">The US government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For almost 10 years the government was established against Risen and urged him to call his alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "in this train, he became a symbol for the government" "" "government" "" "to condemn and spy journalists." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">According to First Constitutional atz the media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right if media does not get this information, and if they can't protect the identity of the patterns they give.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "so when the government drew near Risen, he did something that many courageous reporters were doing before him," "" "he refused, and said that he would rather go into prison." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">So from 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk to go in jail.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, only days before the process, something extraordinary happened.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "suddenly, for years, it would be essential for their case, the demands of the government were dropped to Risen." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the period of electronic monitoring, reporter and springs can hide themselves much less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rather than to fail and take Risen, you could also carry out its digital footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigators, without his consent, cared for his calls to secret,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like his e-mail, financial and banking information, its credit rating, and even travellers with the list of his flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistleblower and cracks.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately, this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama spoke at his steps to protect whistleblower; but instead, the judiciary has condemned more than all US governments in front of him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government moves to much of their work as secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11 almost every article about national security was the result that a whistleblower went to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "" "" "so we focus the media work on the game that will be protected by the first constituent, because the government has always more possibilities to cut out all." ""</seg>
<seg id="28">But just as technology of the government permits the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to improve their sources better.</seg>
<seg id="29">And indeed, they can contact the moment in which they contact, instead of the descendant, in the voucher.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today there is communication software which has not yet been written when Risen had written his book, and it is much safer than normal e-mails or telephone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such a technology is a Securedrop, an open source analysis system for Whistleblower, which was originally developed by the Internet world, which was developed by us today by the Freedom of the Press Foundation, which I have been working further.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of mail a e-mail, go to a news website, just like the Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send information, as with any ordinary contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These will then be encrypted and saved on a server to which only the respective News Agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government cannot procure more information secretly, and many of the information they would like would be requested was not available.</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureAnywhere is only a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments of all over the world are developing new spy technologies that endanger us all.</seg>
<seg id="38">It is hard to make sure that not only technology men such as Edward Snowden have a possibility to inform Missy. it is just as important that we protect the next Whistleblower,</seg>
<seg id="39">"" "" "" "the disproping of abuse during the supply of soldiers" "" "wants to tell of overcrowded hospitals. or the next environmental workers who strikes the alarm for the contaminated water of Flint." "" "or a Wallstreet-Insider, which warns us before the next financial crisis." ""</seg>
<seg id="40">At least these technologies were not only made for those who want to uncover crimes, but to safeguard our constituent rights.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on April 3, 2016, the largest data leck of history was published.] [the "Panama Papers" revealed that the rich and powerful] [enormous money sums] have been hidden from Global Witness to a statement.] This week, we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness to have a statement of 11 million documents of the Mossack Fonseca.</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">We get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers to companies such as Mossack Fonseca and say: "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up that?"</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see the e-mails, the exchange of messages, as the whole system works, as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This led to the first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland Prime Minister is resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that one ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad's stationery in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is claimed that a track of 2 billion US dollars on Russia's President Vladimir Putin leads to a close friend of children's days, a famous cellists.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of rich people and others who are nervous on the next publication, and to the next revealed documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">This sounds like the Plot of an agent or a John-Grisham novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems cries away from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should this be?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is, if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax havens and not all their taxes, then this means less money for important public services such as healthcare, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And this concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">In the whole world, media and leading politicians like secret tax havens from a few minutes will be used to hide and hide their assets -- something that we have been discussing and unveil for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people will confuse this whole world very confusing, and it's difficult to understand how this tax havens work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I imagine it always like a Matrjoschkapuppe in front of me.</seg>
<seg id="60">So one company has a company in another company, in another company which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind this commandment.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "it can be very difficult for prosecution and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters are." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">I think it is also interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the US.</seg>
<seg id="63">Probably because there were no more prominent Americans that occurred in these revelations, to this scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">Now, it is not that there are no rich Americans to hide their assets in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">However, through the principle, after which these tax havens work, Mosbag Fonseca has less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a data leck of the Cayman Islands or even of Delaware, Wyoming, or Nevada, we would have much more cases and examples that have connections in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, it is so that one needs less information in some US states to find less information to found a company than to get a library card.</seg>
<seg id="68">This type of intransparent in the USA has allowed the employees of schooling to go to school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has allowed to wipe particularly vulnerable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">We wanted to find out how all this looks in practice here at Global Witness.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So, we sent a roofed investigator in the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator gave himself as an African minister who wanted to bring suspected money to the US to buy a home, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">We really shocked us that all except for a lawyer's request could make suggestions as he could transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">These were all premeetings. none of these lawyers took us as a client, and of course no one was handed over to anyone. but it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this as isolated cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">It's not about a single lawyer, who made our concealed investigator proposals.</seg>
<seg id="79">It is not about a single top pole, involved in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">It concerns about how the system works, through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">And to overcome this, we must change the rules.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior difficult." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">This may sound very tricky, as if we could not do anything against it; as if nothing could ever have changed; as if it will always be the rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a born optimist, I see quite sure something has begun to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">In the past few years we have seen more transparency, which concerns the owners of companies.</seg>
<seg id="86">The subject found political attention through British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then, the EU captures the national registers at a national level, who is really behind firms in Europe and who controls them.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the uncomfortable facts is that the USA lagging behind here.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties have inserted a draft bill in both parliamentarians, but this does not make progress we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how these Panama-disclosure, this massive insight into the world of tax havens, used as means to ensure greater transparency in the USA and globally.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness, this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind headlights.</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "we need managers in the economy, which arise and say," "" "Intransparent is not good for business." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "we need leading politicians that recognize the problem and use it to end through laws this kind of intransparent." ""</seg>
<seg id="95">Together, we can finally finish this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering.</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story, as I almost kidnapped and in the trunk of a red Mazda would be.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after I had completed my design studies, I made a backyard sale.</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stayed and looked at my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my artwork.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and made a roadtrip through the whole country. afterwards he would go to the peace of peace.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "while we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him," "" "Where do you sleep here tonight?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">He made the whole thing worse: "I don't know yet."</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought: "Oh, man!</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just got to know him! he says he would go to the peace of peace, but I don't know if he really plans that. I don't want to land in the boot of a Mazda!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "then I heard me saying," "" "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "a voice in my head said," "" "How please?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">At night I was sitting in bed, I stared at the ceiling and thought: "Oh man! what did I get broken?</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild stranger sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he's crazy? "</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fear that I turned out of the bed to toe the door, and shut up my sleeping door.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in touch with us.</seg>
<seg id="119">The work of art, which he bought from me is hanging today in his classroom. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">That was my first experience as a host. it completely changed my perspective.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people who were sold out as strangers in childhood, actually friends who were waiting for waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">"" "" "" "people on my air mattress was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco I took the air mattress." ""</seg>
<seg id="123">Let's make a time jump, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I'm unemployed, almost broke my roommates and rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that there was a design conference in the city at that time. all hotels were booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think, creativity may create it, fear in fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote to my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky: "Brian, I persuade how we could make something about it. our apartment will stay with us overnight, Wi-Fi and a desk, including a mattress and morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and created such "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep at the air floor for 20 dollars on the air floor.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it great, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure our cheese ham-molds tasted completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them through the whole city. when we passed our last guest, the door opened to the castle, Brian and I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came into rolling.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former roommate, Nate Blecharade, joined us as developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if you could make it a company concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">So we presented our investors: "we would like to create a website, on the people publicly posts about their private rooms, their bedrooms, their baths -- the kind of rooms, whose doors are made when visiting.</seg>
<seg id="139">Over the Internet, they can then invite other people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">That will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited that the rocket would ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But she did not.</seg>
<seg id="143">No one who is still in comfort, would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we have learned them all, strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If one has a problem, one gets on the things you can well. we could design.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Kunstakademie, we learned that design is much more than just appearance and feel -- it is the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust between people who never met ever before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design afford such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a tasting, what degree of confidence we strove.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your compatricles.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you're ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone in your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now, I'd like to detach your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Specify your unlocked mobile phone your left seat.</seg>
<seg id="157">This silent flight of panic that you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts you when they open the door the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">For the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to keep the unlocked mobile phone in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">So you feel the most guests, if they stay elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for that reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Only so, who has actually got Al Gores's mobile phone now?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you tell Twitter that he candides for the president's office?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can return the mobile phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have experienced what kind of confidence we want to build up. I want to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail about this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor had imagined only once with his name; if he had told, how his dog or his children are called?</seg>
<seg id="170">"" "imagine you have 150 notifications, they all say:" "" "he really can hold fast-locked mobile phones!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when you had to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well-thought feedback system is crucial for the trust.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning, we have done some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for people to leave negative charges.</seg>
<seg id="175">In the end, we decided to wait until both hosts and guest books were given before we ordered them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We have conducted a study with Stanford. we studied how probable it is that people trust one another, depend on how much they are at age and living.</seg>
<seg id="178">A little unexpected we trust people most, which are most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social presetting.</seg>
<seg id="181">It is exciting when you add the call of a person -- in our case through notifications.</seg>
<seg id="182">If one has less than three divisions, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But if you have more than ten, everything changes.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation of commonalities.</seg>
<seg id="185">So the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">In addition, we knew that confidence is dependent on how much you cost from themselves.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">When you're talking too little, like "Hi!" you don't get an answer.</seg>
<seg id="189">"" "one thing is told, such as:" "" "I have problems with my mother" "" "-- -- the request is not accepted." ""</seg>
<seg id="190">"" "so there is an optimal degree of openness, e.g." "" "Great Britain" "" "in your home! I'm doing holiday with my family vacation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="191">How can I create it with design, create this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text. we also give tips on which themes you should write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">"" "" "" "our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudices against strangers." ""</seg>
<seg id="194">With which we hadn't reckoned, the large amount of people who were more than ready to lay these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people take our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">There can be three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: incredibly good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Thirdly: a need that had not been covered before.</seg>
<seg id="200">Business is just very good for us.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there are times, if not everything goes smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have unauthorized parties or ravaged apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked in customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the forefront, if trust has been broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it hurt me if I only think of it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment, which is heard in the voice of the caller, was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately from the 123 million nights, only a fraction had a problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">For people trust each other.</seg>
<seg id="210">If trust works, this can arise.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holidays in Uruguay. he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even ended blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is its assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect house for travellers tend to tend to heart attacks due to sitting activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and with plenty of hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels who save life, although they don't really know it right.</seg>
<seg id="218">You drive one in your own car in the hospital when you die, and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want you feel lonely, they bring books.</seg>
<seg id="220">They can even stay longer, without charge the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">Of course, not every stay will run.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I stumbled upon this concept for the first time, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing with money transactions fit together?</seg>
<seg id="226">It's about an economic trade here.</seg>
<seg id="227">"" "but it is simply just" "" "leverage industry" "", "the thing will not be justified." ""</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People are open a part of yourself, and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">When you are travelling today, it is easy to compare with Fast Food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">What would be, however, if trips be a rich buffet from local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if any place you visit, one group there would have to wait a group there, to complete a thoroughly and one with a pub-pentine quarter, from which one has never heard of;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could cook a five-star cook?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would like to share the apartments from scratch to interconnecting them?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would have the thought of a shared part?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities which allow us society and relations, instead of loneliness and waste.</seg>
<seg id="239">The project has already begun in South Korea's capital Seoul. many parking places, which belonged to the government,</seg>
<seg id="240">Were offered roommates, students who were looking for a residence,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were mediated by people whose children were moved out. there were incubators programs.</seg>
<seg id="242">To finance new start-ups in the share economy. today, over our platform alone 785 000 people in 191 countries will host a stranger to a stranger or even host.</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea does not seem to be so crazy as it was taught us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We didn't reinvented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality was also available before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar websites before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why does it work?</seg>
<seg id="248">Aside from happiness and timing, we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome the deepest prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I think that's amazing,</seg>
<seg id="251">Downright overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it if a red Mazda goes past to me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We know, of course, that design cannot solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us, if it had this great impact, I wonder why we can use design soon.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think when you're watching me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or suppressed, a brainwashed, a terrorist group?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or just a delay in security at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't give you the blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media people represent the way I look like.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study found that 80% of the coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: the Americans mean, most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people do not speak with their ancestor drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For all those who have never met a Muslim: it is great to know you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee house -- double espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted,</seg>
<seg id="271">A special-gym fitness fanatic,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing, spiritual Muslim min.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not like Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I was not so born.</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to do this.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17 years old I met the decision to outen me.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as a homosexual human, as some of my friends, but as Muslims. I decided to bear the hijab, my head cover.</seg>
<seg id="277">"" "my feminist girlfriends were horrified:" "" "why do you suppress yourself?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="278">The funny thing was: for me, it was a feminist declaration of independence, namely against the pressure which I felt as 17-year-old, to adapt to a perfect and unachievable beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only accepted the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have been with the Qur'an.</seg>

<seg id="322">Some people want to ban Muslims and join mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">It's only the question: are we vicious, or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">You know: a malignant tumour is removed as a whole and a benign tumor is only holding under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">Muslims are like all other Americans, not a tumor in the body of the US, but a vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, auditor and Olympionics.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques make America safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">It might be a few parking spaces, but not stop terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">Regular visiting of a mosque is to consider people other faith tolerant, and larger citizens.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as a head of the police in the Washington region, DC recently told me: people will actually not be radically radically radically.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalized in their cellar or bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">In the radicalization process, one has noticed that he can be cut off online, even from their family, so that the person believes that the people believe that terrorists are true Muslims, and everyone who abhates their behaviour and ideology, is a betrayer, or faith.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent radicalisation, we must stop the people to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group like the IS establishes its brutality with the Quran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As Muslims, as a mother, I think we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add to their imagination, if one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku-Klux clan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology grounds on their "Holy See."</seg>
<seg id="344">"" "but if you throw a look at them, they don't throw them what they are blown in their" "" "Holy Scripture." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality, which allows them to read these things into writing.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam told me recently an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she would have decided to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was surprised and asked him if they had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">"" "he said the problem was exactly the opposite. every spirit, with whom she spoke, brought them into silence, and told her that their anger, their sense of iniquity in the world, would only bring it in trouble." ""</seg>
<seg id="350">By anything, inspired by their anger, it was a prime example for the instrumentalisation of extremists who spoke to a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This imam restored the connection to God and its congregation.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of accuse them for their anger, he showed constructive ways for a real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque, she preserves to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">That was an insight as the Islamophobia affects me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does normal Americans look like?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect each other?</seg>
<seg id="357">What is the 24-hour consumption of fear every day to our democracy?</seg>
<seg id="358">A study -- actually several neuroscience studies -- show: when we fear ourselves, at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">"" "" "" "we rather accept an authoritarian government system, conformity and prejudices." ""</seg>
<seg id="360">A study shows: when comparing test messages, in which negative agreements were reported to Muslim countries, rather military attacks on Muslim countries, as well as circumcision of the rights of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just a academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you look when the mood against Muslims shot up -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terror attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the apron of Iraq and during two constituencies.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror, as I expected it.</seg>
<seg id="365">"" "" "" "it can actually be a tool to manipulate the public to undermine the foundation of a free society, which has reasonable and well informed citizens." ""</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We may feel it first, but the toxic air of anxiety leaves us all.</seg>

<seg id="372">His sister would tell me that he was the sweetest, most generous person, whom she knew.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her to her CV. she was stunned and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"when is such a young man a diversified young man?"</seg>
<seg id="375">Just a few weeks after visiting Suzanne at her brother and his wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, murdered her, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan, who had been visiting the afternoon, as with an execution, after he posted remarks against Muslims on his Facebook page.</seg>

<seg id="383">With our son in the children's seat we went silent, with high pressure to the mosque.</seg>

<seg id="407">What started as a platform for hobbyist is about to become a multi-billion business.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drones. it is made possible in research institutions around the world.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before air packet is entered into our social consciousness, autonomous fleet of flying machines in the FRAC Centre in France was built live in front of the audience a six-metre tower from 1 500 bricks. some years ago they started to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">Connecting terminals connect air devices high speed and acceleration on engaging space.</seg>
<seg id="411">They can also build self-resistant structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They learned to carry loads, deal with turmoil, and generally respond to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we want to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to exceed the limits of possible flights in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">With that a system works autonomous, it must know collectively, where in the room the mobile objects are located.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at ETH Zurich, we often use external cameras to find objects. that enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos, we use a new location technology of Verity Studios, a boom of our laboratories.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each flying machine has internal sensors to determine position in space, determine calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">External commands can be found at the highest layer of ebb. e.g. "Start" and "land."</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called tailstarter,</seg>
<seg id="422">A plane that tries to beat two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other Starrwingers, it is efficient approach, much more efficient than helicopter in all their variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">In contrast to most starrists it can float, and has great benefits at start and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always one side.</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of rear-starters is that they react sensitively to turbulence like wind gusts.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the flight device doesn't matter in which position the optimum position is regained and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research we often introduce basic abstract issues that penetrate the core of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">One such question would be: what is the smallest number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known as machines with thousands of moving parts that accumulate in order to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago, trained pilots couldn't fly remote-controlled aircraft that had only two moving parts: a propeller and a tailgate.</seg>
<seg id="435">Unrecently we discovered that flying with just one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the monosptic, the mechanically simplest flight device. it was invented recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only one moving part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No valves, hinges and transverse generation, no other actuators or control surfaces, only a propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanical simple, it happens very much in the interior life so that it can fly stable, and move over in space.</seg>
<seg id="440">Nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the tailgate. to get there flying, I have to throw it right.</seg>
<seg id="441">The likelihood, it's right to throw me all, is slight, that's why I show you a video that was filmed last night.</seg>
<seg id="442">If the monospic is an exercise in pleasures, this machine is here, the omnidirectional with its eight propellers, an exercise in excess.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this overflow?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that he is very symmetric.</seg>
<seg id="445">This is why he is ambivalent in his alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">Thereby he receives the auspicious ability,</seg>
<seg id="447">Moving in room to all directions, no matter what direction he is filming or even as it rotates.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">A lot is available in models, the rest is learned directly by flying.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's see that.</seg>
<seg id="451">When flying machines are to be part of our daily life, they must be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine consists of two separate two-propeller aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="453">This turns into clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against the clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When you build it, they behave like a high-performance Quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">However, if anything goes wrong -- a motor or propeller falls off, the electronics or a battery -- can the machine fly further if limited.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will demonstrate this now by making a half flightless.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration examined synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">The great number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a pallet of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We participated in standard micro-quadcopter -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip it with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Every unit knows where in the room it is and is self-controlled. therefore there is no limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully, you motivate these demonstrations to think new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe machine there is to be a flying lampshade on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us, the salary is in the development and the work act.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a reminder, how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that there are creative, smart braids allowed to shape them in such spectacular fashion.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential, is the bag on the ridge.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="469">1.3 billion years ago, two black holes circling in a very distant galaxy more quickly, they turned so the mass three probes in a tenth place in pure energy.</seg>
<seg id="470">This short moment, they lightened brighter than all stars in all galaxies of the whole of us known universe.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they have not freed their energy in the form of light.</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The whole energy was placed into space-time encoder and the universe exploded in Gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">We are defining these events at the beginning of time.</seg>
<seg id="476">1.3 billion years ago, a multi-cell life was created on Earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then the Earth has produced a lot of corals: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, people and -- God rise to us - even the internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">Around 25 years ago, a group of especially brave -- Rai Weiss decided to build a huge laser detector from the MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from Caltech -- to look for gravitational shafts, producing black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them held it for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized them as crazy geniuses so the US National Science Foundation finance their idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, design, design and extremely much hard work they built the detector Ligo: the Laser Interferometra Gravitational Field Observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the following period, the precision of Ligo could be considerably increased, which improved the recognition power.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore it's called Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">In early September 2015, Ligo was launched for a final test run by some smaller, persistent problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On 14 September 2015, only a few days after the start-up of the detectors, the Gravitational waves roared up black holes caused by the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the leave of my todill father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically, that was the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">All that which I had worked is not longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist on MIT. he studied gravitational waves from black holes and their by observatory such as Ligo measurable signals. but what are gravity waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a possibility in the structure of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">By passing the shaft, the space and its entire content are stretched in a direction, stretched out into the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">To illustrate instructors in courses for the theory of relativity often take a really alright dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretch and dust, stretch and dust."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravity waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On 14 September, for example, every one of us was stretched down and gestures. the elongation of an average human being was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">This means 20 zeros after the comma, followed by a 1. thus, the Ligo staff announced for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five-kilometre laser detector, and that's just absurd, this length should be measured on less than a thousandth radius of a nuclear explosion. this is grotesque.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classical text on Gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">Described Kip Thorne, a co-founder LIGOs, the hunt for the waves: "the technical difficulties in building such detectors are huge.</seg>
<seg id="503">But physicists are financially and with the support of the public certainly all obstacles are overcome. "</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott would like to say Ligo is more a ear as one eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than things around us: facial features, the size of your cell phone.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite practical, because so you can produce a picture or a map of things by making the light coming around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">It is different with tones.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">That is why it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot of things:</seg>
<seg id="512">To the face of your child.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead we listen to certain properties like sound and level, rhythm and volume to close the story behind.</seg>
<seg id="514">"now Alice is talking about."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob breaks it down."</seg>
<seg id="516">"dummer of Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We can offer no easy images of objects in space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by watching changes in amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for Ligo the measured frequencies are in the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">So when we convert wavepattern to sound, we can literally hear all of them literally.</seg>
<seg id="522">The gravitation I can tell us about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott has been busy.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, non-rotating holes, just circular: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">Turn off the two bodies very fast, you hear the same circus with an additional key change. that sounds like: wu-wu-wu-wu-wu!</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of motion kit, shaped into the shaft form.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I never forget -- heard Ligo the following: [Surrender of the sound] JOne knows what he has to hear, recognize this as the sound of -- SH:... two black holes, each 30 times as fast as the rods of your shaker.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let us consider what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the dichest body in space, one with a mass of 29 probes, the other with a mass of 36 probe, revolve around one hundred times a second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know it because we heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the permanent meaning of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo paves a completely new way to investigate the universe, as never before possible.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">We can see much in all -- practical or basically -- not.</seg>
<seg id="536">A supernova, for example. I would like to know why massereiche stars explode in super novae.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. we have learned a lot about the space of them.</seg>
<seg id="538">The exciting physical processes happen, however, in the core that lies behind thousands of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see through this opaak are.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitational waves penetrate iron, as if it would be transparent glass. I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it, because the urine is covered by its own afterglow.</seg>
<seg id="541">Using gravitational waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And the most important thing: I am optimistic that we have never seen in all things we have never seen, and of whom we have never seen. things we just discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact, Ligo found himself in the first attempt, which we did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says to this topic: ME: the type of stars that emphasizes black holes, like Ligo, are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient body from prehistoric times. the black holes are so to speak for our archaeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">Ligo enables us to make a completely different perspective on the events of all, to the emergence of stars and ultimately, as we emerged from this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge is now to be as brave as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to Ligo, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">"" "" "" "we need ideas for new Observatories -- a completely new generation of observatory on earth and in space." ""</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than to listen to the urine itself?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Do you dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago I tried a experiment.</seg>

<seg id="587">Four TV programmes, 70 hours television. three to four shows are at the same time in production.</seg>
<seg id="588">Every show offers hundreds of jobs that do not exist before.</seg>

<seg id="616">Do not understand me wrong, that does it.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the sums -- when I began to work and work with the TV production started to work and work, create, create and work together, I discovered this thing, this sums, this energy. the sums!</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">Sums is action and activity. the sums is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">Sums is music. the sums is light and air.</seg>

<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more I have to work.</seg>

<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am neurosurgery.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues I have done every day with human tragedies every day.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to the other, after a severe stroke or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgeon, it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other bodies, has a very low ability to self-healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a severe injury of central nervous system, patients often have a permanent, heavy disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is the reason why I was functional Neurosurgical.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional Neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor, who tries to improve the nerve functions through different surgical actions.</seg>
<seg id="804">"" "surely they have heard of one of the most well known," "" "Tiecerebellar stimulation" "". "in this way, one finds a electrode deep in the brain in order to influence the circuits of neurons so that the neurological function improves." ""</seg>
<seg id="805">It is really an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease which suffered severe trembling and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation, however, does not mean Neuro cure.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of working neurosurgeon is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion, we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I want to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">The brain can help itself with something help.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At that time I was executive and working day and night in the emergency.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I provided patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They have to imagine that at the brain-brain traumata stimulates the brain and the peeling pressure is rising.</seg>
<seg id="815">To save life, you have to reduce the skull transfer.</seg>
<seg id="816">Sometimes you need to remove a part of swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of throwing the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by this?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells out of this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is no easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">To make cells grow from a tissue, is comparable to very small children, which will be taken out of your family.</seg>
<seg id="822">You need to find the right diet, temperature, humidity, and the environments to flourish.</seg>
<seg id="823">Exactly that we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts, Jean-François succeeded.</seg>
<seg id="825">This he saw under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked like a stem cell culture. with large green cells, surrounded by small, unmature cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you still know of the biological classes that stem cells are unripe cells that can transform themselves into each cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niche of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface of the brain mass in the OP.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They divided up slowly and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">So we saw a new, strange cell population that looked like stem cells, but behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They originate from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make up 4% of our cerebral nerve cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the fetus stage, they ensure the brains of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they remain committed?</seg>
<seg id="845">We don't know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe they are taking part in the healing of the brain, since we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so sure.</seg>
<seg id="848">However, one thing is clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We stand before a potential cell source that enables brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to remove a piece of brain mass from the non-linguistic area and then to cultivate the cells exactly as it did Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="853">And then mark them in color to trace them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step, we planned them to the takeover of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplant -- autotrantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we are not given these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we are not given the same cells in your brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we could work with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario, we planned the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that after several weeks it was completely disappeared, they would go back home. the room is already busy, they will not be used there, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario, we added a violation and were given precisely the same cells, and now the cells remained -- they grew up to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could watch under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that were not planned.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence they show is these small points. these are the cells we are in vitro, in the culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">Of course we could not stop.</seg>
<seg id="864">Can these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained apes with a manual skill.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take food pellets of one tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made them very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they achieved a stable skill level, we last in the motorised cortex the motor-motorized area.</seg>
<seg id="869">Then the apes were paralysed, they could no longer move their hands.</seg>
<seg id="870">Exactly as it would happen to people, they recreate spontaneously up to a certain degree, exactly as after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">The patients are paralyzed and then they try to relax with the help of plastic brains. they relax at a certain degree, just like the monkey.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were sure the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left hand, they see the monkey strolling spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can yield about 40% to 50% of its original performance from injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so accurate and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Now see when we were given the cells perfectly: the same monkey, two months after maturity.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that were also very exciting for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since then, we have found a lot more about this cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them and use it later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use them in other neuropathological models, for instance at Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to imitate her in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I can show you soon as the human brain has the means to cure itself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="884">Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure now, several dozen people in the audience, perhaps even the majority, think: "I know someone who can't."</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely go.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question is what the biggest obstacles are, before you can start clinical trials in humans.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results, one has to complete about two kilograms of Papers and forms to pass these kinds of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yes, but it needs a long time, a lot of patience and a almost professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: take a look at the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it will take until somebody will come to hospital, and this therapy is available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First, it depends on the approval of clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will we allow the authority to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">This study has to be carried out with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to choose the patients to evaluate and evaluate the treatments, whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">You must apply this to a multicenter study.</seg>
<seg id="897">First, you have to really show that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that's sure, of course. JB: of course.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West making a big mistake, of course to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="903">"" "" "" "we don't see democracy as the fragile plant that is in reality but as inventory of our society." ""</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them as unchanging conditions.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe capitalism is inevitably leading to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">That is not right.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great imitators in Beijing have proved that it is quite possible to have a flourishing capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">In fact, democracy moves in us, in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">"" "" "" "the beginning of the year when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was inevitable that the democratic process of our country -- was inevitable that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- not allowed to influence the austerity programs that are realized in Greece."

<seg id="910">"" "" "" "at that moment, I thought it could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my sincere friends who would repeatedly have told me that democracy would change if it would change anything." ""</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point, I want to introduce you an economical model for a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">"" "" "" "I ask you, together with me to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup is a mistake, we could save ourselves democracy, but that we need a truly and defensive democracy." ""</seg>

<seg id="914">"" "" "" "to the subject of waste, I want to point out to an interesting contradiction that currently threatened our economies." ""</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the "twin-summit paradox."</seg>
<seg id="916">One summit is known to you. they know and recognize him as the debt mountain that casts its long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the debt mountain,</seg>
<seg id="918">But only a few recognize his Didymus.</seg>
<seg id="919">"" "" "" "a mountain of unused cash, which is to be anxious to invest there, however, to invest there where it would be productive and incomes with which you might produce debt berg and also all those things need to produce urgently, for example" "" "green" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">Over the past 3 months, the U.S., in England and in the eurozone have invested 3.4 trillion U.S. dollars, in all the prosperity of producing goods such as industrial plants, machinery, office building, schools, roads, tracks, equipment, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="922">3.4 Billions US dollar sounds like a lot of money until you spend the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely didn't do anything except the stock exchange and to rub the real estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">"" "" "" "so, debts and unproductive capital form the twin summit, which are not the same with the usual market mechanisms." ""</seg>
<seg id="924">The result is stagnating in wages, more than one quarter of the 25-54-year-old in the USA, Japan and Europe who would not invest a low demand that would not invest in which they would not invest in which they would not invest, that his son would kill him if he is growing.</seg>
<seg id="925">Unwilled the circumstances suggest that eatpus kills him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my Hagel with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"" "his extremely dissiderous art. all unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, developing human talents, and especially those technologies," "" "green" "" "technologies that are decisive for salvation of the earth." ""</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">I think so. but before we continue: what do we mean under democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the social form in which the free and the poor as a majority control the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian democracy, of course, got too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">However, it would be an error to reduce the significance of the athenian democracy due to these exclusion.</seg>
<seg id="934">"" "" "" "the decisive thing in the athenian democracy was and is that she gave them the working arms, but not only the right to free expression of expression, but more important and decisive that they agree on political determination with equal voting in question of the State belongings." ""</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy has not been held long.</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle, which is very bright, she is also burned out quickly.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, today, our liberal democracies don't have their roots in ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the Athenian democracy focused on the free citizens and strengthened the working arms, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which ultimately was a statute for rulers.</seg>
<seg id="940">The liberal democracy was only possible when a complete separation of politics and economy is possible, and the democratic process was confined to politics while the economy -- so the world of corporations -- a democracy-free zone became apparent.</seg>
<seg id="941">In today's democracies, since the time, when this separation of politics and the economy began, an inexorable struggle between the two, by the economy gradually undermigrated politics.</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you wonder why the politicians no longer like that?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not on a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">"" "" "" "it is because you can be in the government today and not in power, because the power of politics is andered into the economy and the areas are separated." ""</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my sharks with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is like a herd of prey that are so sustainably the animals of which they are nourished, decimated that they are starved at the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">"" "" "" "it is similar to the economy that has undermined politics as far as its self-induced economic crisis." "" "the power of corporations grows, its inequality is increasing, and the managing director of the corporations will be too anxious to invest the cash of their companies." ""</seg>
<seg id="948">"" "the succesful of capitalism distributes" "" "Demos" "" "from democracy, the higher the twin tops, and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of humanity." ""</seg>
<seg id="949">"" "if that is true, it is obvious that we must bring back politics and economy, and it would be better if the" "" "Demos" "" "control, as in ancient Athens, apart from exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners." ""</seg>
<seg id="950">By the way, this is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist Linke had this idea 100 years ago and it wasn't very good.</seg>
<seg id="952">The doctrine of the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor only regain a position as in ancient Athens, without creating new types of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: abolish the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low-beam workers by automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is, as long as business and politics are separate areas, the automation makes the twin summit higher, the waste of the twinkles, and the social conflicts deeper, as it is -- already very soon as I believe -- in countries like China will come.</seg>
<seg id="956">"" "so we have to reunite the economy and reunite the areas of economy and politics, and make sure we have the reunified area of" "" "matrix" "" "that lets the film" "" "matrix" "" "appear as a documentation." ""</seg>
<seg id="957">The question is, therefore, whether capitalism is the technical achievements that he has produced, will survive.</seg>
<seg id="958">"" "the most interesting question is whether capitalism is resembled through a cystopia, similar to those in" "" "Star Trek" "", "which is similar to humans and to keep their energy into the research of the universe, or into a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians, or into a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians," "" "Agora" "", "in long talks the meaning of life." ""</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it like to look like this "Star Trek" like utopia instead of "Matrix" -similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">In the practical implementation I would like to call you shortly, some examples.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the company's area: please introduce a capital market where you are working while working and in which your capital will follow you from a job to the next, and the company -- no matter where you are currently working -- is property of those who are currently working in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then, all incomes from capital and redeem and the concept of wage work is totally overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="964">No distinction between those who work the company, but they do not work therein, and employees that work there, but no exchange between capital and work, no major gaps between investment and spars, and ultimately no empirical twin summit.</seg>
<seg id="965">"" "in the field of global political economy," "" "Ask for a short-term exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, which will be issued from the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest emerging countries], in the interests of the entire mankind." ""</seg>
<seg id="966">"" "imagine that the entire world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it" "" "the cosmos," "" "in units of" "" "cosmos" "" "-- and each government is paying the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the trading surplus of the country to a joint fund." ""</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that this Fund is investing in "green" technologies, particularly in parts of the world where investment resources are rare.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes had proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that one was not the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">"" "" "" "today we have them, in particular before the backdrop of a unified policy and business." ""</seg>
<seg id="972">The world I describe is at the same time secretary, where she prefers privileged persons, and marxistic because they have buried the separation of capital and work in the trashcan of history, and keynesian, global keynesian.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all, it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">We will wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we sink into a "matrix" - similar diystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands, and we do it better democratic.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You are described in your biography yourself as libertarian Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if something about what I just said, then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">"" "" "" "the reason for reunification of politics and business is... do we do this, technological development will generate a massive decline in overall economic demand, what Larry summers referred to as" "" "long-term stagnation" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="984">"" "" "" "through the transfer of this crisis, from a part of the earth to the next, as we are experiencing it, it will not only destabilize our democracies, but also countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low." ""</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is true, Marx is quite relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">Likewise like Hayek, that's why I am a liberal Marxist, and how Keynes, and so I am completely wirl.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: actually, and now we are well too.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you are not wirl, you don't think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical statement -- YV: actually it was Einstein, who mentioned it. BG: in your lecture, you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday while dinner of the speakers you have said very clearly what you keep from the view of the West to China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a big degree of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies, we have the appearance of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my lecture, we have limited democracy on policy during the area where most of them plays, -- the realm of economy -- a completely democracy-free zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In some ways if I may say so provocative, China resembles that of the 19th century England.</seg>
<seg id="995">For -- do you remember -- we tend to connect liberalism to democracy - this is a mistake, historically.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, liberals, such as John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly sceptical about the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What one can watch now in China is similar to the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to second.</seg>
<seg id="999">China now decided to do what the West has done for itself in the 19th century, smells amazing to hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I'm sure many listeners are curious about their experience as finance ministers from the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I knew that this is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later on the first half of the year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from personal view, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece, but the eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">"" "" "" "namely, let us say goodbye to the complacency and didenying that a massive refinement line went through the eurozone, and continues to run sharply the development of the whole European Union." ""</seg>

<seg id="1008">"" "" "" "we have to do it right. unfortunately, the powers within the eurozone, continue to denying the denial." ""</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the Soviet Union experience --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If one tries to preserve a economic system that is not able to survive by political will and authorisism, it might have been able to catch a while, but if the change happens, it happens abruptly and destructive.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what change are you looking ahead?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future if we do not change its structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you have any mistakes in your time as finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back -- Ernsthaft...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a finance minister, or any minister, who claims in office after 6 months, especially in such a split-called situation, he claims not a mistake, then it is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake was to sign the debt recovery at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honourable interest in the bank of funds to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that was not.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They just wanted to fall our government, just because they didn't want to deal with the tests that were running through the eurozone.</seg>

<seg id="1038">Of Roy Price, most of them have never heard, though it is likely to be responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for a lot of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">That goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is an executive employee at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company of Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">He is 47 years old, slim, has an Igelfrisur and describes on Twitter as "Movies, TV, Technology, Tacos."</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for making shows and content, which will produce Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course this is a very hard-fought business.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are already so many TV series that Roy can't select any thing.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He has to find shows that are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he must find shows that are quite right on this bend.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the assessment distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the valuation goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this rating.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is rated at nine and higher, this is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">These are shows like "Breaking Bad," "Game of Thrones," "The Wire" -- all the shows that are addictive to make your brain asks, "Where are there any more of these episodes?"</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"" "on the left, here at this end, shows like" "" "Toddlers and Tiaras" -- -- "" "" -- that should tell you enough what goes at that end of the curve. "" "</seg>
<seg id="1055">"" "Roy Price does not worry about getting the left side of the curve, because I think you need special intelligence to offer" "" "Toddlers and Tiaras" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1056">He makes more thoughts about the mean failure, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they don't excite them.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must ensure that he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The print is available, and of course it's the first time that Amazon is doing something, that's why Roy Price does not risk anything.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs guaranteed success, so he won a contest.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He picks up many ideas for TV shows and choose eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and shows them online where they can watch everyone free of charge.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon does play for nothing, you get, right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers look at these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they don't know they are watched at watching this shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team who record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You can capture when you start the show when you pauses which parts you skips or check again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide with these data, which show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"" "in fact, they process the data, process these and draw the answer, and this reads:" "" "Amazon should make a Sitcom on four republican US senators." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1069">They did this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anyone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">Yes, "Alpha House," but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn't so good.</seg>
<seg id="1072">It's just an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7,4 is and Alpha house landet out at 7,5 -- so something over the average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked.</seg>
<seg id="1073">At the same time at another company another manager has placed a top-show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming of Netflix. just like Roy, he is always searching for this a super-show and he also uses data for it, but it does something different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of organizing a contest, he and his team saw the existing data on the Netflix viewer, so the reviews they show the shows, their course, which shows they like etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience: what shows they like what actors, which actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had together all the parts, they went a car and decided not to make a Sitcom about four senators but a drama series about a Senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards." Netflix has hit a hit, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9.1 valuation on this bend. so exactly where they wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course the question is: what happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">One has two very knowledgeable, data reversible firms.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data and it works super for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is that?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic suggests that it should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If one collects millions of data, for a decision which is required, then you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years of statistics as a back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">You are optimized it by very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The minimum thing you can expect is good television, or?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis did not work, then this is a bit scary because we are living in a time, in which we find more and more statistics about meeting serious decisions, far beyond the television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">Nobody. OK, that's even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one comes in touch with this software. come in touch with this software. come in touch with this software.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone is in jail here and is asking for release, it is likely that data analysis of this company is used to determine if a release is done or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of decide whether a show is good or bad, it is decided whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Mediocre TV, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many dates,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results are created. it's not that a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the data loss firms are also wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009, Google became known that they can predict data analysis outbreaks of flu, the trim way -- by data analysis of the Google research.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news. the success culminated in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked well, year around year, until it suddenly didn't work anymore,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And nobody could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It simply did not work, this was once again a sensation, including the publishing of the publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data have experienced firms such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">In spite of these errors, data will be reflected in the decisions of life -- at work, in law, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So, we should make sure that data are helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in the computerized genetics -- an area where some very clever people unimaginably many data to make serious decisions as the decision for cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years I have recognized some samples on the difference between successful decisions based on data and unsuccessful decisions. this pattern was to be extended.</seg>
<seg id="1110">If you have to solve a complex problem, do mainly two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">"" "" "" "first cut this issue into his individual parts, so you can analyse the individual parts; as a second, put the items together again to summarize a decision." ""</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and put together.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are just good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to cut a problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to put the parts back and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool, and we all have it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something which is good in which the brain is good, it is parts and pieces to summarize, even if the information is incomplete, in order to be a good decision -- especially when the brain is an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">That's why I think it was Netflix so successful because they used data and minds, where they also belong in the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">"" "they use data to better understand their audience because otherwise they would not have been able to put together all those parts, and make it a show as" House of Cards "" "," which does not stand in the data. "" "</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show, which meant that they entered a big personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon on the other hand did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">"" "they used data to control all their decisions first, first as they bet on TV ideas, then they chose" "" "Alpha Game" "" "as a show." ""</seg>
<seg id="1123">"" "it was a safe decision because they could always say:" "" "they tell us the data." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data is helpful for better decisions but I think things go wrong when data start to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data is just a tool, and in order not to forget, this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"" "it is also called" "" "Magic 8 Ball" "". "it's amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or No-Question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer." "" "most likely" "" "-- right here at this moment." ""</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will later violate it with a technical demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">I've met some decisions in my life so far, where I should have listened to the ball.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you can, of course, if you have the data available, you would like to replace them by something much more sophisticated, such as data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change basic construction.</seg>
<seg id="1135">Maybe the ball will clave and wiser and clamers. in the end, it's easy to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I think this is very encouraging, that in spite of the great amount of data still pays out decisions, make decisions to be an expert in which you are doing, and risks to enter.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Because at the end, it is not the data, but the risks involved with which you land at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you very much.</seg>
