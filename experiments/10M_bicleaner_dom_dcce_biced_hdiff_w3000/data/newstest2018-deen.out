München 1856 : four maps which change your ga@@ ze to the city
a Ir@@ ren @-@ An@@ st@@ alt , where young people will meet today .
a greeting card , where it is now dug for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
small gar@@ dener affects the former reason of farmers .
the oldest official card of Munich supports exciting stories about days .
it &apos;s annoying when maps are not current .
everyone knows who had to arrive at times , because the car @-@ Nav@@ i was showing a green meadow instead of a b@@ ypass road .
historical maps of the digital Bavaria @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of ge@@ op@@ ort@@ als Bayern of the State Government , are anything but current - yet very illumin@@ ating .
especially when you compare it to current online maps .
then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed in the spread @-@ area of Munich &apos;s Merk@@ ur since the 19th century .
the digital Bayern @-@ Atlas is a Flick@@ ent@@ ep@@ p@@ ich , one of which is not the same as such .
in the great coverage map , for cities and mun@@ icipalities , more detailed maps were incorporated , called Ur@@ positi@@ onal pet@@ als .
this created according to the Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk &apos;s Wal@@ vis between 18@@ 10 and 1864 and jump to the first survey of Bay@@ erns .
your client : Napoleon .
in the spring of 1800 the French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon wished for an overview of the occupied country , giving a top@@ ographic survey of Bavaria in order - of course for military purposes .
even though the French troops entered the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville from February 9 , 1801 there were the neighbors who created the idea of a nationwide Bavaria @-@ map .
Kur@@ für@@ st Max IV Joseph pushed forward the project , founded the &quot; Top@@ ograph@@ ical Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bay@@ erische Ver@@ mess@@ aging Investig@@ ation .
the Ur@@ positi@@ onal leaf for Munich comes from the year 1856 and is like all the others on the website of the Bavarian State Library .
the comparison morning / Today is the most impressive example of its capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
one example is sub@@ send@@ ling , which is still relatively isolated in the map of 1856 .
S@@ end@@ ling was born 21 years after the development of the map , so 1877 , the Munich district of Munich .
today it lies in the middle of the city .
the houses of sub@@ mits will focus on today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße which was named after George Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ ans@@ er in 1878 , leader of the Bavarian farmer &apos;s uprising against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where the West@@ park is , you can see nothing but fields - at first glance : in writing a small @-@ piece map with dozens of numbers and numbers : hand@@ written numbered pieces from the so @-@ called &quot; Ur@@ um@@ ption &quot; which was derived from the basic tax .
&quot; &quot; &quot; little par@@ c@@ els apply there today no more farmers - but the small gar@@ dener of the plant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land in Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ send@@ ling .
the Ther@@ es@@ ien@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 , was still a meadow , and no concrete desert in the 19th century .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the Ur@@ positi@@ onal sign , one reads only the street names &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the beach &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or by the hill &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; On sk@@ ies &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ren An@@ st@@ alt &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ fel@@ d@@ straße you once locked people with del@@ u@@ sions .
there was 1858 / 59 built in the Munich district @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; On the Au@@ er Lü@@ nen . &quot;
in 1872 Dr. Bernhard von G@@ ud@@ der conducted the institution - that psychiat@@ rist who was brought to King Ludwig II &apos;s death in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was advanced for his time and ended for example the chains of the so @-@ called Ir@@ ren . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , he is forbidden to use violence against the passengers , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Museum Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who has engaged for an exhibition with the An@@ st@@ alt .
for 280 patients initially had space , and was added to 500 places later .
eventually this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the circul@@ atory plant in hair 1905 .
since 2006 , the Is@@ ar @-@ A@@ MP@@ ER @-@ Klin@@ ikum Munich @-@ Ost is one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ rist@@ s .
in the area of former Au@@ er An@@ st@@ alt , young people in the Munich Sal@@ es@@ ian@@ um are facing .
the Order acquired the 1920 building complex and walked in a youth hostel with training .
West is located west of the TS@@ V Munich East , east of residential houses from the 1980s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , the children @-@ house &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; erected in architectural style on the origins of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt , which was destroyed during WW@@ II during bombing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz in 1856 was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; main square &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the shopping route called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
the Allied bom@@ b@@ ings broke many holes in the city center in December 1944 .
one big stayed until today - at the Mari@@ en@@ hof .
the English Institute , small business houses and a tomb stone from the Middle Ages had been on the Mari@@ en@@ hof , where these days were to work and on 5 April 2017 the ground@@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn route .
compare the old Munich @-@ Map with the slide @-@ picture of today - and fill the hole on the Mari@@ en@@ hof .
civil rights published travel war@@ nings for Mis@@ souri
the National Association for the promotion of Far@@ mers has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Mis@@ souri because of the discrimin@@ atory policy and the rac@@ ist attacks of the state .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the state of Mis@@ souri , which will come into force until 28 August 2017 , ur@@ ges af@@ ro @-@ American trav@@ ellers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans , as a number of question@@ able , r@@ ass@@ en@@ based occur@@ ren@@ ces will occur in the entire state and here , &quot; says it in the opinion of the group .
a recent law of Mis@@ souri , which causes people to become a discrimination against discrimination , and the prosec@@ utions of the state , which inten@@ sely aim un@@ disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ately to min@@ orities , promp@@ ted the group to publish the travel warning , NA@@ AC@@ P said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have injuries of the civil rights that happen to people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are stopped and killed because of their skin colour , &quot; said the President of Mis@@ souri NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , Kansas City Star .
&quot; we hear complaints in such frequency , which we haven &apos;t heard yet . &quot;
it is the first such warning that the organization issued for a state in the USA .
the group cited inci@@ dents like rac@@ ist violation of black students at the University of Mis@@ souri and death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee .
S@@ anders died in un@@ question@@ able circumstances from the beginning of the year , after he had no more fuel while traveling through the state and was arrested by the police of Mis@@ souri in custody without a crime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council also refers to a recent report by the Bureau of Mis@@ souri , in which black drivers in the state will be 75 percent more common than wh@@ ites . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware of their families , friends and employees , what could happen in Mis@@ souri , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people need to be ready to bring it , or let the relatives know that they are travelling through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mis@@ souri posted 100 har@@ ass@@ ment in 2015 , following the latest figures from the H@@ ass@@ aul@@ ting report of the FBI , imposed by the state in regard to the number of such injuries in the 16th place of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the travel warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ souri law , which would make it harder to su@@ e a company because of home or employment discrimination . &quot; &quot; &quot;
previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued a travel war@@ nings for Texas and Arizona , committed to commit local law en@@ forcement authorities to commit people because of immigration violations , which will contribute to further breeding pro@@ filing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; travel war@@ nings are usually issued by foreign affairs for other countries , but l@@ ately , st@@ ak@@ eholders have used to measure the measure of certain laws and trends within the USA . &quot; &quot; &quot;
electric fence project is elementary
the Fisch@@ erb@@ acher Wei@@ dez@@ v@@ aun project is a successful project and will continue next year .
the CDU members of the CDU and K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac have provided a picture in front of the site .
at the right of the family of Schwen@@ demann , representatives of the farmers &quot; CDU &quot; together met with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two de@@ pu@@ ties .
Markus Schwen@@ demann gave first insights into his farm in which he farms 55 hectares of meadows and 40 acres of forest , 40 dairy cows and as well as many k@@ ittens were supplied in five apartments .
the &quot; Schwar@@ zw@@ al@@ d@@ milk &quot; is for him the alternative market @-@ market @-@ market for milk of its cows , so Schwen@@ demann .
only Region@@ als comes to the table of the holiday .
since he is also BL@@ HV @-@ Chairman of Fisch@@ erb@@ ach , he referred to the &apos; fence project as &quot; elementary importance . &quot;
I can not profitable on such steep areas .
the green area care for a lot of work , much more can be processed with the motor sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have been strug@@ gling here with the terms and top@@ ography conditions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed Schwen@@ demann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 , he took over the el@@ ter@@ nal operation and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer , even if he does not perform organic operations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the commune recognized the importance of the electric fence and is pleased with the leader &apos;s promotion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare , farmers would have to support farmers .
I hope that the aff@@ o@@ rest@@ ation of surfaces could be gone out for quite a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest treasure we have , are people who work in agriculture and make thoughts about how they continue their farm , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed the Mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmers are often in criticism for the promotion
a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in the year 2013 .
the annual conservation area is 40 hectares , which are not permitted until at least 20@@ 23 .
half of the total cost of 71 500 euros was promoted by leader , a quarter contributed by the commune of Fisch@@ erb@@ ach .
consequently , the farmers remained 12 million euros , which they had to invest in 16,@@ 2 kilometers of electric fence .
&quot; the big advantage is the lon@@ gevity of the f@@ ences , &quot; explained Schwen@@ demann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac emphas@@ ized : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are doing a really good job , without farmers and women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also for Peter White it was : &quot; the best food is produced here . &quot;
the State Court ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg provides the state support of women &apos;s fence .
the objective is to open the Black Forest .
pr@@ er@@ equ@@ is@@ ite is the presence of one by the L@@ PR designated funding .
moreover , the fenced area should not be rather economical ( slopes at 35 per cent ) and must be threatened by aff@@ o@@ rest@@ ation .
at present the application of eight participants with 24 par@@ c@@ els , which would like to build a 16 kilometer fence at the age of eight participants .
the annual conservation area represents 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 Euros .
is nothing sacred ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump is taking up the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is to attack the statues .
the Americans love these as well as any other - therefore the carefully staged fall of Saddam Hussein on the Fir@@ dos Square in Bagh@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump @-@ regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a hit@@ ch@@ oral dispute with Jim A@@ cost@@ a of CNN about the proposals of the President of the Republic of Liberty with the Statue of Liberty .
to remain fair , Miller did not handle the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of bo@@ at@@ ters and Liberty I@@ mit@@ ers would have landed him if he had done it .
but he took their importance , and in particular the importance that it was attributed to as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the Monument , added to its base .
when Miller A@@ cost@@ a declared : &quot; I don &apos;t want to go down to a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom , which en@@ light@@ ens the world .
the poem I refer to which was added later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
Miller is proper proper , but how he form@@ ulated it , isn &apos;t really about history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is about the contemp@@ tible words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state invites not only any old immigrants , but the trouble of the poor : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your trou@@ bles , your poor , and your op@@ pressed masses , who cra@@ ve to breathe freely , the el@@ eventh waste of your rich co@@ asts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a time in which the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; el@@ ap@@ ing waste &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was better to see on our screens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller did not engage in literary critic - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Tr@@ um@@ ps USA .
this conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural conflict : it is actually a conflict about the meaning of America .
Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words after their death on the basis - knew very well that they had completed a highly political action .
the sculpture should show links between French and American rep@@ ublic@@ an@@ ism by showing in an un@@ used classical picture depic@@ tion of the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem , the female figure no more abstract - she has received a voice .
and there is a completely different name : mother of ex@@ il@@ ant .
the connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist coup d and a devast@@ ating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just like Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , people wanted to change from right wing this long .
the big scre@@ am Rush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a type of John the Baptist for coming back of tr@@ ump , argu@@ ed 2010 that the Statue of Liberty did not invite anyone , but rather an early ne@@ oc@@ con@@ doms , that bring the American flame to the re@@ plen@@ ished world : &quot; Lady Liberty is going forward .
it should bear the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States in the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch should not shine through the way into the United States . &quot;
Lim@@ bau@@ gh is somewhat unusual here .
the importance of the statue is quite and even a question of the point of perception .
the great fan@@ ciful act of Lazarus was to see them as they saw from the exhau@@ st@@ ive , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible journeys to the deck of ships .
it is in the tru@@ est sense to see the world from a perspective of people who seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
their statue spoke to them the words of hope and the welcome which they must hear .
and of course , this is not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump would ever wish to recognise .
their tor@@ ch should not shine through the way , but hatred , who is the only source of power to infl@@ ame .
World@@ cup 2017 : Neil Black pra@@ ises Scottish members of the United Kingdom
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle rec@@ alls a time when only two vill@@ i belonged to the team of Great Britain
&quot; &quot; &quot; the principal director of the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom , Neil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent of the world championship &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes has been selected for London 2017 on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; something special is developed in Scotland &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom itself have to learn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it , and we are trying to understand it , and we will continue until we find out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I speak with people in the Scottish Institute of Sports and think that it has something to do with what they have done . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British Athletics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the guy at the corner corner .
whatever the circumstances of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are medals @-@ candidates , among them Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart , which will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m route , while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was chosen from the team as a team captain .
&quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is quite modest .
her captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; says Black .
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish , or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and were very proud and were very motiv@@ ating .
the passion and genuine feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h brought quite naturally , were great . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Common@@ wealth of silver medal that will compete with their fifth world championships at the 400 m barrier , says it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incredible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is that 16 sh@@ all@@ ots are in the British squ@@ ad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes around the World Championship was seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 .
the mid @-@ h@@ aul runner Mu@@ ir leads on this path and has raised five British and two European records last year .
you will participate in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m races .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , the 1,500 m runs , is another Scot@@ sman who was to watch the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games .
Do@@ yle rec@@ alls his first world championships , when the only other Scot@@ sman was in the team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ nell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; economic capitalist &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says that they are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enorm@@ ously proud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that many of their fellow country@@ men do not only belong to the team , but in some cases will also be among the medals and in the fin@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is so special about the team capit@@ als that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so it was a great honor to know that my team @-@ mates for me have voted and voted for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added to something special for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; obviously , I am very proud of all the vill@@ i who belong to the team .
it just shows how far we have come .
and they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to climb on Po@@ dia .
what concerns my speech as capit@@ als ?
yes , I think she went well .
I have pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
so it &apos;s really important to sit on this home support and benefit from that we are back in the Olympiastadion .
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it simply will be a great atmosphere there . &quot;
blocking crit@@ ters on Facebook : do not work for a public post if you cannot bear the fuel of voters .
the father of our country knew something of bad news .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it didn &apos;t take long until the newspapers struck him because of all , from the interior policy up to its political principles .
he was kno@@ cked up in the cr@@ iti@@ que of the cr@@ iti@@ que .
but he did not put his critics to silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because in 17@@ 83 , Washington said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the freedom of speech can be taken away - and , dum@@ b and dum@@ b we are led like sheep . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this brings me to Maryland Larry H@@ ogan , who must work to be more like Washington .
H@@ og@@ ans staff have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union den@@ ounced him at the beginning of this week .
the governor of the governor dismissed the complaint as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online comment was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; Na , &quot; and ? &quot;
&quot; it is only Facebook , &quot; said many people .
but it is important .
and it &apos;s especially important when it is a type like H@@ ogan .
this is a rep@@ ubli@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazing .
he has the second highest acceptance of the 50 govern@@ ors in the nation .
H@@ ogan is no re@@ ac@@ tionary heat head .
he has shown a fixed hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to principles .
he was also very sent to use Facebook as a primary means to associate himself with his voters and moving his hair@@ less head to chemotherapy on his side .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the block of persons coming to the side of the Governor - which is a public forum , is considered officially and of employees who are paid by public tax @-@ Dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in an interview with The Washington Post , H@@ og@@ ans Spre@@ cher@@ in Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse gained the actions of the governor and argu@@ ed that the block@@ age of the comments was nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it is too easy to use the image of trol@@ ls or sp@@ as@@ ers , which vibr@@ ate online the wh@@ ip .
the post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by H@@ ogan .
and these are only real people who speak with their leaders , a teacher , a business@@ man and a pastor , no trol@@ ls .
they all said they were respec@@ tful , thou@@ ght@@ ful , and not prof@@ ane .
the pastor cited the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to H@@ og@@ an &apos;s Catholic faith .
lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , MD , was not crowded but she asked for h@@ ass@@ ine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am polite that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current messages , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote in the comment section of the news broadcast &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t really appreciate this idea when a number of people on the same theme will take place , then they are regarded as so @-@ called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what the employees of the Govern@@ ors called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated spam attack &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would probably call others &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inter@@ c@@ ession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to watch a message by blocking a critic or delete a negative comment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is much cleaner than in early days when you have done the same thing that employees were disp@@ at@@ ched to collect and burn newspapers with critical lad@@ ders and to avoid demonstr@@ ators or to silence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but just this happens digital .
H@@ ogan isn &apos;t the first public officials to critic@@ ised that he has implic@@ ated Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is accused of Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first milest@@ ones in this question was in Virginia last week .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors des Lou@@ dou@@ n County last the First Am@@ end@@ ment , according to the U.S. District judge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when they re@@ union a v@@ oter from their Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Governor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) received a visit to AC@@ L@@ U because of its use of Facebook and Twitter .
it should not be so hard .
at the time of Washington &apos;s time , the time of affordable Por@@ tos had a similar effect on the Internet .
the number of newspapers multiply between 17@@ 76 and 1800 ; and anonymous post@@ p@@ ens hit the lead .
and even then Washington had anonymous trol@@ ls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people who used pseud@@ ony@@ ms such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Por@@ ti@@ us , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; wrote all the letters of newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pet@@ iti@@ oning , which critic@@ ized its position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , trade and shipping with Britain , overwhel@@ med his office , according to historical documents , collected by the Online Pap@@ ers of George Washington Project .
but he did not put it into silence .
freedom of speech , dis@@ agreements and dis@@ courses are the basis of our nation .
and true leadership means to accept that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort at the Renaissance Club
the former Europeans no . 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for home comfort in the next three days , since the Renaissance Club in East Lot@@ hi@@ an hosted the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who passed the last year in the Ar@@ cher@@ field links to the final round , before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , is connected to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the association and CE@@ Os Jerry Sar@@ v@@ adi .
&quot; I saw how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how he reaches his glory with this event , &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty .
&quot; the players will see this course from his best page , it is in a great condition .
Jerry has made a great job when he k@@ icking this place .
he is a ze@@ al@@ ous advoc@@ ate of this game and is proud of his performance .
this is a great show@@ case for this course . &quot;
Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defend a championship , although he won the European Tour in his 32 @-@ year career as well as at the European Challenge tour .
&quot; that really feels special , &quot; said the player , native to South@@ port .
&quot; I cannot defend the Extrem@@ ad@@ ura Open since it was in the year after I had won them from the program .
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it &apos;s a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories from last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon , to win last year here .
it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate . &quot;
Gary Or@@ r , who returned to the European Senior Tour last year , returns to the European Senior Tour last year .
this event will be his first Scottish appearance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more if you play at home , &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh .
&quot; you want to do it well , but you feel that additional pressure .

less pul@@ mon@@ ary cancer through pas@@ siv@@ ity
less people have died in lung cancer for the past two decades .
scientists from the Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf University Hospital ( UK@@ E ) come into a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates , 167 pul@@ mon@@ ary cancer is attri@@ but@@ able to passive smoking a year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said student leader Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when compar@@ ing a study on this subject , he moved from 1994 to this subject .
at that time , there have been 400 pul@@ mon@@ ary cancer cases because of pas@@ siv@@ ity per year in Germany .
the new study is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
domestic connections are proved to be very complex
the construction work in the Vill@@ inger Street are in full swing and lies in time , &quot; says Fred Hein@@ ze .
in the area of domestic connections , the location is more complicated than susp@@ ects , as in the underground that is not noted in the plans .
the traffic , which is still ob@@ struc@@ ted the construction work , represents a big problem for the construction of the company St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ignor@@ ance of drivers before red lights and shut@@ ters is already enormous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road is closed and only the bus buses are entitled to pass through .
Angelo Car@@ uso , Marvin Kost@@ or@@ z and Tim Kost@@ or@@ z from the St@@ ump@@ p company have been working with working on the bridge for weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days were pretty hard . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but fortunately we were supplied by our friend Fritz Matt with cool mineral water , &quot; explains Marvin Kost@@ or@@ z .
poverty and death in the Indonesian Gold@@ land
when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks the dinner , they don &apos;t use stove .
it even rarely uses a pot .
in their wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai government in Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife usually den@@ otes a sweet potato - locally as &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly into the chim@@ ney .
after half an hour the stolen bu@@ cks is taken from e@@ ager , un@@ washed hands and swallowed .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture , where she also lets her daily work , e.g. clothes with cloudy water from the nearby sw@@ amp .
a bucket in a homeless space serves as a lat@@ rine .
the youngest of the four wives of her husband were not assigned to their fields .
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
of course , it can be dangerous to work : most vill@@ agers are unemployed , and many are drinking too , and there are the soldiers here .
&quot; nobody dar@@ es to run after 17 o &apos;clock in the village , &quot; she says .
it is a rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , who was taken in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1.0@@ 26 elders were to vote in front of the occup@@ ying troops .
an existing movement which touched for independence against the Dutch rule , turned quickly against the government of Jak@@ arta , who maintains control over the region and exclu@@ de foreign journalists or legal ob@@ servers .
in 2003 , the Province was officially distributed in Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , where the independent part of Pap@@ ua New Guinea comprised the eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as close as it is desert . the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from provincial capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the car rental .
there is no public transportation .
the city with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants is composed of wooden houses , surrounded by bam@@ boo sho@@ ots , and from corrugated roofs that were converted through rust in various gel@@ b@@ brown sounds .
only very few Indones@@ ians have made their journey here , wei@@ rd because journalists and practically no foreigners .
before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans an God called U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were also other changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were not used to bear this clothing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and pointed to her vivid , hand@@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirts and her bright rock . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; earlier we had only leaves on our bodies . &quot;
Pap@@ ua is Indonesia &apos;s p@@ oo@@ rest province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and some of the worst child mortality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s Gold@@ land .
the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gr@@ ass@@ berg , owned by Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high @-@ country province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort was valued at 3.1 billion US dollars of gold and copper .
in addition , Pap@@ ua has a value of wood resources valued at estimated 78 billion US dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , these riches are a source of mis@@ ery for the Pap@@ ua , ensuring that Indonesian military has preserved a high @-@ quality presence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an investigation from 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort paid local military and units between 1998 and 2004 , nearly 20 million US dollars , including a single officer .
Pap@@ u@@ lian claims after greater autonomy threat@@ ens these golden go@@ ose and will be treated mer@@ cil@@ ess .
according to activists , more than 500.000 Pap@@ ua have been killed and thousands were ra@@ ped , tor@@ tured and imprisoned since 1969 .
these massac@@ res in Pap@@ u@@ as tri@@ bal leaders in the 1970 @-@ s were treated according to the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission for genocide .
in the region alone the Indonesian police arrested more than 3.@@ 900 peaceful protest@@ ers last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will all interpret &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a report of the Erz@@ di@@ oc@@ ese Brisbane from 2016 , in which reports about atro@@ cities and torture - rape and electric env@@ elop@@ es are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal defeat of peaceful demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims since every week happen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia @-@ researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bolts are reinforced , since pap@@ u@@ as resources bring a flow of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demo@@ graphic development changes the popul@@ ous industrial construction of the popul@@ ous islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sumatra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .

&quot; migrants started to sell chickens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local Pap@@ ua , &quot; explains A@@ be@@ th You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ Local , who moved to the province of Jay@@ ap@@ ura to work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has the native Pap@@ ua - the mom @-@ Mama &#91; the women &#93; of Pap@@ ua - cost their market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Indonesian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , known in the Volk@@ sm@@ und as Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised to im@@ balance the ine@@ qualities and the infr@@ in@@ gement of the Pap@@ ua during his election campaign in 2014 .
former Zimmermann secured 27 of the 29 districts of Pap@@ ua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Pap@@ ua too little has changed , and today the locals feel betra@@ yed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our hearts are broken because we voted for Jok@@ ov@@ i in 2014 , with expect@@ ation that he will perform our hopes that justice becomes restored , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says You . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered only two months after Jok@@ ov@@ is &apos;s inauguration in October .
on 7 December 2014 , a group of 11 children accompanied and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness .
the fri@@ ghtened children told them that they should turn off their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers participated in their sound and later returned to four soldiers , the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had drunk , pursued and struck the group with their rif@@ les , said sacrifices and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
one child , 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so hard hit that he fell into the coma .
a few hours later the building of the nearby governmental commission was set fire and things escal@@ ated on the next day .
about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua women , women and children gathered at a football pitch in front of the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice .
they carried nit@@ rous sa@@ ws and led the orph@@ ita dance - in the circle regularly and a bird wat@@ ering - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ tribe .
some demonstr@@ ators started to tow stones to police and military posts .
when the atmosphere was heated , the soldier was sent a command over an internal radio : &quot; if the masses do more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; says the TIM@@ E &apos;s official document , which has not been released by local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threat@@ ening danger and called for rest and called for the crowd to return home .
nobody was listening in the mood .
&quot; when I turned around , I suddenly shot in my left wr@@ ist , &quot; he said TIM@@ E on the porch of his colourful wood@@ land .
kay@@ ak still doesn &apos;t know who fired , but tells you that the ball out of the ranks were gathered here .
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds .
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was taken three times , so his c@@ ousin , the witness of the shooting was .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ran to him and under@@ took his body for sure that he was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es , who only bears a name like many Indones@@ ians , the TIM@@ E in a dark mood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I saw that he was dead ... I kissed him . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the leaders of the Pap@@ ua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , said that his officers only wanted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; secure their station &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because they are attacked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to defend ourselves when people threatened to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Pap@@ ua Police , Commissioner Pud@@ jo Su@@ list@@ i@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others injured .
the news about the killing came only on the following day &apos; filtered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
three weeks Jok@@ ow@@ i held a passionate talk in Jay@@ ap@@ ura where he utter@@ ed sympath@@ ies for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to the historical abuse of Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case to be solved immediately , so it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; security minister Wir@@ anto said in October 2016 , that he establish an extra@@ judicial mechanism for con@@ dol@@ ences of historical human rights violations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; most injuries occurred long ago .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we have committed to walk these violations , but there are processes that have to run through . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he made a retreat when he spoke to the TIM@@ E on 5 June in Jak@@ arta , and said he has no plans to establish a complaint mechanism in Pap@@ ua .
instead , everything is legally regulated , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; confusion leading to the UN due to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; demanded more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody independence vote of 1999 said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Pap@@ ua have already been resolved , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot; &quot; &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims received such claims with gri@@ mm@@ ous unbelie@@ vers .
&quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times in the last three years but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es .
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says he still lives in fear for years .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am afraid to be arrested by the military , I fear to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident .
he says that he was defeated by the military , after he helped him to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I had buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military sought me , &quot; he says .
the shooting plants have not stopped .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police fired on vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai .
while confron@@ tation between vill@@ agers and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma , refused to bring a conscious man to the hospital , a person and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , the 24 year old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was drow@@ ned when he fishing in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital .
dwelling vill@@ agers protest@@ ed in front of the company &apos;s s@@ iting company .
the police said that the vill@@ agers threw stones on officers , which re@@ acted by fir@@ ing warning .
but locals say that the mobile Brigade ( Indonesian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began shooting down the crowd and killed one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u B@@ adi@@ i who lives near the hospital and witness how the injured one has been delivered quickly , so the TIM@@ E . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I hid myself two days in my house . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai Parliament has called to draw the participating officers to account and withdraw the police raid on the territory . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always an un@@ ru@@ sting stove for the Indonesian government .
lack of practical development strength@@ ens the dis@@ satisfaction of the regular members of Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dani and Dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many joined the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Free Pap@@ ua movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army that claims to defend the rights of the Pap@@ ua by using spor@@ adic attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of Indonesian soldiers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the top O@@ PM leaders are from Pan@@ i@@ ai , among them T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das Kog@@ o@@ ya .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in response to this , thousands of people were arrested in Pan@@ i@@ ai in recent years and arbit@@ rar@@ ily taken into custody under the pre@@ text of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; securing national sovereignty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some people never appear again .
among the people in Pap@@ ua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty strength@@ ens the dis@@ satisfaction .
the little bit of rice , sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , is too expensive for locals .
bread is just beyond reach .
people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can process four or five fields of sweet potato .
they retain the bulk of the harvest for the family , while the rest is sold to the local market .
ten pieces Not@@ a tast@@ ed only 10,000 Indonesian Rup@@ iah ( 75 C@@ ents ) .
over time , economic ine@@ qualities have grown between the native pap@@ ua and the new migrants that have since the opening of new flight connections to Nab@@ ire airport in larger numbers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the few jobs that are in the region are usually about the better educated and prosper@@ ous migrants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pap@@ ua rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to lead their own company competitive .
&quot; the young people are not interested to stay in the village ... for there is no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , the chair@@ person of Pan@@ i@@ ai .
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
in addition , the coverage of international media remain ten@@ se .
by the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ das and Bas@@ ille Long@@ ch@@ amp were deported because of a lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although the rare permission was given to films .
according to P@@ hel@@ in K@@ ine , the deputy chief of Asia @-@ director of Human Rights Watch , promises to raise the promises of coverage to promote transparency and development , not realized .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists who try to report from Indonesia &apos;s un@@ troubled provinces of Pap@@ ua and West@@ pap@@ ua : visa ref@@ usal and a black list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lack of press control means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely restricted to the Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s immediate neighbours .
in March , six Pacific states - Ton@@ ga , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Mar@@ sh@@ all@@ Islands and the Salom@@ onian Islands - the UN Human Rights Council , the &quot; various and widespread violations &quot; in Pap@@ ua including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting .
the same countries have historically been supporting O@@ PM .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the spokes@@ man for the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Ministry of Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha Nas@@ ir pointed out the alle@@ g@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Indonesia , there is still a democratic system , and there is free media , so it is difficult to dis@@ gu@@ ise the evidence of human rights cases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
people on site want more foreign governments to acknowledge this .
as an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the direction of human right @-@ ambassador Ke@@ es Van B@@ aar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura visited their silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that was also participated in the session but remain anonymous .
Indonesia won another presidential election in 2019 , but the Pap@@ ua will probably not be able to vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jok@@ ov@@ i is a man who has good inten@@ tions , but he is surrounded by people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Gob@@ ai , Chairman of the St@@ em Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he wants to know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people are living under the constant threat of a rob@@ ber@@ ian military , in a poor up@@ lift and health service .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gob@@ ai said that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other pap@@ ua , consider her voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gu@@ ilt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that he must return . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they only want justice , &quot; he says .
despite the threats and in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ sacrific@@ ed offer a final symbolic act of the Des@@ p@@ ite : the bodies of a victim was buried on a complex opposite the police and the military station .
they know they may never return to justice , but at least they don &apos;t forget their crimes .
&quot; a member of our family has been killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us .
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai to the second time
a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest living towers of the world in Dubai to its audi@@ ob@@ ook and forced hundreds of inhabitants to flee from 3@@ 37 metres high , 79 @-@ storey buildings .
it is the second fire that goes through the high @-@ rise in just two years , that is acci@@ dentally called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) .
the building was evacu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word on the cause of the flame .
&quot; we slept and we got up at the fire alarm and the scre@@ aming of the people .
we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to come from the 50th floor to the bottom , &quot; a resident , who att@@ ends his name as George ang@@ ab , Reuters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dub@@ ais &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dub@@ ais &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said that units of fire fighting against 4.@@ 00 local time ( 00@@ .00 GMT ) , the fire cleared and the building cooled down . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the government said they work on the provision of accommodations for the people concerned .
the incident can ask questions about safety of materials that are used in outer areas of high @-@ rise buildings around the world .
a study by the management of the Tor@@ ch building following the fire in 2015 revealed that the largest part of the damages ar@@ ising from the cl@@ adding , outside facing for decoration or isolation , came .
in the UK , the police said they believe that the system of plates for insulation and cl@@ adding to the London Gren@@ ade Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in June , where about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup reform : further Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International Tennis Association ( IT@@ F ) has fallen through its big Davis Cup @-@ Cou@@ p at the General Assembly .
at the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City , the two @-@ thirds majority of the two @-@ third majority are supported for this sport revolutionary suggestion , which was not supported by the two @-@ third majority .
although often very long , this is why a very estimated five @-@ sentence classic stay in the traditional rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 6@@ 3.9 percent of the member states voted for reform , the goal of the IT@@ F president David Hag@@ ger@@ ty , therefore only scar@@ c@@ ely missed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members did not accept the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of this iconic and historic con@@ tests , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will continue to work to improve the application .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not until the vote was , after many claims had already had the proposal to apply the final on a neutral place . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new from 2018 will be compar@@ atively smaller details : the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will soon have the right to host the host law in the first round .
in order to reduce the costs of the organis@@ ers , the requirements in training places etc. are facil@@ itated and the players will have to complete fewer official media dates before the Davis Cup .
more than 1 of 5 U.S. travelers offer prohibited objects in the plane , finding out a survey
a pol@@ l of air@@ pass@@ ers revealed that more than 20 % deliber@@ ately notified or un@@ consci@@ ously banned items by the US Transportation Security Administration &apos;s control points , among them at least 6 percent , which carried the aircraft , while acci@@ dentally forbidden kni@@ ves or other objects with blades .
less than 1 percent claimed they had late that they had er@@ ron@@ ged with fire@@ arms , amm@@ un@@ ition or explo@@ sives .
the survey with more than 1,000 persons - which was carried out by a jet Char@@ ter@@ service , Strat@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , was carried out - also noted that younger trav@@ ellers tend to mis@@ use the rules .
of those survey@@ ed , the enco@@ res that they have tried to fly with something which was forbidden by T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 per cent Mill@@ enni@@ als , compared with less than 15 percent , were members of generation X .
the most common items that were deliber@@ ately laid to T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
more than 3 percent reported to have borne objects with blades by security control , while 2.2 percent of female dents and 3.7 percent of the male dents have also confirmed that they deliber@@ ately banned drugs into the plane .
the company said it was inter@@ ro@@ gated in the whole country to find out how many acci@@ dentally s@@ mu@@ g@@ gel@@ ware brought by the airport security and how many things had been deliber@@ ately done .
it is no surprise that people who are s@@ mu@@ g@@ gled in s@@ mu@@ g@@ gling - know@@ ingly or unk@@ now@@ ingly - by security being those who are most often flying .
however , the company indicates that the T@@ SA guidelines are somewhat complicated and conf@@ using .
people are often uns@@ afe which liquids may take them or how much of it .
so there is no surprise that the largest amount of these items were forbidden by T@@ SA .
for a time , people thought T@@ SA could watch books as s@@ mu@@ g@@ gling ware .
liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k is no matter : tens of thousands of Tesla clients
electro @-@ Taus@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k are happy with the huge number of pre@@ ferences for his new Tesla &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far he has to suggest that a part of the customer has recovered their non @-@ binding reservations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the always triumph@@ ant figures , Tesla @-@ boss El@@ on Mus@@ k has betra@@ yed a different , less smooth number in the announcement of the recent quarters of the latest quar@@ terly market : the cancellations made during the new mass market model 3 .
in recent months , Mus@@ k had advert@@ ised more than 500.000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose extra@@ dition begins .
now Mus@@ k gives : a total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders has been with@@ drawn again 63@@ .000 .
critics have always pointed out that it is merely a non @-@ binding reservations .
in case of cancellation , Tesla pays 1000 Euros ( in the US $ 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 pounds ) . &quot; reservation payment &quot; is completely returned .
45@@ 5,000 of such non @-@ binding reservations , arranged mus@@ k in a telephone conference with analysts at present .
so that the cancellation of so far , some twelve percent of all orders could be encountered , the Tesla boss does not believe .
its argument : the challenge in the ambitious growth target is not on demand , but on the production page .
Tesla 8@@ 4,000 vehicles supplied last year .
2018 will be reduced to all models - 500,000 be one million by 2020 .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k there are only 1,@@ 800 reservations per day .
who ordered today a &quot; Model 3 , &quot; may only expect delivery in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla managed to drive its brand new , never even in practice tested production lines with maximum work@@ load .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
however , it comes to major delays , then the in@@ binding of the reservation could become a problem for Tesla .
because the company can not prevent un@@ satisfied customers , run away in dro@@ ves .

P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change when his agency proved to be the needs of state environmental authorities to act faster than previous administration .
he did not mention the complaint against his previous place in a Bundes@@ amt Court .
it is about a deadline that ran on October 1 for States to comply with the 2015 standards of ground @-@ level o@@ zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he would have hes@@ itation to give more time to study his authority to avoid the plan and to prevent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; entering local decisions or to hin@@ der economic growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was before his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump prosec@@ utor of Oklahoma , was a long time to be a reliable opponent of environmental protection regulations .
since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly passed , regul@@ ating or del@@ aying the chemical industry and industry of fossil fuels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the recent legal return for the post@@ ing regulatory sc@@ roll@@ back agenda . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last month , a Federal Court of Appeal in Washington decided that the EPA Administrator has exceeded its authority , as he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of Obama administration , the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane le@@ cks .
in a statement published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt suggested that his turn@@ around on o@@ zone standards simply intensi@@ fied the will@@ ingness of EPA to collabor@@ ate with the states through the complex process of timely ful@@ fill@@ ment of the new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under former administrative , the EPA often maintained the dead@@ lines for carrying out and then waiting to be charged by activ@@ ist groups and others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt who claimed the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in a regulation by judicial proceedings , and we take dead@@ lines seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we also accept the law and authority that gives us seriously . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the opinion of EPA said that P@@ ru@@ itt asks his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; power to delay and all other legally available &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to ensure that the rules &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in the Congress is pushing for a more comprehensive new version of the o@@ zone rules .
in the last month , legislation should delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .
the move has not yet been set to vote in the Senate .
the New York At@@ tor@@ ney General Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man who led the EPA in this week , said the group intended to maintain the statutory pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the revers@@ al of EPA - according to our complaints - is an important profit for health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yor@@ kers , which are directly affected by the smo@@ g , who flows directly from the smo@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said dres@@ sm@@ el@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new York joined in this case California , Connec@@ tic@@ ut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , Iowa , Maine , Massachusetts , Minnesota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ sy@@ l@@ van@@ ia , Rhode Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
soil @-@ Oz@@ on comes to react if poll@@ ut@@ ants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants , and other sources in the atmosphere of sunlight .
the resulting smo@@ g may cause serious respir@@ atory problems , and contribute to thousands of deaths each year .
representatives of public health system and environmental protection che@@ ered over p@@ im@@ itation surprising course change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is distur@@ bing as much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from the responsible for protecting the air we inhal@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ ori Ann Bur@@ d from the Center for Bi@@ ological Diversity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to fight against the ide@@ ological cr@@ us@@ ade of the Tr@@ ump @-@ government to tackle environmental poll@@ ut@@ ors and their special interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tum@@ lingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius church
750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the Berg@@ kirche the old cemetery @-@ area in Tum@@ my will be invited to a Ser@@ en@@ ade on Sunday , 16th July at 16.@@ 30 .
whether his idyllic location and beautiful views of the village is the historic St. Hil@@ arius plant a popular place to stay .
visitors from the sixth Bene@@ fi@@ z @-@ Ser@@ en@@ ade can en@@ chant for this powerful place .
the rescue and preserv@@ ation of the oldest building in the town have made friends and supporters of their concerns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Walter Mart@@ ini emphas@@ ises : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a unique gem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 12@@ 67 the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle has been mentioned for the first time in the Wür@@ ttem@@ bür@@ g@@ ical document : &quot; Graf Hermann von Sul@@ z sold &quot; the mountain with the present parish church of Tum@@ my and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver .
according to the document , according to the Ur@@ linger mountain apart from the former parish church also a beautiful farm , which belonged to the church or patron saint , and not vice versa .
so there were people there too .
as seen from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freu@@ den@@ stadt of 1858 , beside the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , who today are still visible in the village of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; mountain &quot; is the third , the marvellous sett@@ lements of the village .
old cards from the period around 1600 teach this historical geological conditions .
the god@@ father was developed from the early medieval Eig@@ enkir@@ che law .
one Lord , who built a church and occupied with a priest , remained the owner of this church , and was able to end@@ ure this church .
this was the right to deplo@@ y a priest or to propos@@ e a new priest .
there were three altars in the church and two bells in the tower .
the size of the two cerem@@ onies at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell lasted for the first time in 16@@ 92 but had to be released later in the Second World War in 1942 .
in the Thir@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the window discs were pushed and the bell were stolen .
the roof was un@@ sealed .
in 17@@ 96 French troops camped near the church .
they broke out the pul@@ pit and church chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
the remains of the church threatened to fall in 18@@ 09 .
until 1869 the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius cemetery also served as the last resting place for the dead .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was extended and the assistance of the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was canc@@ eled .
only the church tower was left .
in the New Year &apos;s eight 18@@ 34 , a storm split the church tower and half collapsed .
in order to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was demolished .
only the tower @-@ h@@ wer@@ g still remained today as a witness of the 750 years old church history .
today Horst K@@ allen@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em of the &quot; creative sen@@ iors &quot; as the successor of Dieter Dock@@ horn the help of the Hil@@ arius plant .
as organiz@@ ers invite friends and promot@@ ers of Tum@@ lin@@ gens on Sunday , 16 . July , for the sixth Ser@@ en@@ ade on the old cemetery to St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle one .
this is designed by the com@@ bo of the Kepler @-@ Gymnasium Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with words from Kurt Kü@@ bler and Reinhold Mat@@ te@@ is .
Hartmut Rom@@ ann speaks the closing word .
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 p.m .
admission is from 15.@@ 30 a.m .
to the end of the Ser@@ en@@ ade a trunk found in front of the cemetery .

the Ser@@ en@@ ade occurs only in dry weather .
the organiz@@ ers hope for many supporters for ob@@ taining the historical St. Hil@@ arius plant , which is important for tum@@ ours and sounds .
friends and supporters of Tum@@ lin@@ gens feel particularly committed to home @-@ care , such as Ser@@ en@@ ade Organ@@ iser Walter Mart@@ ini .
association wants to check approval of wind turbines
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ eim For@@ bes himself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not see the legal condition for construction and has therefore shifted to the Coun@@ cill@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; association is sum@@ mon@@ ed by Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CDU ) to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is un@@ lawful .
the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ is@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette no wind turbines could have been approved , as at the time in Vier@@ sen there only existed at the border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal a wind power concentration area .
within these concentration camps , construction and operation of wind turbines are possible , at the same time , the concentration zone causes a exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city .
such zones are to prevent a &quot; saving &quot; of the landscape .
although the town of Vier@@ sen had decided a second wind force zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette , but had not approved the Düsseldorf district court , because of a form of form@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to the lack of scheduled author@@ is@@ ite , the shared author@@ is@@ ite is still illegal and therefore back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christopher Er@@ k@@ ens , Chairman of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
current state of things : the city council once again decided to set up the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette ; author@@ ization of the District Government is still pending .
Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; this means that the organization of author@@ ization for the construction of wind turbines were excluded . &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance to the so@@ lic@@ itation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding writing have been passed since last week in circle four , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circuit takes them to examine the matter again .
however , it is not likely to do that the procedure is stopped .
with a view to the administrative proceedings in the Administ@@ rative Court , the circle on Thursday refused to express itself in terms of the argument of the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim . &quot;
the NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , is planning to build on an area on Bo@@ is@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette , from four to 200 metres high .
as early as last year , the company involved in which the town of Vier@@ sen is involved , lease agreements with the owner of the approx . 65 ac@@ re land .
with the establishment of four wind turbines , electricity needs to be covered by approximately 11 400 households , which corresponds to around one @-@ fifth of the electricity requirement of all quad@@ rant budgets .
the NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
last summer there was green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the wind farm L@@ inn@@ ich near Aachen and a stake in a wind turbine in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the circle Hein@@ sberg .
car and tractor Cra@@ fts together : woman dies in terrible accident
one terrible traffic accident has occurred on Friday morning at 10 o &apos;clock on the L 333 -@@ between low season and Bo@@ gel ( Rhine @-@ L@@ ahn circles ) .
a woman was severely injured .
two more people were slightly hurt .
the country road remained closed for hours .
according to police information , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ n@@ ich carried a car with their 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother as an accompanying person to the L 333 in the direction of Bo@@ gel .
city and dealer plan &quot; Home Sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; weekend
Bad Langen@@ sal@@ a@@ er and people from the region are to re@@ discover shopping facilities in the city centre in September .
the commercial club and city authorities want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to attract residents to shopping for shopping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as the chairman of the trade fair , Christian König , announced the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Home Sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weekend for customers to sens@@ it@@ ise what offers the own city away from the usual supermarket merchan@@ dise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
is therefore a market with regional vend@@ ors , similar to the weekly market .
local companies should also present themselves with their training places .
the shops of the city centre are to invite you to &quot; Mit@@ ter@@ bury Sh@@ opp@@ en . &quot;
the action does not only targets on the inhabitants of the city and the surrounding area .
in preparation , advertising spots on the radio , internet video and printed bags that point out on the action weekend , Christian König .
the City Council and Trade Association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means the industrial society and the city into a further stage of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; At@@ trac@@ tive Center &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; project . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these include new deals , such as the first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Active @-@ Day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with well @-@ made Sunday , talks with all business operators and hosts to move them to active participation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
attractive offers on Saturday and the ren@@ unci@@ ation on parking fees on this day are part of the concept .
customer potenti@@ als are also to be re@@ opened again .
these include tourist visitors and tourists .
but many locals also lost the inner city centre when shopping explo@@ ited .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end , everyone would have to contribute to the inner city - to rent the entire city and clubs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was said to overcome the Le@@ th@@ arg@@ y network that has partly spread , had said the king in the spring .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Birgit Stre@@ ich , leader of the I@@ HK Centers in Müh@@ l@@ hausen , said that five Thur@@ ing@@ ian towns are participating in the nationwide &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Home Sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to Bad Langen@@ sal@@ sa , this is Weimar , barren , Hei@@ ligen@@ stadt and Blei@@ cher@@ ode .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the day should advert@@ ise the appreciation of the local trade and provide its importance for the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stre@@ ich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the action under the lead of the I@@ HK and with many partners also make it clear that every citizen can affect his own environment itself . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Tr@@ ump placed in@@ scri@@ ptions by phone call Mexico under pressure because of the payment of the border wall
tran@@ scription of phone call between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and Le@@ aders from Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
on 27 January Tr@@ ump called on a phone call with the Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena Nie@@ to , to publicly tell that he would not pay for a planned border wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the U.S. president wanted him to publicly den@@ ounce the wall . according to reports , he said to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t tell the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump started building a wall with its promise to build a wall at the southern border of the USA , and s@@ ander to pay Mexico for the project .
tran@@ scription of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ Bull has also been published and revealed a cl@@ amped exchange .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr Turn@@ Bull that immig@@ rated to Australia , who immig@@ rated to Australia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that the existence on the trade that was medi@@ ated by the government Obama would look like a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees in the USA . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump concluded the call after he had said Mr Turn@@ Bull , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the most unpleasant call for the whole day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Moo@@ res &apos;s Ford massacre : activists perform rac@@ ist ly@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice again
a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mercury went through a group of viewers in rural Monroe , Georgia , and shr@@ inks to the Ford Bridge of Moore .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , a group of white men came out with rif@@ les to block his way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the leader of the mo@@ bs - a man middle age in a needle shar@@ k train - took a long train at its cig@@ ar and looking through the wind@@ shield .
inside , the in@@ mates indul@@ ged in fear .
&quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; the man ro@@ ared .
&quot; get it out of the car ! &quot;
scre@@ ams rent the silence when a young black man was sh@@ attered by the passenger seat .
luckily this terrible scene is played , which was played on July 22 , only one im@@ position .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if a loop around the neck of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is thrown , almost everyone in the audience looks very real si@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2005 , civil rights to Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge come back to im@@ itate the night , in the two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com and George and Mae Murray Dor@@ sey - from K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one has ever been indicted for murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is really in@@ comprehen@@ sible that in all these years no one person was arrested - although we see them in our con@@ greg@@ ations , although we know who they are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks who helps with the organization . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is a dirt spot on a history , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former Congress of Georgia and a life @-@ long citizen .
it serves for him as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual reminder of the Monroe community that has never been corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want criminal prosecution , we want to finish , we want to cure , but first we have to receive justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we cannot get to cure and reconciliation , until we receive justice . &quot;
one place of jurisdiction sets out a sheet of bed on the dead of one of the victims of the Moore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ch on July 27 , 1946 .
according to FBI files , which were received by N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected in the ly@@ ch@@ process .
but no one has ever been indicted .
although the susp@@ ects remain on the open foot for decades , civil rights say that the double motivation for Lyn@@ ch actions in the whole city was always known : Politics and sex .
in April 1946 , the Supreme Court rendered a decision by the Supreme Court of Georgia to vote for the first time in the summer campaign .
about the same time as the vote st@@ out according to the FBI &apos;s FBI , Roger Mal@@ col@@ m , a white land owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , settled down during a fight - rep@@ or@@ tedly due to a woman .
Broo@@ ks said that rum@@ or was in the city that H@@ ester was slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby was wearing her husband was not of her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Harrison , a prominent white land@@ owner , 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , so the FBI .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her cou@@ sins Mae Murray and George Dor@@ sey in prison .
but when she went away from prison , the Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge approaching , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b approached the car .
&quot; as it turns out , it was Harrison that has prepared and arranged the Mor@@ de , includes a FBI report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspi@@ racy between the state and local prosec@@ utions that were not only involved in the murder , the evidence removed and the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks form@@ ulates it even more magnificent .
&quot; it was a electoral massacre , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you register , and if you vote , this will happen here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for almost a decade Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the annual re@@ position of the Moore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
their presentation is descri@@ p@@ tive , gri@@ pping and is justified in a kind of deep rac@@ ism , of which many believed that he does not exist in America .
it is hard to watch , and still more difficult to look , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ ch because we are confron@@ ted with its ha@@ zz@@ iness in us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I cannot build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen or hear what I have done through . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest black - in a room and lou@@ dly , as Gre@@ ene began a well @-@ played overview of the play .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is a green co @-@ director here .
he has played the role of the chef C@@ lan@@ mit@@ es for years , but he said that the role will never become simpler .
&quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not so , &quot; said Mar@@ dan@@ gh .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it is very important to get this story in life because we don &apos;t want to return to those times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room the actor D@@ arri@@ us Brad@@ sh@@ aw and Nick Ras@@ con@@ a tried to play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , their lines .
the piece starts with Mal@@ col@@ m , the tester and he p@@ ushes him angry that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , n --- he hid from my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ras@@ con@@ a bl@@ ends the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! &quot; said Ras@@ con@@ a asked .
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still ch@@ uck@@ ling .
&quot; I just don &apos;t think white people then &quot; n --- he said . &quot;
&quot; yet , one of the other black actors .
&quot; you just have to hit the hard &quot; R. &apos; . &quot;
and exactly there is the energy in the room , a feeling of comra@@ des replaces the un@@ eas@@ iness .
everyone is engaged to get this right , not just because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene begins again .
this time Ras@@ con@@ a says the N word , he says it sharp and with re@@ print .
absolutely nobody laughs .
the repet@@ ition ends non@@ violent and fast .
there are scre@@ ams , casts and then silence .
a woman dressed with a tragedy , stands on the cor@@ p@@ ses of actor and leads cheap holidays sad speech &quot; St@@ range Fru@@ it . &quot;
your voice breaks out in every second word .
about a hundred metres behind it , a group of about four dozen viewers were wi@@ ped away sweat and tears from the eyes .
the audience is almost equally divided between black and white .
a couple is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many come down just down the street .
you have experienced Geor@@ gi@@ as impressive humidity almost eight hours , if Broo@@ ks leads them on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up to this point , Mor@@ de has remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , when you found on the same country , where the ly@@ n@@ ch mur@@ ders took place , the air feels gli@@ st@@ atically . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the last notes of the song sound , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and in@@ spect the body .
children ho@@ cks on their heads , register the f@@ ake blood and the silent body and whis@@ per@@ ing one another .
&quot; they &apos;re not really dead , &quot; mur@@ m@@ urs a little boy , as if he wants to remember .
after a few minutes , Gre@@ ene ow@@ es the crowd - and suddenly it &apos;s over .
the actors throw the ly@@ n@@ eil and wi@@ pe out her tears .
Brad@@ sh@@ aw surro@@ unds Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the suit that played the C@@ lan@@ ord .
Nick Ras@@ con@@ a embra@@ ces two of his players and then breaks together in their arms , and the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks through him .
&quot; it is okay , &quot; whis@@ pers one of the women .
&quot; we know that this is not in your heart .
you did it for a reason . &quot;
later the audience will enter@@ tain the dinner together with the actors .
a white couple from Atlanta attached to a table and ch@@ atting with a black couple who had just met her .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski strug@@ gled to find words which feelings that feeling has left .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... from people to come as you look and doing what they look like , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what really does with me lets me believe that the Lyn@@ ch is still going on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today it is called the only police shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room Ty@@ rone keeps Broo@@ ks farm at his table , he e@@ ats and reminds of the civil rights .
he said he started planning the performance in the next year .
&quot; the demand is inspiring in a certain way , because it describes the fear of what we have en@@ du@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning . &quot; he said .
&quot; it is so if we don &apos;t learn anything from it , then it can happen again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he who does not study his own history , he who does not know his own history is condemned to repeat them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ar@@ ks@@ and@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) shows a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pl@@ aste and El@@ aste &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; logo in Berlin , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pl@@ aste and El@@ aste &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; logo from the East &apos;s Times , or the New York Stock Exchange . &quot; &quot; &quot;
before that a Mercedes classic car is par@@ ked in which the Rhein@@ foolish man pose as a rock , or alternatively a Is@@ etta .
st@@ acked oil @-@ barrels remind of Cast@@ or@@ fs Leit@@ mot@@ iv - Money , power and gre@@ ed - that draws from his &quot; Ring &quot; st@@ aging .
the three Rhein@@ foolish - sung by Stephanie Hou@@ tz@@ eel , Wie@@ b@@ ke Leh@@ m@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ise as already in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold . &quot;
K@@ ess seduc@@ es Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , in Hollywood man@@ ier a cor@@ p@@ se in the trunk and give the Kra@@ wall@@ o @-@ Cli@@ que .
Stephen M@@ illing sings the wonderfully fi@@ del@@ ity Hagen , who surro@@ unds the aura of a heav@@ y@@ weight box@@ ers .
brutal the scene when he sm@@ iled Siegfried .
later Gun@@ ther ( Markus oak ) still needs to believe .
the audience thanks it to the ensemble with strong applause .
Foster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and Con@@ ductor Jan@@ owski , who is stor@@ my and stor@@ my hands to Merkel @-@ rob@@ ber@@ y .
there are great applause for the festival orchestra which shows itself on stage for the first time - in view of the big heat back in leg@@ ume clothing .
the appearance was eag@@ erly a@@ waited by Frank Cast@@ orf and his match team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2013 he had to leave a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ch@@ ops in which the single &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls were in place in 2013 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is likely to be pleased about this .
&quot; you notice that the audience has grown together with the &quot; Ring &quot; in a certain way , &quot; she said shortly before the performance of the d@@ pa .
the audience did not only have a form of peace with cast@@ ers , but it also has grown an understanding for its view .
I draw a positive res@@ ume .
max number works as a volunteer
they work equally at several locations in their volunteer year .
where anywhere ?
quantity : normally in Stein@@ furt at the furniture shop , once a week I help here in Gre@@ ven at the furniture bridge .
and I have already worked in the open day day at school .
how are your experiences with it ?
quantity : it &apos;s a nice , wide spectrum that I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
you are now 26 years , so a late volunteer program .
how does it come ?
quantity : I made my S@@ LC exam .
and then we have a degree of construction studies , let &apos;s say successfully .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know that it is the wrong thing for me and I want to do something else with people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then I asked myself what are you doing .
make a social year there is a social year , there you can see how it is on site , in the burning point , perhaps , really is .
and was it like that ?
quantity : I have collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the social media in the winter semester .
I will probably study two , probably in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne , a social worker and study at the Fach@@ hochschule Ham@@ m .
is it not a bit unusual , while volunteers have several different locations to volunteer ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
it probably depends on where you will be FS@@ J .
you can do it from the anti@@ quity to youth work - in all kinds of fac@@ ets of social work .
with me it was very varied .
I was partly in the O@@ gs , so in the afternoon session .
that was the right thing for me , which has ger@@ ated me .
I could realise my own strengths and see how it really runs .
other than in civil engineering ?
quantity : well , here it &apos;s not about to calculate stem cells .
there are always other people in the head , which each have a very different story behind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether a refugee , a young man out of the family has been out@@ dated - you always have to be respon@@ sive to each other . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very interesting .
and you had no touch of touch ?
amount : I &apos;m not the guy .
it is a field that gives a lot .
much love , much kindness .
there are also negative moments , but life is just like life .
Pear@@ son makes another 3,000 jobs and shortened the dividend to revi@@ ve the business
the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday , she will cut further 3,000 jobs and its interim divi@@ ding around 72 percent , as another restructuring programme will be started to overcome the pressure being confron@@ ted with the company .
the job breakdown , the General Director John Fall@@ on , was mainly ancho@@ red for the end of 2018 and early 2019 , comes in addition to its previous re@@ structure , where 4,000 places were lost .
Pear@@ son announced a plan for cost reduction in May in a third cost reduction plan to revi@@ ve another 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) to revi@@ ve a business through the fast step towards digital learning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company that had expressed his involvement in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House on the partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann reported that the outlook for the business year remains unchanged , after the first half an increase of 1 per cent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kon@@ vo@@ i attack by Kabul : NATO soldier killed in suicide bom@@ bers
a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ voy in the Afghan capital Kabul and killed several other soldiers , say officials .
five soldiers and an interpre@@ ter were injured , divided into Nato &apos;s declaration .
according to the incident in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h , three civilians were killed in the incident in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h .
the bombing is the last violence that Afghanistan has hit this month - on Tuesday , more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Her@@ at .
on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an opinion of NATO , it means that the explosion on Thursday evening had occurred when a joint pat@@ rol with Afghan army was attacked by a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; impro@@ vised spr@@ inkl@@ ed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by persons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this statement says that all injured in a stable state and in the U.S. military hospital were treated at the Bag@@ ram air@@ field .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group , known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h , is a big concern for NATO troops at the nearby excav@@ ram .
according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % of them in the capital .
at the end of July , a suicide @-@ car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shi@@ ite district of Kabul .
the Taliban said they would have executed this attack .
on 31 May , a massive bombing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the most mur@@ ky milit@@ ant attack in the country since the US led troops hit the Taliban out of power in 2001 .
the violence under@@ lines the prec@@ ari@@ ous security situation in Afghanistan , since U.S. president Donald Tr@@ ump weak@@ ened , the number of U.S. troops to raise the military and police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say that the suicide bom@@ bers in Kabul has caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , politics , and in particular in the call of President Ash@@ raf G@@ hani as well .
EPA returns to delay the smo@@ g rule after complaints
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has taken a decision to kill the government of the government of Obama , after which the states are obliged to con@@ strain the Smo@@ g @-@ caused emissions . this took a day after 15 countries def@@ endant the agency because of the pac@@ emaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to do so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oz@@ on@@ struc@@ tions 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she fore@@ sees the commitment of the agency to work with states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue with and remember that we respond to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA Chief Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June the intention of EPA to specify the o@@ zone provisions - in which parts of the country would have to specify where inc@@ isions are to be made to severe air quality standards - to delay more str@@ ingent air quality standards - to delay a year by October 2018 .
a group of 15 mostly democratic states , along with the Columbia District , filed a complaint on Tuesday , saying that effort was illegal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to resur@@ rec@@ t a broad range of environmental impact , former president Barack Obama , to boost economic growth according to tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , these efforts have triggered the impact of Democrats and reserves , which concerns about the effects of larger emissions on public health .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EP@@ O website says that the inhal@@ ation of air , the o@@ zone contains &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lung function &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and rein@@ force the respir@@ atory symptoms &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as asthma . &quot; &quot; &quot;
community wants common room
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end , the decision was clear : in two opponents , the Municipal Council of Flu@@ orn rises the establishment of a community in the future senior hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the discussion there is an important information : the purchase contract for the missing part is signed , Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ adas . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although it is still going to continue until now the church community belongs to the municipal property , yet there is no plans for the project by a private investor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is a discussion about a common room .
one of the two investors , who are still in the boat , has offered to meet the community .
on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - around 55 square metres - and an adjacent terrace with a total of 70 square meters of space for a special price .
the administration and the majority of the council pending , such a common room does not appear as a meeting point for the residents of the sen@@ i@@ or@@ just living area , but open to the church .
as an example , the word of &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; made the round .
the decision , which was decided by the provision of funds for the current household , has already been decided in the last autumn .
the building is located in the renovation area .
the establishment of a community area would be reported that T@@ j@@ aden reports , with 60 percent of 30 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision to sign@@ alize the investor , that in this regard , does not want to throw a b@@ ill@@ ets between the legs , the conclusion that both saddle - and the result of the environment - as well as P@@ ult@@ d@@ ach &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - as well as P@@ ult@@ d@@ ach &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
need@@ less , so does not mean Wil@@ fried S@@ oh@@ mer , be this addition .
when it helps : it unanim@@ ously passes the panel .
not so easy it goes to the common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Daniela &apos;s call refers to the many own buildings with which you are not so far forward with which you are now looking for common room in the window , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do so hard with that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger absolutely speaks for the common room - but absolutely against a municipal involvement .
it sees a conce@@ aled subsi@@ dy to any@@ how wealth or even foreign investors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the case , because with the acquisition of the area you don &apos;t give a supplement but will receive a real , in the branch of doubt , the counter @-@ speech is . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sta@@ ig@@ ner &apos;s request to deliber@@ ate the decision , finds three pro@@ pon@@ ents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so it remains with two opponents in the original program , the Stefan H@@ aller summar@@ izes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we sum@@ med up the decision , we make a huge step in our infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

FC Bayern Munich must refra@@ in from the Super@@ cup against Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund to David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago
the Super@@ cup takes place without him : David Al@@ aba must su@@ ck the game against Dortmund .
FC Bayern travels to Dortmund from FC Bayern to attend the first mandatory match of the new season .

in addition , Manuel Neuer , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing .
for five defe@@ ats in the past six test , An@@ cel@@ otti did the physical condition and the missing balance in the game of his team is responsible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most important point is balance in the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last was not good . &quot;
but the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official season of season .
&quot; football is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation .
I have great trust that my team showed these qualities .
the crew is ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to play intelligent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who expects a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; difficult &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; intense game . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Du@@ el of the two German football @-@ heav@@ y@@ weights attract the fans in their spell .
the game is sold out with 8@@ 1.@@ 360 viewers , the German soccer league ( DF@@ L ) shared on Friday .
hiking in the Har@@ z Star star
in Har@@ z the nationwide &quot; star path &quot; should be developed .
this is the association Stern@@ warte Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a Planet@@ arium path in Göttingen - since 2003 .
a path called &quot; Star@@ path &quot; will be coming to the information needs of many Har@@ ten@@ visitors .
he connect nature , science , movement and spor@@ tive performance .
the members want to set up boards along the planned route and inform them about stars and star@@ bases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; during the first phase to 2018 , the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Acces@@ sible installations to five to six places &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
question@@ men St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Ho@@ he@@ ge@@ i@@ ß and Sie@@ ber .
the information on the tablets are to be supple@@ mented by the Internet .
therefore , a good mobile network reception plays a role in the location selection .
acc@@ essibility is a crit@@ eri@@ on .
later the path is to be extended by train .
&quot; on the path of star@@ path , the viewer learn a lot of knowledge , for example through the physics of the individual stars , &quot; explained the association .
in addition , they learned why stars could have different colors , or why a star more light than another , although it was much further away .
medi@@ ates also to find a selected star in which constellation can be seen and when it is best to see .
the association has been operating in the Berg@@ städ@@ t St. Andre@@ as@@ berg as early as 2014 , the highest ob@@ servatory in Northern Germany .
according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation , the location in the middle of the Har@@ z national park is one of the six dar@@ k@@ est regions in Germany .
frequently from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ me@@ da galaxy were clearly visible with naked eye .
since 2003 there has been a little similar to the initiative of the Planet@@ arium in Göttingen since 2003 such as the planned star throw - the Planet@@ arium .
beginning before Geb@@ har@@ ds Hotel in Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planet leads along with his st@@ els up to the Hain@@ berg and to the ob@@ servatory - as well as an &quot; ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ restri@@ al &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ ahs ( identical ) with the Planet Sed@@ na .
the St@@ elen with the individual planets - including the d@@ warf planet down@@ stream Plu@@ to at the end point - are precisely placed at a distance and a scale of one to two billion .
the earth shr@@ inks to a ball of 6.5 mm in diameter , while the sun measures exactly 75 metres away , after almost 70 cen@@ timet@@ res .
the whole planet &apos;s distance amounts to a good four kilometres .
while the sunlight needs to be about eight hours , pede@@ stri@@ ans need a good hour to st@@ ele with Plu@@ to .
pede@@ stri@@ ans are faster than light in the universe .
but the march towards the next fixed star would last half a year .
Mi@@ key Garcia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time to discuss a show@@ down show@@ down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mi@@ key Garcia who should stand in a coll@@ ision course to stage the most exciting boxing contest in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Garcia was the un@@ defeated World Boxing Council Ligh@@ tweight Champion , down the corridor , to greet Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Boxing Organization Super @-@ Feder@@ ica @-@ Champion .
according to Gar@@ ci@@ as &apos;s victory through unanim@@ ous ruling over the former four @-@ divisions of Adri@@ en Bron@@ der on Saturday , both fighters were members of the top five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und @-@ List .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I stretched out the right hand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How is it to you , champion ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I wish you good luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko is def@@ ending his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 19 : 00 pm .
when the pair posed for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ mas noted that a possible show@@ down between the battles would be the &quot; perfect mag@@ n@@ itude . &quot;
&quot; I am a former spring weight , &quot; re@@ minded Garcia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I increased to Bron@@ der &#91; on 140 pounds &#93; , but I &apos;m not so big . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I want to avoid a weight .
and he has to move to lightweight weights &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
they demand the fans .
let &apos;s give them that . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko agreed to .
&quot; boxing needs this struggle . &quot;
climate asked if it should be at pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko must fight with a 135 pound debut this year in order to make an appointment in the next summer with Garcia one date ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) , who also had an interest in the fight against the winner of the Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Campbell in the Forum on September 23 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this battle could take place in the Pay @-@ per @-@ View mode , because all fans after him have asked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Garcia said , and pressed later to fight on the network that offers the best financial package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can produce this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Garcia said that he reck@@ on Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a huge fighter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he may take part in his Saturday battle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Lom@@ ach@@ enko held up with the generous praise for Garcia and said that he don &apos;t think the three combat champion from River@@ side , look very slowly , sorry Mi@@ key ... you wanted to be the Ko @-@ Off . &quot;
Garcia said that the focus was to show stroke strength , then boxes .
both said they could feel the momentum that built up for their own struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the battle that must be performed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other fight creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m more than happy to work with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Garcia said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko said , &quot; I waited for the top fighter , and this is Mi@@ key .
it will be a great struggle . &quot;
four Ob@@ last to T@@ ire Po@@ wers
four people were seriously injured in an accident on the A7 on Thursday afternoon .
after first information , the driver of a Opel Z@@ af@@ ira was lost at 16.@@ 30 shortly before the termination of the market , presumably after a tyre plat@@ ter , the control of his vehicle .
the passenger car fli@@ pped to the right into the dis@@ appointment , where he struck and then lag@@ ged on the roof in the grave .
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were seriously injured in the accident .
during the initial provision of the injuries through the rescue service , the A7 toward the north for approximately one hour was closed , then traffic on the left road was resolved on the left side of the accident .
Fort@@ unas Hoffmann : &quot; rotating chain works better &quot;
Andre Hoffmann appears after 2 : 2 at the end of the season open@@ er in Braunschweig , that the optim@@ isation of the defense information is available in Au@@ e points .
Andre Hoffmann was happy with the first match as well , as with the result , they would not have been the two opponents at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two opponents &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many opponents &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we have to watch out even better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the def@@ ensive player of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Erz@@ gebirge , the dirt chain should also be further optimised .
and a fool after a fre@@ ed@@ o@@ ß don &apos;t want to catch the lag@@ oons as well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future , there will be so one that nobody will present himself to the line with Michael ( R@@ ensing ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his crew is better to get better after the experience in the preparation with the three chain .
&quot; I don &apos;t know how to act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his coach Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann appears to be sure &quot; because we have just been able to build up well on the three @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and N@@ iko Gie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pr@@ er@@ equ@@ is@@ ite is , but , that we do not harmon@@ ise even better and we do not afford to set up so many ab@@ uses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , Hoffmann also goes to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if one cannot speak after a draw of a mis@@ erable start , don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the performance could be quite okay , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if we have to focus on Sunday with four points and we will certainly be able to talk on poker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of them wanted to know nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the start into the season I first came after six to eight game days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who would not speak of an advantage over Au@@ e , just because the game of the Sax@@ ons in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be stopped . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they can begin with a home game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann may have believed that players from Au@@ e might even be a bit fresh@@ er , as they wouldn &apos;t have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una for an asc@@ ension into the bones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they don &apos;t know 100 percent where they currently stand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Interior of Fort@@ una . &quot; &quot; &quot;
guests from the Rhin@@ eland as a lighter favorite place on Sunday at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we take them away , only because we have the claim to come under the first six , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is very positive with just a defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are no squ@@ ad in the 2nd Bundesliga , which you have to hit from before , &quot; explains Fort@@ unas Chef coach .
&quot; to make such a statement would be arro@@ gant and arro@@ gant . &quot;
and so Funk@@ el wants to experience his players on Sunday .
new results of the Swedish asylum application tests published
the latest results of testing for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , which were subjected to a new method for medical assessment of age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons older than 18 are older . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish National Institute for For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( Vic@@ tims ) has begun with the implementation of tests last year .
they should be more precise during the asylum proceedings , after the Swedish mig@@ r@@ ational authority ( Mig@@ r@@ ations@@ committed ) because of errors in the evaluation of the correct age of some refugees were critic@@ ized .
up to this day , Mig@@ r@@ ations@@ .@@ 6.@@ 880 has been sent to tests and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 .
eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , while in further 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
in 4@@ 32 cases , the conclusion that the person &quot; may be &quot; possibly under 18 years old . &quot;
the tests will only be carried out in cases where the age of the person is question@@ ed .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson at the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are permanent in recent months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see no big difference in the statistics of the past months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the magazine The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high proportion of cases in which the person was judged as over 18 years , does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ ers has lied about his age .
in May , the Agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there was 4@@ 42 cases that they suggest that the sub@@ ordin@@ ated person was 18 years or older . &quot;
when the news published S@@ ven@@ ska Dag@@ bl@@ adet susp@@ ects the 5@@ 81 published results , it noted that in 243 of these cases the person had said openly that she would be 18 years old .
the method of medical age assessment , which are analysed in x @-@ rays of male teeth and MRI shots of knee @-@ joints , which are then analyzed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , was critic@@ ized also in some areas .
a scep@@ tics is the En@@ do@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus des Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute whose work includes the assessment of biological maturity of people to see whether they were used earlier or later than the pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think the type of measuring should be used .
pre@@ judi@@ ce the biological age in this way is very uns@@ afe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we can &apos;t say it , we should not do as if we could , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the newspaper Metro . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gö@@ ran@@ sson at the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , however , defended the accuracy of tests : &quot; in general , they can say that the risk of jud@@ ging a child as an adult is low .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest risk is in this case , if the person is under 18 , this case is about 10 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fully in Plan
the work on the three bridges of the road 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are progres@@ sing well .
on Wednesday , seven tons of heavy emphasis on the bridge was installed at the eastern outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very good at the time , it is super , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reinhold Lei@@ cht , manager of road construction and traffic in the Regierung@@ sprä@@ si@@ dium Freiburg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in April , work began at the same time at all three renovated bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the construction is scheduled for October and Lei@@ cht is sure that the schedule is maintained .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads across the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a v@@ aul@@ ted bridge made of concrete , which is cl@@ ad with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4,@@ 80 meters .
it was built in 1900 .
like the other two bridges , it is now come into the years .
in order to ensure the stability and traffic safety , the three construction works are thoroughly renovated .
the two other bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were erected in 1939 and are twelve , and / or 10,@@ 60 metres long .
the bridge at the outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach has now on Wednesday morning on the northern side a 1.@@ 30 meters wide and seven tons of heavy so@@ iling cap .
this is a cruci@@ fix@@ ion that is also used as an operating way .
on Friday the southern part of the bridge , a 2,@@ 20 metre width of the bridge will be used on Friday .
then the pedestrian wal@@ k@@ way is to go .
the special thing is that it is about finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges have already been equipped with the patented bri@@ ck@@ caps .
a special touch feeling has the laying of lines through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
for there , there is a glass fibre cable attached to which many companies are connected .
the local residents were informed about the project in advance of work .
in addition , fish and cra@@ bs had to be f@@ ished .
for the bridges between the building farm and the gathering in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is narrow @-@ lane through a traffic light .
for the construction work on the bridge at Lau@@ ter@@ bach location the road is locked in the area of the bridge at the altitude of the &quot; Tann@@ en@@ hof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den . &quot;
the costs for the three breasts are 700 000 Euros .
the whole is financed through the country .
AF@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : under protest at German potato salad
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not so frequent that parties go on a strand , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( AF@@ D ) , comes together , what else is difficult to do with a hat . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the parties involved in the Kre@@ ist@@ ag Vol@@ can@@ ine ( CDU , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , lin@@ ke ) belong to a wide alliance that shows peace@@ fully on this day because the AF@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stadthalle Ron@@ dell has a big campaign for campaign .
and known names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land the top duo for the parliamentary elections on 24 September , and the vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
however , those who are in place before the start of the event , do not want to listen to AF@@ D developers , but demonstrate .
the motto &quot; The Eifel remains colorful . &quot;
the city pic@@ kn@@ ick was originally planned under the motto &quot; Show all in a table &quot; on the Brun@@ nen@@ platz , but now takes place on the parking lot below the Ron@@ d@@ ells - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the AF@@ D event in the Stadthalle .
a colorful picture that offers here .
and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , Chair@@ woman of the Forum A world and one of the decisive organiz@@ ers , really pleased : &quot; great , how many people came together here . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is music and plenty of food , including a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ur@@ ian potato salad , which could also eat the AF@@ D without problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the woman who brought him away . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police destro@@ ys many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence primarily at the railway station , which is just a few meters away from the venues .
how did the AF@@ D actually come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes reported by the AF@@ D volcan@@ os , he tried to make such an event and get the surcharge .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had asked her in Dau@@ n , but there was not enough parking place because of the already built Lau@@ ren@@ ti@@ us kir@@ ch .
well , the Ron@@ dell , Hom@@ pes is happy that &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with a view to the event on the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ vor@@ platz , he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the good right of people , main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also does : against 20 o &apos;clock in the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ vor@@ platz a band for entertainment , in the Stadthalle diverse speakers , including the rh@@ ein@@ land @-@ pf@@ äl@@ z@@ mic AF@@ D @-@ chairman Uwe Young .
there are about 200 list@@ eners in the hall that the top can@@ di@@ dat@@ in for the parliamentary elections , Alice Wei@@ del , and the vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch will hold their spe@@ e@@ ches .
the police presence remains unchanged , but so far the officials had a peaceful evening .
a little more than one hour lasts the AF@@ D event , the guests on the fore@@ court have a longer breath , but also there is some time after 21 o &apos;clock .
the police can remove the police - no special inci@@ dents .
trombone meets trumpet
a res@@ ult@@ ant with the Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ aun@@ ists Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is available in the series of Has@@ l@@ acher Kloster@@ Concer@@ tos tomorrow , Sunday , at 20 o &apos;clock in the con@@ vent church .
&quot; &quot; &quot; together with Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ro@@ sla@@ v Pet@@ kov he gives a concert under the slogan &quot; Black Sea &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bal@@ kan@@ fol@@ klore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meets a classical German education with roots in brass music . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both solo@@ ists are winner and winner of numerous international competitions and have held sol@@ op@@ positions in European plant orchest@@ ras .
so Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is the prestigious Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is a solo@@ ist of the SWR Symphony Orchestra .
both uni@@ fies the desire not only to exceed the limits on their instruments but also to merge the boundaries of different gen@@ res .
so Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like in a new v@@ ault , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &quot; world music &quot; together with Bulgarian fol@@ klore , and in the play &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the Jaz@@ ze@@ ch@@ op@@ re@@ ist@@ ber@@ gers N@@ ils W@@ ogram , mix classic , jazz and free games to a fascinating overall art work .
this spring of the programme was first performed in spring@@ time with huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ rit was written specifically for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ l@@ acher monastery church with their particular acou@@ st@@ ics are involved in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Stewart talks about her bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; some people love grilled cheese and they will eat it until the end of their life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kri@@ sten Stewart was quite openly about their bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once I bite in grilled cheese , I think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh that was cool , what comes next ? &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the probably best @-@ known relationship of the Hollywood star was to her &quot; T@@ wi@@ light &quot; colleagues from Robert Patt@@ inson , who ultimately went bitter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite all this , the brunette actor compared to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s B@@ az@@ aar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; magazine : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was in love with everyone I &apos;ve had . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; or do you believe it , I have played it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after her separation Kri@@ sten was said to be bis@@ ex@@ ual : &quot; I have always lived and seriously believed the du@@ alism .
so it has never been confused or disabled .
I never liked it to be taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , she suffered according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bang Show@@ biz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in school , rather than a Bu@@ b dressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that really hurt me .
when I was eleven told me the children , I would look like a Bu@@ b .
I felt really being attacked , fri@@ ghtened and ashamed .
now I look back and think me : &apos; girls , be proud of you ! &apos; .
especially the public did not tell their love life : &quot; people expect you to be in a certain way and anno@@ ys me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps some consider myself to be than@@ kl@@ ess , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself from all the public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Governor of West Virginia announces that he changes the party
the democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday night with a rally with President Tr@@ ump to switch to the party .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether you like it or not , demo@@ cr@@ ats have removed from me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Governor Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and much thinking ... today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rally broke out in Ju@@ bel .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , &quot; added Justice .
&quot; as a coach , I would say that it is time to play a different game . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised a great announcement at the West Virginia Rally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice does not endor@@ se the democratic candidate Hillary Clinton .
justice , who is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes report that he owns coal mines in five states and has inherited a carbon business from his father .
it is worth 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , the Republi@@ can National Committee kicked off on Thursday evening in which it said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the party change by Governor Justice is another blow for a Democratic Party , which would rather hin@@ der us to work in order to make our land great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; with only 15 Gou@@ vern@@ ment and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Governor Justice is only the final re@@ jection of a party , which is from above to below without leadership , and is unable to find a positive , pur@@ ifying message , &quot; said the R@@ onna Miss R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel , in a statement to the C@@ BS news .
Co@@ e pra@@ ises the &quot; honest &quot; Russian excuse for d@@ oping sc@@ andal
&quot; &quot; &quot; the world leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday , which he described as a manifest excuse from Russia to a d@@ oping sc@@ andal , but he repeated it is not the moment for the country to be resumed in sports . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Russia &apos;s athle@@ tics boss Dmit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ ak@@ ht@@ in said during the IA@@ AF convention on the eve of Athletics Championships that the exile of his country was correct and that he decided to fight against d@@ oping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the athletes , those at competitions gold and silver medals were taken away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF congress voted for the maintenance of the ban , which was imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) had found evidence on state @-@ funded D@@ oping in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was an open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF @-@ President Co@@ e the rep@@ orters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entire Council and the entire congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has witnessed by itself , that she has experienced some pretty hot times and everything is possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e said he is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleased &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Russia accept the criteria for its re@@ introduction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think that progress has been achieved , but Congress supports the recommendations of Task Force , that this is not the moment to use Russia again , &quot; said Co@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the basic principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the de@@ pra@@ ved system &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he added : &quot; &quot; &quot;
nin@@ ete@@ en Russian athletes will begin at the Athletics Championships , starting on Friday in London according to the strict IA@@ AF criteria as a neutral actors .
the leader of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday , that Russia still has some of the criteria to perform .
drug tests are still in@@ sufficient and forbidden co@@ aches are still free , he said rep@@ orters in London following a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council .
tragedy in Mali abandoned soldiers
during a fun@@ eral in the North H@@ ess@@ ische Frit@@ z@@ lar , around 1000 people of the two have thought of a helicopter landing in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the Dom@@ stadt under high security set@@ backs .
to still un@@ clari@@ fied failure , Secretary of Defense Ursula of the Le@@ yen ( CDU ) said nothing .
but they referred the two opposite pilots but as &quot; C@@ ain@@ ner of their s . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow in front of this highest sacrifice which they have produced in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old staff of Nord@@ h@@ essen came to live on Wednesday one week ago in the West African Mali .
their mer@@ its were transferred to Germany and accompanied by a dead guard of the Bundes@@ wehr in the Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er cathedral St. Peter , on Thursday .
at first we took only the relatives in the Church .
afterwards , the fun@@ eral in the circle of family , eng@@ aging friends , from representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr and Politics .
among them were also H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CDU ) and the General Manager of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wie@@ ker .
they lay down ro@@ ses , who were his arm in arm in their arm .
before the church , Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas .
Secretary of Defense of the Le@@ yen signed the in@@ verse soldiers as &quot; highly decorated &quot; and conven@@ ed .
the Stab@@ ili@@ pper had built the flight operations of the fighter helicopter tiger in Frit@@ z@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tig@@ ers of its regim@@ ents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , commander of the regim@@ ent , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this crew could not turn off the crash , nobody would have missed the collapse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
doubts about the UN mission in Mali was a former Minister of the Le@@ yen , whose use is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he also is of high importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country by which we are only separated by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the fun@@ eral the sc@@ ary was brought out of the cathedral .
when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not make any information .
Prince Hen@@ rik doesn &apos;t want a grave next to his wife
after his death , the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik , ( 83 ) , will not be buried next to his wife .
he shared the Royal House on Thursday .
traditionally , the Danish royal couple is buried in the cathedral Church of Ros@@ kil@@ de .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ gaard met a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ agus for the two .
the Queen has agreed with the decision of her husband , named it in the message .
where Prince Hen@@ rik will be buried , be un@@ clear .
but he did not int@@ end to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a H@@ eh@@ l that he was not happy with his title .
after the asc@@ ension of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would like to become king .
in 2016 , he retired and cont@@ empl@@ ates the title &quot; prin@@ c@@ esses . &quot;
since Hen@@ rik in Denmark did not receive the title and the function he would not see himself in comparison to his wife - not after the death , LE@@ NE B@@ alle@@ by , chief spokes@@ woman in the Danish king &apos;s house .
where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will eventually be un@@ clear .
but he did not int@@ end to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark .
he likes the country for which he worked in the last 50 years .
the native Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French no@@ ble@@ man , had met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London .
at the Th@@ ames , he worked in the French Embassy .
during his later wife the sympath@@ ies of the people always flew along , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand in his almost 50 years of government at the Dan@@ es .
in a auto@@ biography Hen@@ rik on the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival everything was dealt with .
my name was sw@@ aying , I preferred wine instead of beer , Sil@@ k sm@@ ur@@ fs instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Citro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , Tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ ls , which I smo@@ ked instead of Virginia to@@ Tob@@ acco , and to be able to be the brand of social @-@ critical intellec@@ tu@@ als , I could not hope for indul@@ gence .
I was different .
I seemed happy to be happy with this position and not to be ashamed .
these were just two mistakes ! &quot;
Prime Minister Weil wants to fast di@@ alling
CDU and F@@ DP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; precip@@ it@@ ational Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) is after the loss of red @-@ green government majority for a rapid re@@ election of the country , but he does not want . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because on Friday he spoke out for the dis@@ solution of the Parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot;
prior to that , the surprising leaving of a Green @-@ party in Lower Saxony had donated the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .
five months before the official date of the country code , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its scar@@ ce one @-@ vote majority in parliament to the opposition of CDU and F@@ DP .
the existing Green MP El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests in Germany founded their step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 election in their election circle in Rot@@ enburg ( W@@ ü@@ m@@ me ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CDU , &quot; she explained in Hanover on Friday .
S &amp; D Group President Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend her to record her .
thus the CDU and F@@ DP had 69 seats in the Lower Sax@@ on State Parliament , SPD and Green 68 seats .
so far , the relationship was inver@@ sely .
the new Parliament day will be elected regular on 14 January next year .
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said that the red @-@ green state government can decide whether they could gover@@ n in this situation without a majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stephan Weil , however , holds it indispensable that the country day as quickly resol@@ ves its self @-@ resolution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CDU faction is expected to decide on Tuesday on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the state constitution also sees the possibility that the Council &apos;s parliament draws the confidence and select a sequ@@ el . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; our constitution offers several options .
these options must be legally inspected , &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will discuss all questions in peace if they are legally examined . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called T@@ thwest ens step &quot; but something odd . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the polit@@ ician himself stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very good . &quot;
she described as a tra@@ ilers of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens demanded the de@@ pri@@ mer de@@ pu@@ ties for the return of their country track .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are of course anticip@@ ate that they have received their land workers on the green country list , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the presi@@ dents met@@ a Janssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Group &apos;s Group president Anja PI@@ EL said : &quot; we regre@@ t@@ ted the decision of El@@ ke T@@ ests . &quot;
it deliber@@ ately decided to lead no pron@@ unci@@ ation in the faction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even before the background that there was no substantial differences , we cannot understand this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the SPD chan@@ cell@@ or candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the accession of the Green M@@ EPs in Alsace to the CDU as a betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behaviour of the former Green M@@ EPs in Lower Saxony is not just betra@@ yal of the voters , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Committee of Socialists and Democrats on Friday on Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he support the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) to be rep@@ or@@ ated quickly .
the exit door is red @-@ green in Lower Saxony for the majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the polit@@ ician &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; political polit@@ ician &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her past el@@ it@@ el@@ ty and in her fru@@ stration , in front of the welfare of the country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Crit@@ eria Secretary @-@ General Hu@@ ber@@ tus &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a sc@@ andal that the CDU in Lower Saxony makes this dirty in@@ filtr@@ ation and tries to beat political capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dutch Prime Minister Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend to his representatives to record El@@ ke T@@ ests in the CDU .
the president of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , threw T@@ v@@ ests , with personal career thinking on the outcome of the 2013 country code .
the CDU was the strongest force in the SPD before the SPD : but the SPD and Green had a very thin majority in the country day .
Minister of Agriculture in the Interview - How do we protect us from Gif@@ ts , Herr Schmidt ?
Germany disc@@ usses di@@ abe@@ tic eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect consumers .
the Minister for Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is in an interview with the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer .
Mr Schmidt , How can consumers protect the consumer from pois@@ oned eggs ?
I can only encourage all consumers and consumers who closely watch the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp .
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ al@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the German states provide the latest information about the concerned eggs Char@@ gen .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if we know what we currently know , a health haz@@ ard is practically excluded .
now Al@@ di ass@@ umes the best possible crisis reaction - all the eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance of the Federal Minister is not really noticed ?
the food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless my house has immediately been shut down and since acquain@@ t@@ ance of Germany &apos;s sad@@ ness in close exchange with the authorities of the countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all information and risk assessment are available for consumers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trading has the same thing as the manufacturers to ensure that the sold @-@ selling products are per@@ tin@@ ent and health . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if at eggs of the resi@@ li@@ ent content of 0,@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg are exceeded , they are not per@@ ver@@ able .
un@@ loaded eggs can be sold and consumed .
this time the companies are not to blame .
are production companies and consumers in the same boat ?
after working conditions , production plants hits no immediate debt .
rather , they must count due to suspected illegal practices of services with economic damages .
as always , there is too little controllers in the harvest .
is it missing only on the staff or on the conclu@@ sive jurisdiction ?
they were just the official controls that have tried the process .
the truth , however , is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded to 100 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; precisely this is a consistent recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance of such events , and hand@@ over to the prosec@@ ut@@ ters in cases where criminal off@@ ences are possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have already made several times much that I expect a complete statement from the responsible authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
is regular alarm security really necessary in food sk@@ and@@ als ?
consumers and consumers have the right to get exclusively safe and per@@ tin@@ ent foods .
if a non @-@ legal insec@@ ti@@ ci@@ de is used in food industry , consumers and consumers are ri@@ ghtly ou@@ tra@@ ged .
by ar@@ ising means producer , dealer and consumer are advised in a situation that is absolutely not necessary .
basically it must be clear : the un@@ lawful use of insec@@ ti@@ ci@@ des fi@@ del@@ il in the position of food supplies are not acceptable and must be termin@@ ated immediately .
it has to be worked consistently and with high pressure on all levels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am expecting from all responsible authorities that the atomic fact is quick and complete . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how the Financial Rules of Le@@ ather on Ne@@ ym@@ ars move to Paris
the rules that aim to prevent un@@ hin@@ ted issues of European football clubs will not distur@@ b Ne@@ ym@@ ars world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain .
any consequences will be coming to Paris Saint @-@ Germain by the UEFA still , as the leading organization that monitors the European game has the power to offer teams of access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial Fair @-@ Play @-@ rules , which were sum@@ mon@@ ed by UEFA Europa , mean that PS@@ G has to point out sometime , that the transfer of Ne@@ ym@@ ar was financed without great losses .
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ( 262 million $ ) to buy the Brazilian from his contract , and Ne@@ ym@@ ar will receive a salary , which will amount to several ten million dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of Ne@@ ym@@ ars moving to France .
PS@@ G can easily make the money to loose the Ne@@ ym@@ ar and put it into a galaxy of other stars , in view of the financing of the team by the rich ruler of Qatar .
clubs may apply a lot of money for the purchase of players , but with legitim@@ ate sole sources , which enable them to break the break @-@ even point in their business on the football @-@ related business .
the FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEFA President in 2007 .
the former French player believed that clubs in their pursu@@ it had enormous debts to themselves , effectively frau@@ dul@@ ent and ris@@ ked to ruin , when banks or owners have returned their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from concentration to the debts of the clubs on the surveillance of their losses .
the change meant that the business model , the Roman Abr@@ am@@ ov@@ ich was initially used in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then power@@ fully invested to build the team and build a global brand - to become a harder matter .
during the current three @-@ year @-@ old FF@@ P period , which runs until 2018 , clubs may take losses of EUR 30 million .
and although Plat@@ ini fell from the Presi@@ dency of the Presi@@ dency in the Un@@ mer@@ ade , his UEFA @-@ successor Ale@@ ks@@ ander Ce@@ fi@@ in continues to put away from above expenses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surely , FF@@ P is not dead and we will definitely strengthen the rules for the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the FF@@ P , compared with The Associated Press last week . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the PS@@ G paid the buy @-@ out clau@@ se of Ne@@ ym@@ ar in a flat rate , it can distribute the amount for the invoice on the duration of his contract .
Ne@@ ym@@ ar has signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the solution for the next five years can be rejected in the amount of € 4@@ 4.4 million in the annual financial statements .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , hit the he@@ avi@@ est sanctions .
the PS@@ G received a fine of 60 million Euros ( 82 million dollars ) , which later was lowered to 20 million euros , and it was arranged that the championship @-@ members for the Champions League of season 2014 / 15 was limited to 21 players instead of otherwise normal 25 players remains limited .
the UEFA is looking for clubs , who could try to over@@ list their fiscal review by combining their revenues by companies which are bound up with the owners of a club .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a Hungarian company , the PS@@ G &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PS@@ G &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could not exceed the value of the sponsor@@ ship that should not exceed the standard market rates than legitim@@ ate revenues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
exactly this happened in 2014 when the UEFA ruled that the value of the sponsor@@ ship of the PSA funding from Qatar Tourism Authority was opened .
it was reported that a part of PS@@ G payments to Ne@@ ym@@ ar will take over payments from the organis@@ ational committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 have claimed that Ne@@ ym@@ ar &apos;s World Cup will be an ambassador for the UEFA Cup authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEFA Union is even more attentive to observe any attempt to handle the rules .
the UEFA had no prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G about Ne@@ ym@@ ars Transfer , announced on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .
they spoke under the condition of anon@@ ym@@ ity with The Associated Press , as they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the latest published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 generated a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of 54@@ 2.4 million euros .
the accounts for the last financial year must be published .
PS@@ G expects that Ne@@ ym@@ ars arrive a blessing for sponsor@@ ing @-@ de@@ als , merchan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ cot purchases .
the association goes out that sales after signature will rise by at least 30 percent .
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best soccer players , and she tried to prevent Ne@@ ym@@ ar directions by declar@@ ing that PS@@ G would viol@@ ate the FF@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a clear fall of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; financed D@@ oping &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the President of the European League , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS regarding Qatar &apos;s latter owner on PS@@ G . &quot; &quot; &quot;
arsen@@ al manager Arsen@@ e Wen@@ ger , whose association owned by an American sports ty@@ co@@ ons , shares La Liga &apos;s reservations against a state financed by an association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of the owner and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is very difficult to respect the financial fair Fair@@ play because you can have different ways or have different interests , if a country has such a great actor to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss is searching for a new S@@ og@@ gi@@ ants
in the past years , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y has produced Fre@@ y aboard chocolate for the Swiss .
now the whole cooperation exists before a possible end : the airline rep@@ or@@ ates the order .
Swiss spokesperson Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ p confirmed on request of the news agency S@@ DA , according to the news agency &quot; Nord@@ west@@ ern@@ z &quot; from Friday .
according to current planning , the airline will close a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products would test every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; we are very satisfied with the current supplier of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; said the spokesperson .
approximately 17 million small red @-@ white sh@@ og@@ g@@ ages spread over 14 grams a year , per year , the flight guide before landing to the passengers .
the Swiss wanted no information about the cost .
&quot; &quot; &quot; industry @-@ sider appreciate the order volume according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; North @-@ West Switzerland &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to 1.5 @-@ 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of around one billion Swiss francs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but more important is the advertising effect : for a ch@@ og@@ gi@@ ate producer , it is a prestigious order .
as many applicants are there with the new call , the Swiss will not want to betra@@ y .
but in question only Swiss manufacturers are coming .
according to the newspaper report , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to try to make a renewal of the contract beyond the spring 2018 .
the largest Swiss chocolate producer has not been achie@@ vable for the S@@ DA .
chocolate bars have been distributed to the Swiss since 2006 on board their flights .
before the Swiss concluded a contract with Mig@@ ros daughter , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut has built the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hu@@ g .
the opportunity to place the logo was introduced two and a half years ago with the start of cooperation with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline operates with various Swiss chocolate producers .
in long @-@ distance trips , customers of First Class with treats will be spoiled by the Con@@ fis@@ erie Spr@@ ün@@ gli , in Business Class n@@ ags behind Lind@@ t and Economy Class Sch@@ og@@ gi von Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .

nost@@ algia starts in &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
&quot; &quot; &quot; this repet@@ ition of history is nost@@ al@@ gic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The State &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the 90 &apos;s years , and for himself - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , like Elizabeth B@@ anks , Amy Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Rud@@ d went to bigger things . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a cultural ar@@ te@@ fact it is equally a par@@ ody and em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era .
but as a fran@@ chise it feels like the time would be scar@@ ce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; First Day of Camp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; didn &apos;t work surprisingly well , not just because of his sur@@ sur@@ fer hum@@ our ( it contained an original story for a speaking box vegetable which was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by ti@@ ghtening them on the core of the G@@ ags - Ac@@ tor middle age play@@ es children who grow up - they still create the im@@ possibility to gain the last part of the W@@ itz@@ es back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with his adults who now play adults is less emotional and his par@@ ody goes more after the wat@@ ering principle , among them a reef on the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 &apos;s as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the Cra@@ dle &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Hand That Th@@ inking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at one point , a character is chann@@ eled through an Apple Power@@ book , some in@@ line skating , and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a series of other things from 1991 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the lovely C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now Roman@@ aut@@ or , has not yet forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ite Mo@@ reau ) .
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has still not lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there is another crazy evil @-@ evil plot where Ronald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) is included , which is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
as always , the courses are the best part of the fran@@ chise .
it makes a lot of fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Rud@@ d , the Matt D@@ alli@@ on sub@@ li@@ pp@@ le of &quot; Singles &quot; shows the former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy now feels like an old kno@@ cker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are the moments of acci@@ dental mad@@ ness that could heat this fran@@ chise as a kind of repe@@ ating &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until he achieved what I will show as his logical conclusion : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whose last scene will show the band &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon reminds me of another type of nost@@ algia : to the revival of the Cold War of &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even to &quot; G@@ low &quot; with its East @-@ against @-@ West Ring @-@ I@@ con@@ ography .
the com@@ edy filmed by Brian G@@ ate@@ wood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka with R@@ hy@@ s Thomas , a Romanian drama of eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Bucharest , who are fighting for truth , a@@ the@@ ism , and the way of Marx@@ ism Len@@ in@@ ism .
the main roles - a hard soci@@ ot@@ ten@@ er Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i , whose dial@@ ogues from Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a detailed producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt played in English .
it is a brilliant idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice souven@@ irs to look ( the police spend time to watch chess on TV , as Americans may do with football ) .
and the list of famous actors - including Jenny S@@ late , Nick Op@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Chlo@@ e Sev@@ ign@@ y - provides a decent game &apos; Find out the voice &apos; .
but Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; is involved so much for the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desper@@ ate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer , who carries a Re@@ agan @-@ mask , is getting it often like a single agan .
with six long episodes , the com@@ edy is getting closer and the com@@ edy is not fast or frequently enough .
&quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; that was re@@ dig@@ ged on a lower length might be better to visit his Ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p @-@ Sati@@ re , da Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef ever visited the American Embassy , which always occupies a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers .
the Embassy of the Imag@@ inary Commun@@ ists is that western culture can make everything to feed for a gel .
the fic@@ tive Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even make it with our own younger history and the ih@@ ap .
strike against drug m@@ af@@ ia in the country
the police is a blow against the Italian Mafia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning in the Black Forest B@@ aar @-@ district , in Rot@@ tw@@ eil , Konstan@@ z , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart visited numerous objects as the public prosec@@ utor was shared on Friday .
15 of them were arrested in the age of 25 and 77 years , and already arrest warran@@ ts against them .
they also placed bigger amounts of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms , and several hundred thousand Euros safe .
two persons were arrested during the same raid in Italy .
there were German arrest warran@@ ts against the two susp@@ ects .
the two will therefore be shipped to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved in the action .
a total of over 300 polic@@ emen were in use .
the members of the Mafia was organised by drug criminal , violent acts of violence , attempted murder and rob@@ ber@@ y .
in the summer of 2016 , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s public prosec@@ utor was established against organised drug traff@@ icking in southern Germany .
between the prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Konstan@@ z and Palermo , a real exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ tw@@ eil had almost daily contacts with their colleagues in Sicily .
the big effort was also accompanied by four officers from Palermo on Wednesday morning .
the outcome of the investigations were mainly Italian nationals with regard to the Italian m@@ af@@ ia .
an incident occurred on 27 May in hips , at which early in the morning several shots were fired in a restaurant , might go to the bank@@ roll &apos;s account .
fashion su@@ cks big g@@ aps in the fore@@ ig@@ ner register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data of citizens who should not appear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : according to a report , the foreigners register in Germany has significant defects . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that lead to partly serious mis@@ concep@@ tions in asylum procedures .
according to the Federal Government of the Federal Government of the Federal Government of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , according to a media report , according to large g@@ aps , is alert to large g@@ aps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; def@@ ici@@ encies in the there registered data could lead to asylum procedures and dep@@ ort@@ ations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; subject to engraved mal@@ end@@ ings &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; warned in an analysis described in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the regist@@ ers , ten million people with foreign citizenship , including approximately 5.7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
the data is therefore managed by approximately 600 federal authorities in Germany .
because the data has not been maintained sufficiently , the data quality has not been good in parts so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in some cases , data from 1921 has been found , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Of men who are long since no longer in life , or citizens who have become German citizens and not to emerge in the register . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bad data sets can considerably slow recur@@ ring processes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it to the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the statistics on out@@ going trav@@ eler people , EU citizens are covered that would not have to travel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such false orders &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; led to a dis@@ gr@@ ated debate on the handling of trav@@ eler people &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says it in the analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the Federal Government has obviously begun to return to Italy with 16 @-@ year @-@ old children back to Italy when they came from there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this goes out from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BAM@@ F ) reports the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Neue Osnab@@ ru@@ cker Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the paper , BAM@@ F do such procedures &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regarding families with children - except for infants and small children - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the end of 2014 it was practically no longer possible , so the newspaper had a link to the difficult situation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Dublin agreement , the EU State is responsible for refugees to reach it first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a mig@@ rant travels across another EU country , this state can send him back to immigration .
to justify the office : &quot; meanwhile , the admission capacity for families with children in Italy has increased significantly . &quot;
Italy have given guarantees for the recording and accommodation of families .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) hold these additions for sufficient .
other EU countries would also send refugees to the Dublin Agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the internal policy spokes@@ woman in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ized this decision : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; families with children above the lack of the Italian Asyl@@ um System and a endanger@@ ing of child sound . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
second best result achieved
a total of 220 litres of blood of people living in Ober@@ reich@@ enbach was already available to other people &apos;s ende@@ av@@ ors .
at least from the twelve citizens , which were awarded on Friday .
all of Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who now distributed 100 litres of blood with its meanwhile 100 don@@ ates .
traditionally , the community has neglec@@ ted multiple will@@ ingness to don@@ ate blood in the meeting of the council .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is awesome as our body is laid out and we are missing the don@@ ors who make their blood for strangers , nor for an un@@ sel@@ fish &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under@@ lined mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a single blood donation helps several people &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German Red Cross &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , because the preserved foods are de@@ composed into their components . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three people could benefit from a blood@@ stream .
at the same time , maize enb@@ acher reported about the actions which will be held in the spring in Ober@@ reich@@ enbach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year we achieved the second best result with 114 contri@@ butors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DR@@ K &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Manager &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously , the change to the theatre house had led to higher levels of participants only a few years ago .
before it was already counting Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Meta w@@ berry to the multiple accounts and were awarded for each 50 % blood donations .
half as many book Herbert M@@ air and Dor@@ othe@@ e Rie@@ x@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Bo@@ ro@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stef@@ anie St@@ oll and Uwe V@@ etter spent ten times a 500 milli@@ litre of her life juice .
the Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
Bank of England is likely to announce that interest rates remain unchanged , after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation have sub@@ du@@ ed the spec@@ ulation over an increase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England has warned that economic growth will &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; remain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it retained a interest rate in the middle of a reinforced pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bank &apos;s political decision @-@ makers ( M@@ PC ) agreed with 6 to 2 to keep interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , whereby the weak economic growth has weak@@ ened support for increasing growth in this month .
in its quar@@ terly annual report , the Bank reduced its growth progn@@ osis for 2017 to 1.7 % and for 2018 on 1.6 % and warned that inflation would rise to just under 3 % in the fall .
but they believe that in the next few years , Zin@@ c would be needed to bre@@ ach the inflation of Bre@@ xit and she said that credit cost may need to rise more than expected in financial markets .
the members also voted to withdraw a part of Mamm@@ ut @-@ economic Pak@@ ets , which was published one year after the Bre@@ xit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will require time to deplo@@ y budget funds for banks in order to deplo@@ y cheap financial resources for banks , although it is expected that it is expected to provide 15 billion pounds worth more within the framework of this system - with 115 billions of pound ster@@ ling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; minutes after the decision on the interest rate the Bank said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the central forecast of the M@@ PC , gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak , because the pressure on the real income of households continues to be charged consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; to the interest rates , she repeated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a certain stra@@ pping of monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for cooling down inflation and a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bit larger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be needed than the markets expect . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the markets currently forecast the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
the Bank , however , stressed that increases &quot; gradually &quot; and &quot; limited . &quot;
the Bank forecast following down@@ wards corrected the Bank for this and next year confirms 1.9 % and 1.7 % compared to the forecast in May .
it maintained its growth forecast for 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound dropped after these news from the dollar and the euro .
the pound dropped from 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 Euro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision to no change occur after the recent disappoin@@ ting growth figures to reduce the rising expectations on a Zin@@ c level and increased GDP in the second quarter of 0.2 % in the previous three months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it is easy to recover from the end of the year .
the most recent inflation forecast offered little enthusiasm for households that are affected by an increasing inflation and minor salary increase , as the exac@@ erb@@ ation becomes even worse , before they become better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that the monetary policy cannot &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the next few years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but she added that the wages become &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the end of their three @-@ year forecast . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods , which is attri@@ but@@ able to weak pounds , which will compens@@ ate for a proportion of lower consumer spending .
the decision comes a year following the lower@@ ing of interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % in August following the sho@@ cking EU vote , which caused the sin@@ king of the god@@ mother .
the Bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will fully reach the prices and the economy .
before the Bank &apos;s final judgment , the call was increased after a Zin@@ c increase , because inflation increased pressure on hard displac@@ ed budgets , with three political decision makers in July required a rise to 0.5 % .
inflation has dropped from 2.9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the bank said that this was expected to be put again in the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said that the excess of 2 % is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the weak pounds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Andrew Mont@@ lake , director at Co@@ rec@@ o mort@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the recent feedback of the s@@ wap rate , the mort@@ gage market is likely to be competitive again as the l@@ res@@ eller is looking for shops and want to finish this year in a positive way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the market looks particularly good for those who run the existing de@@ als and fin@@ alize the new mort@@ g@@ ages , and many with free options and low rates are becoming popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) aims to rub a controversial HIV drug of 10,000 people
&quot; &quot; &quot; patients will receive an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transformed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; HIV pre@@ ventive treatment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in September following a fight against the drug in N@@ HS . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ HS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ HS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said England that a pre @-@ risk pre@@ valent phy@@ to@@ xe ( Pr@@ EP ) , which can reduce the risk of infections at risk @-@ risk substances by around 86 percent , now is estimated to be supplied by a first three @-@ year study for an estimated 10,000 people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was willing to finance the trial , after the Appeals Court uph@@ eld the decision of the Supreme Court of Justice under what the N@@ HS had to pay for the Pr@@ EP despite the asser@@ tion that the local authorities should finance him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Schach@@ suit announced on Thursday was greeted by N@@ HS England chief Simon Stev@@ ens as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; important new intervention &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; during the National Aids Trust ( NAT ) described this as a &quot; crucial moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ ghton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be the first to follow the registration of people , and other clinics will follow in October 2018 in the whole of England .
pre@@ ference methods ( Pr@@ EP ) is a result of HIV drug , which are taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that Pr@@ EP significantly reduces HIV transmission in infection areas .
pr@@ EP in front of sexual intercourse means that just enough medicines are present in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection .
such medications may be taken every day or so two hours before sexual intercourse .
for those who come to question , are gay or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , trans@@ sexual and persons with HIV @-@ positive partners that were not successfully treated .
in clinics , suitable participants are identified to agree with the study including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner , whose HIV @-@ status is not known to be anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy .
people who live in England and registered with a family doctor may also register for a possible participation in their local medical clinic .
the programme will be £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract for delivery of medications in this week following an international competitive proc@@ urement .
the study aims to assess the entire potential of Pr@@ EP by clinical evidence as it is used in large scale and implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Stev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should complement and over@@ take positive efforts to prevention of HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in the more than three decades of continued progress in managing one of the greatest health challenges of humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Deborah Gold , Chief Executive at NAT ( National Aids Trust ) , said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ EP , if it is targeted specifically to need and endangered people , offers the possibility to change the English HIV virus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in September , people will have access to the N@@ HS @-@ funded attempt to develop a new instrument , which is truly individually controlled and is not subject to a negoti@@ ation with a partner , which leads to the improvement of many many lives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ian Green , CEO of the Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the priority now needs to be done quickly throughout the country and that no one has left the risk for HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; now , since the Pr@@ EP test@@ is has been created , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ infected people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sharon Hodg@@ son , shadow of Health , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the start of the Pr@@ EP process is welcome after months of delay and re@@ lu@@ ct@@ ant implementation by the government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug may be part of our approach to HIV @-@ prevention and can end the transfer of this li@@ vable infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to the understanding of the benefits of Pr@@ EP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is important that this study will be carried out as quickly as possible in order to protect people who are infected with HIV , and that it will contribute to the end of the prolifer@@ ation of HIV in society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
live Life : mezz@@ anine and smart designers tricks have transformed this little Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a generous home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , resi@@ zed 2014 from a large house in Kn@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge to Ear@@ ls Court Apartment .
it is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it &apos;s a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not seized and sold their bags .
&quot; I lived with my ex in Kn@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger space , &quot; says Jo@@ anne .
&quot; I searched after something that was comparable to my price .
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and she had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I fell in love with her and made an offer on that day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot has been over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ room property with an extravag@@ ant layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Jo@@ anne &apos;s storage room and a mezz@@ anine to provide optimal ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light .
that was my request , &quot; she says .
for this purpose she commissioned the architecture and design studio Duck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Notting Hill to make 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home , which was not only a development but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms , so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezz@@ anine in which you could stand .
Er@@ fan had to be creative in order to rede@@ em the awar@@ ding .
&quot; the steel work is quite complicated , &quot; he explains .
&quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were over@@ st@@ acked , without having to g@@ aps ourselves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it wasn &apos;t just about building a single platform , but to make the steel that it had the right height for the position above or below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan to place two rooms in full height - with lots of additional drama .
for the mezz@@ anine there is a classic copper light window by Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us down the glam@@ orous living area .
mir@@ ro@@ red gold furniture , silver acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille Lighting set the style for the program .
the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light .
on both ends a short corridor is mir@@ ro@@ red to leave him for longer .
in the kitchen the mirror feels like a window in another room .
at the entrance , mir@@ ro@@ red units offer space for all seating and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
through the perception of a glam@@ orous space , the beauty of the living room can lock the kitchen if it is not used .
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of engineering went in , &quot; explains Er@@ fan of steel reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF @-@ door .
&quot; it is mutual , so it is when you push the door , very easily gli@@ des . &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage , Jo@@ anne was able to win extra 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; at the end of the day , you will sell the land area - or how your property is estimated , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form a real estate agent will occur and make a calculation based on ground size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here , they have managed to enlarge the floor space , and at the same time use high @-@ quality materials that provide space to the luxurious benefits .
&quot; the materials are things you touch , and therefore help to create an emotional connection in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; you don &apos;t forget to the electrical outlets in the walls .
these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square meter of somewhat standard into something quite amazing .
in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave them .
brothers fight for a 500 million US dollar in real estate
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in an argument about one of the largest real estate , Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as worth over $ 500 million .
the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton Football Club &apos; and developers Colin De Lut@@ is lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , just three doors from his younger brother Paul . he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clari@@ fy how their property and their business can be split .
Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 , but a sharp analysis about the separation takes place in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers share 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , accumulated since the family purchased a business in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood .
there the West@@ co Je@@ ans family and grew up to a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars .
this money was invested in real estate and the portfolio of De Lut@@ is now includes offices in the city rum , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping m@@ alls in the subur@@ b .
after an agreement with her late father Colin - Paul is described as &quot; the chief operator and the dominant personality &quot; at the family De Lut@@ is - about two thirds of the company &apos;s desire and Paul is about a third .
a place of jurisdiction shows that Colin Property has worth EUR 316 million and is valued at a value of 176 million dollars .
the division of real estate and cash was proven to Paul as a problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the not@@ if@@ ications of Colin proposed calls on him left what I kept for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in the first aff@@ id@@ av@@ it in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice took place on Friday last Friday .
the brothers also strug@@ gling to control over the existing business - of what Colin , as Paul claims to be excluded .
Colin argu@@ ed , this is not true , but raises Paul before , to manage some owners in@@ competent .
in an early affair that was handed in Colin Colin , he says he was hoping to settle the dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Italian heir suggests that the family is the most important priority , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
costs rise in the case , with hundreds of sites with aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , emails and reports of companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and from both sides held in the bar .
Mrs. De Lut@@ is and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants , the dairy bars and del@@ icacy from the late 1950 @-@ s and bought a business in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early se@@ ven@@ ties .
you use the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property , in Colin Colin the first je@@ wish shop of the family opened .
Colin says that he began West@@ co there when he was &quot; in my last years &quot; high school , when Paul was still a small child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De Lut@@ is says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , trusted their property to their sons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted to land the brothers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lut@@ is group , with Colin argu@@ ing that Mark had paid 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark are , Paul &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Paul &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the conditions of their financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Colin has kept back very well , although he was a former AF@@ L board member and following a biography from 2015 by Eddie Mc@@ Gu@@ ire the best friend of the TV stars .
Fair@@ fax Media took contact with Colin and Paul De Lut@@ is and their lawyers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only Colin answered by SMS to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really can &apos;t say much &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the case is before the courts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very sad that my brother Paul has decided to su@@ e me and draw our sur@@ name through the courts &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 Colin wrote in writing to the court that he tried to fulfill the demands of his brother .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and I would end up in our current dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , and added that he was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hope for a solution &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday , these hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our business will be solved in the near future of the courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Colin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ um@@ ps of Chief of Staff plans to limit media abst@@ in@@ ence of the President .
others have tried it and have failed .
perhaps John F. Kelly can do it .
if so , he will be the first .
POL@@ IT@@ ICO reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to limit information flow to President Tr@@ ump - including reports of news media - in hope to keep the boss on a uniform course .
here is a piece of rep@@ orter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , he sent a major problem to President Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps White House , which he wanted to repair : bad information that arrives in the hands of the President . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow , whether on paper or in letters - because the president would make better decisions if he would get good information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others tried to t@@ ame tr@@ ump by monitor his media law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Tr@@ um@@ ps relationship to television goes back for decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his television is still strong . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when candidate Tr@@ ump was angry because of an un@@ fair coverage , it was productive to show him that he received a fair coverage of places , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the former election campaign Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February opposite POL@@ IT@@ ICO . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Polit@@ ic@@ os Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote to the time that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the key to keep Tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter hab@@ it under control , according to six former election campaign officials to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a constant praise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
okay .
but the idea that tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter hab@@ it ever &quot; under control &quot; was ridi@@ culous .
perhaps these struggle officials don &apos;t know what we don &apos;t know - that Tr@@ um@@ ps twe@@ ets would have provided more combust@@ ible without their inter@@ ventions .
we will probably never know something about the twe@@ ets that has not sent tr@@ ump .
when his employees were able to keep him away from him , their efforts have paid off their efforts .
but no one has consistently been able to prevent tr@@ ump of contro@@ vers@@ y .
a part of the problem exists that people in a White House killing themselves from competing parties , always try to present their own agenda by promoting Tr@@ ump material , which may promote their views from the world .
POL@@ IT@@ ICO -@@ which deals with this story - reported in May on the pre@@ ference of the consultants , President of strategic reasons doub@@ tful information .
this was an example described by rep@@ orter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current and former tr@@ ump officials say that tr@@ ump can react as a volcano on negative press cuts , especially those with damaged le@@ aks , and that he is sti@@ ff@@ ened to find out where these originate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; exactly this happened at the end of February when someone accused a printed copy of an article from Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet provo@@ cation Charles C. Johnson , who accused the Deputy Chief of K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be the source behind a pile to be of le@@ aks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the White House . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Johnson was ban@@ ished because of ch@@ ic@@ ans permanently from Twitter or that he had no concrete evidence , or that he expressed false pre@@ judi@@ ces and mis@@ sil@@ enced them in the past .
Tr@@ ump read the article and began to ask staff about Wal@@ sh . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gold@@ macher added that the former staff of Chief Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Rob Por@@ ter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tried to implement a system to administ@@ er and document the tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how did it work ?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later .
perhaps he will prove itself as an effective manager as Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his impul@@ sive self , and his coun@@ sel@@ ors still stri@@ ve to influence .
these un@@ changing factors make the Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
most sought crimin@@ als get mail from Europ@@ ol
as the address is unknown , the help of the population will pray and hop@@ ed .
the police scattered all over Europe in this summer ( virtual ) postcards on the dangerous crimin@@ als on the run .
as the addresses of the sought @-@ in crimin@@ als are un@@ aware of , evidence from the population are hoping to pray and pray .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Europ@@ ol reported on Friday from the action published on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU Most Wan@@ ted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Advent calendar from the winter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the experiences had shown that many whis@@ pers hide from holiday stations , called it by Europ@@ ol .
you have compiled 21 postcards for selected crimin@@ als from 21 EU countries .
since 2016 , it has been viewed the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ ok , more than 2.5 million times .
36 of the online songs could have been arrested so far , at least eleven of them based on the publication on the website .
trav@@ ellers negoti@@ ate over a dit@@ ch and return back to the &apos; million@@ aires series &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands are back with some resol@@ ute trav@@ ellers on war@@ ef@@ oot that have drawn away an area in front of its manor buildings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the trav@@ ellers have par@@ ked their 20 caravan on a field outside a wealthy road of Soli@@ hull , which is called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; million@@ aires series . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they have brought horses , babies and an army of transport , after being thrown out in May , without being thrown out by a gra@@ dient from the Council to prevent their fail@@ ures .
the tac@@ tile group found a gap in def@@ enses , and pressed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; angry residents have pushed the Council of Soli@@ hull , who said it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; an anonymous resident said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were moved there on Monday evening after being sent from Bentley He@@ ath where they have thrown stones to the pass@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council must be forced by switching to the implementation in fact as it was useless when handling the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the trav@@ ellers were there in May , moved on and are now back again .
more came to last night , probably even more . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to keep track by holding long subtitles to protect their parks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am living along Stre@@ et@@ s@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to keep my comm@@ uting if the Council cannot stop this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a local residents who didn &apos;t want to be called , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It is ridi@@ culous , we have just seen the last round of these travelers to be lo@@ oted only by another round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the numbers have increased this time and you even have seen a horse in the park area . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a speaker in the Council of Soli@@ hull said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the land beyond Stre@@ et@@ s@@ brook Road and work together with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps to carry them on as soon as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to support our evidence , it is very important that as many residents make an anti @-@ social and criminal behavior in the police by calling on 101 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must check when we submit our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
bir@@ ch bir@@ ch is Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former Hotel Birken@@ hof , the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is located .
the house in front of the gates of Freud &apos;s neighborhood is currently being renovated and will be re@@ opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closure of the Birken@@ hof , by the former ambient company , mbH to 13 April 2014 , some 30 000 overnight stays were lost per year , and also revenue by local tax .
in the fall of 2014 , the property was offered to dramatically rising numbers of refugees who visited the District Council as a collective housing , which provided controversial discussions for controversial discussions .
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seek@@ ers through the establishment of a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not disp@@ uted in the municipal council .
but especially Freud &apos;s mayor Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious interested parties in the house .
he should keep right .
the Lu@@ isen@@ yi Group CEO , with headquarters in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern , has acquired the former Hotel Birken@@ hof in a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it back to a house of the three @-@ star Plus Category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ städ@@ ter object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
you are called Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the former Hotel Birken@@ hof have been building blocks before the entrance , and when you enter the house , the vast renovation work will be made .
the so@@ ils were removed out , ceilings for part degra@@ ded , old swi@@ m@@ wear from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
there is much to do until March .
&quot; it is actually a beautiful hotel , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our Newspaper .
everything should be renewed in the Black Forest .
the rooms are equipped with large @-@ walk showers , the input area is re@@ designed , new windows are installed .
everything should be &quot; beautifully formed &quot; , as Thomas Sch@@ erer presses .
&quot; we want to make a gem . &quot;
swimming pool , spa area and a meeting room belong to the decor .
you don &apos;t want to position themselves at the high level of hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on a high @-@ level city level , emphas@@ izes Sch@@ erer .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise , with its approximately 60 rooms , wants to rise wide , explains Sch@@ erer further .
either individual holiday , groups or business people should feel comfortable in the hotel .
he already managed talks with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and Tourism director Michael K@@ rau@@ se , so Sch@@ erer .
the performances of the city are identical with those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
after the height of investment , Thomas Sch@@ erer does not want to set out exactly .
scar@@ ce under one million euros , he reck@@ ons .
the outside systems are also brought up on the front , that is clearly visible .
in a courtyard there is a large terrace which is open from the restaurant that is public .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimistic : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Russia Aff@@ air : us Special Agent sets Grand Jury
in the Russian affair around US President Donald Tr@@ ump , Robert Mu@@ eller is supposed to have employed a so @-@ called Grand Jury according to a report .
the Panel started working in the past weeks , writing the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; on appeal with trusted people .
the paper value the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller has expanded and intensi@@ fied its investigations .
the radio station CNN reported that there is already the first inv@@ it@@ ations of the body in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ um@@ ps el@@ dest son and a Russian lawyer .
us intelligence services accused the Kre@@ m@@ lin to have purpos@@ ed in the presidential election campaign in 2016 .
Mu@@ eller is investig@@ ating whether there were agreements between tr@@ um@@ ps campaigns team and Moscow .
the investigations have several men who are in the election campaign as a consultant of the rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
according to reports , Mu@@ eller took more and more tr@@ um@@ ps private and business environment under the micro@@ scope .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the agent Tr@@ ump had personally moved into the center and investig@@ ate the accus@@ ation whether the president may imp@@ aired the courts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; affair &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main task of Grand Y@@ ear@@ ys is to prove present evidence in possible case cases and decide whether the charge is to be charged .
Grand y@@ ur@@ ys are therefore also called one of the prisoners .
they are switched on when it is bigger and controversial cases .
the procedure is always closed behind closed doors .
the Panel may also be turned on by the public prosec@@ utor to serve people for the business of E@@ id .
according to CNN CNN , pre @-@ inv@@ it@@ ations have already been issued to turn around the encounter between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
people who were involved in the meeting were sum@@ mon@@ ed to a statement , named it in the report .
they should also provide documents .
apart from Tr@@ ump J@@ r. there were also Tr@@ um@@ ps advis@@ er and son @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner and his assistant director Paul Man@@ a@@ fort with his interview .
right @-@ wing experts said on Thursday evening in US television that the en@@ forcement is showing that Mu@@ eller is not in@@ ti@@ mi@@ dated in his work and that he should be necessary if necessary , act quickly .
however , it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be on the end to decide on the collection of a charge .
however , the implementation of the body is the start of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for President Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the midst of the new revel@@ ations , the President on Thursday evening used a speech in West Virginia to portra@@ y the Russia @-@ Aff@@ air as a campaign of its political opponents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Russia history is a total invention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the theme give the Democrats a way to feel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good to feel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because they have nothing else to talk about that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his special advisor T@@ y Cob@@ b explained in an opinion he doesn &apos;t know anything about the composition of a Grand Jury .
but they usually work in the sal@@ ms , he stressed .
the White House endor@@ se all measures that accelerated the work of the special medi@@ ation to &quot; f@@ aire &quot; way .
former FBI chief James Com@@ ey said three times that I won &apos;t be determined against President .
you have no reason to assume that something has changed , it continued in the explanation .
only Mu@@ eller had only been used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired .
because of this trou@@ gh , accus@@ ations had become loud against tr@@ ump , who want to im@@ pe@@ de the judi@@ ci@@ ary .
Com@@ ey said in June before a Senate committee , Tr@@ ump was asked for a setting of investigation against the then national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ ynn .
the President is under enormous pressure because of the study .
according to the representation of US media , the White House collected material against the medi@@ ator and its employees .
the dis@@ b@@ anded spec@@ ulation about that tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller is released .
unlike a independent special agent of the Congress , such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair , in order to return to President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has fired a position in which he might be fired on insist@@ ence of the president of the Ministry of Justice .
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
two groups of rep@@ ubli@@ can and democratic sen@@ ators on Thursday release bills , after which the special requests could no longer be dismissed so easily .
Antarc@@ tica : gigantic Eis@@ berg drives in Antarc@@ tica
in the West@@ ant@@ arc@@ tic , a gigantic Eis@@ berg has split from the scar@@ ring of the Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is by the almost seven @-@ fold size of Berlin .
he shared the Bremer@@ haven Alfred @-@ We@@ gener @-@ Institut for Polar@@ - and Marine Research on Wednesday .
they now drive over a tr@@ illion tons of heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometers . now drive north@@ wards and will probably take two , three years until he was melted .
it is 175 kilometers of length and a width of up to 50 kilometers of one of the largest polar varieties , researchers have registered in the last three decades .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no danger to people from him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to what extent climate change has played a role in the departure of the ice@@ berg , research data is un@@ clear .
but overall , there has been a series of unusual inter@@ bur@@ sts in the region around 30 years , writes the US research center for snow and ice ( NS@@ IDC ) in a fact background .
according to many researchers , it could be related to global warming .
now , the broken clip was a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is .
Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is flo@@ ats on the sea and is fed by big gl@@ ac@@ iers .
so it continues to grow in the sea and breaks off regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is located south of South America almost at the top of the ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula .
North of this Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ west was the equi@@ libri@@ um of wa@@ xes and dis@@ rup@@ ting several years ago .
a complete Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is was broken there , writes AW@@ I researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen .
there is some evidence that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is in danger , because the front edge had never with@@ drawn so far as currently .
furthermore , the ice plate stand under voltage and can be broken , if at a key passage , a piece ab@@ bre@@ ach .
the melting of Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is and Eis@@ berg will not increase sea level , as they float on the water and ur@@ ges with ice as much water as it yields .
however , the loss of the ling@@ ering leads to the gl@@ ac@@ iers directly into the sea and can drain much faster than before .
this could possibly increase sea level , but only in a small degree , writes the British research project on the observation of the Antarc@@ tic ( Mi@@ das ) .
according to AW@@ I , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is the four @-@ largest Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is of Antarc@@ tica with nearly 50 000 square kilometres .
at the crossing of mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , the front edge to the free ocean is approximately 200 metres .
there it breaks regularly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although it is a natural gift , and we do not realize any direct connection to climate change , the ice sign is now in a dangerous position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ Le@@ ary from the British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is the longest retreat since the beginning of records , &quot; he confirmed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; scientists are argu@@ ing whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is will now grow back or long @-@ term , his colleague Adrian Luck@@ man and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this development will last decades .
although these researchers did not return the erup@@ tion of this gigantic ice@@ berg to climate change , so in recent decades the ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula can be disin@@ te@@ gr@@ ated .
this long zi@@ pper of Antarc@@ tica goes towards South America .
after the research programme of British Antarc@@ tic Survey , the ice surface of the Antarc@@ tic Peninsula has decreased by 28 000 square kilometers since the 1950s .
the rise has contributed to the decrease .
the Antarc@@ tic Peninsula was heated by around three degrees in the past 50 years and counting the territ@@ ories in which the temperature is fastest .
the CDU wants to get away from the staff
because it is becoming more difficult to occupy vac@@ ancies , the CDU , from the working association demands more attractive to become more attractive .
only shortly before the summer break the Kre@@ ist@@ ag has cut 41 new jobs in the administration .
more than 1100 employees and officers are working for the administration management in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 trainees have left their first working day .
the teachers at the circle are obviously very cov@@ eted .
some 620 applications were reported to be recorded in this year .
nevertheless , the circle is still lacking staff to cope with the increased demands and tasks .
at the moment , there are currently 50 vac@@ ant positions at the M@@ ett@@ mann district .
among other things , doctors and engineers , as well as the forces of general administration are searched .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CDU would like to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and U@@ WG to take the initiative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the administration &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the parties , management should work as a concept for recru@@ it@@ ment and personnel development . &quot;
the aim is to cover not only short @-@ term conditions , but it is future oriented towards applicants .
the overall concept should be oriented towards the inside and extern@@ ally , concrete measures for trans@@ lat@@ ors and a training offensive include the CDU , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
it sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with a personal problems , which one had not known earlier .
other cities advert@@ ise well officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is from a real &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition of public employers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to this end , a high number of employees will ex@@ crete disease or age due to the service .
the highest time to act so that not even more places remain un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter Peop@@ les , leader of the CDU , goes beyond the joint motion with his party .
he was already in the Kre@@ ist@@ ag for a f@@ uss @-@ thick surprise when he publicly put the personnel cover publicly in question and the other parties flour@@ ished .
nations would like to be checked out that all possibilities will allow an exit from the municipal labor association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we don &apos;t come to a satisfactory solution here , the administration management should aim with trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the county @-@ affiliated towns - a pet tari@@ ff . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus the CDU , employees and officials are trying to pay better than it is actually looking for tari@@ ff of public service .
the sal@@ aries are currently precisely prescribed , enh@@ ancements or more money , only when you change to a higher level , orient@@ ates itself to professional years .
but the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years .
only a few weeks ago , new spaces had to be established , in which employees take care of the provisions of the new prost@@ itute .
not least by the increasing number of asylum seek@@ ers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ director Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy shar@@ pen@@ ed the tone to NGO @-@ Mig@@ rants
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has warned that life @-@ boats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they are not allowed to continue to keep new rules for their operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if NGOs send no new code of code , it is difficult to see how they can continue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Interior Minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ ampa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Minn@@ itis was a day after the Italian authorities had conf@@ is@@ cated a boat from the German aid organisation &apos; youth Ret@@ tet &apos; because their crew had effectively worked with human traff@@ ickers in a fashion that was lighten@@ ed illegal immigration .
the relief organisation , which has only been in operation since a year , refused to express his accus@@ ations by the Italian prosec@@ utor Amb@@ ro@@ gio Cart@@ osi@@ o .
&quot; for us , the rescue of human life remains our top priority . so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone , &quot; said the organisation in a position among the social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can assess all the accus@@ ations that are currently collected , only after we collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had the boat from &apos; youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , super@@ vised since October .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is assumed that its occupation of ding@@ h@@ y migrants are being delivered , which can be delivered directly from traff@@ ickers that can drive them directly from human traff@@ ickers so that the s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can be used , so that ships can be used again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least one such co@@ incidence took place only 1.3 miles before the Libyan coast , according to the acts of the Prosecutor , whose content was published by Italian media .
the occupation becomes suspic@@ ious , on the authority of the Italian coast@@ guards to super@@ impos@@ e life forces in the zone of humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives .
under the code of conduct , boats like the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a must mainly have an Italian police officers who monitors its activities .
only three of the nine NGOs who are involved in search and rescue operations have so far been declared to keep their code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be need@@ less but acceptable , as they would not bring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fundamental changes or disabilities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of their rescue actions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among those who refused to sign , the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate organisation physi@@ cians has no limits ( MS@@ F ) .
Minn@@ iti said that the number of migrants who arrived strongly in Italy during the last weeks is that efforts to strengthen the strengthening of Libyan coast @-@ guards and co @-@ operation with local citizens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days we started to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he has plans to talk about economic development initiatives in this month , with C@@ had , Niger and Mali about measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in hope to reach Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
An@@ asc@@ ents and Tri@@ als
&quot; &quot; &quot; nine We@@ il@@ er@@ mer bikers , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Berlin outdoor posts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ en@@ heim in the Nord@@ pf@@ alz to enjoy four days of trial and tourist attractions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three ordered guides were available for this .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer valley proved to be a good starting point for touring .
the Burg@@ und@@ y of Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour led for hot summer temperatures along the vineyards of the Micha@@ el@@ chapel above D@@ ei@@ des@@ heim .
it followed view@@ points , partly on towers , from which one could see far beyond the Pf@@ äl@@ zer forest and the pre @-@ bearing planes .
in between there was always extended asc@@ ents , for the long tri@@ als re@@ wards .
on the second day , it went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and the Volks@@ fest saus@@ ages market .

after 173 kilometers and nearly 4500 height meters , the Group had the Pf@@ äl@@ zer forest from its best side - spor@@ tive and cul@@ turally - met .
console instead of grass - Bundesliga b@@ other for e @-@ sport
sit the sports stars in future computer consoles instead , rather than battle at wind and weather about the stadium of the stadium ?
fact : e @-@ sport has long since become a serious business , become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - great stars , millions fans and huge tournaments with high g@@ ages including .
these have also recognized the first federal states that are increasingly involved in this field .
at the beginning of 2015 , the V@@ f@@ L Wolfsburg , later followed by FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last of the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @-@ sport department in mid @-@ July and took two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to inspire all new young target groups for V@@ f@@ B , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Managing Director Jochen Rö@@ tt@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure that some clubs will rise to this move . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
next weekend , FIFA World Championships organized the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup , &quot; which shows the Gam@@ er of different clubs against each other .
in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfsburg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or the PS@@ V Eindhoven have qualified .
also Robin d@@ utt looks great potential in e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ coach of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen has now advis@@ es an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real football must face in particular with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ old that the young people in the future go to the stadium , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 52 year old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and : the temp@@ ting , all possible markets , especially the Asian , to conquer .
with prominent e @-@ sport@@ s@@ men under contract , one could be present online much more often on these markets , than once in the year to send the federal government to Asia .
what is it exactly ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; at e @-@ sport , computer games like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; League Of Legends &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Dot@@ A 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or even the football simulation FIFA on con@@ tests . &quot; &quot; &quot;
long ago , as in normal sports , they have established themselves in which the pros cross each other .
and from the Asia to 2022 , e @-@ sport is already part of the official program .
but is it a real sport at all ?
for many , the performance is definitely used to be used .
Ingo F@@ rob@@ ber has also dealt with the question for a long time .
for the Professor at the German Sports Department in Cologne , E @-@ Sports is a sport , because he is competent and many biological and physical reactions that can also be found in classical sports - for example , increased heart rate , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes .
besides , it need cognitive skills , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and rapid response .
professional gam@@ ers should not only exercise on the console but also their body and take care of the diet .
&quot; the Jam Player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , F@@ rob@@ ber is also problems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; d@@ oping is becoming more a subject . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls are difficult to perform in online games , and in the scene the structures of the classical Sports are missing .
scientists emphas@@ izes the high inclusive effect of e @-@ sport .
players are international on the way , that &apos;s like a large global family , there are no inter@@ cultural inhibit@@ ors .
a study of the management consultants Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association Inter@@ active Entertainment Software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts a rapid growth .
in 2016 , over 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly on advertising , sponsor@@ ship and big tournaments .
in three years , revenue should be at 130 million .
against the nearly 2.4 billion euros of the football Bundesliga , this is little .
however , the e @-@ sport is not far from the other established sports like Hand@@ ball , basketball or ice hockey , &quot; write the Del@@ o@@ itte consultants .
International are many countries already .
large markets are Asia and the USA where ex @-@ basketball player Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ guez are participating in the US team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton K@@ ut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sport @-@ competitions Uni@@ kr@@ n .
there is a lot in Europe too .
in a Norwegian school E @-@ Sport has been introduced as a classroom , fan@@ atic says .
in the Netherlands and in France , the football @-@ premi@@ liga @-@ Ver@@ eine is obliged to set up an E @-@ Sport department .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European comparison , Germany is lag@@ ging behind , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B board Rö@@ tt@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to decay only in nost@@ algia , and to clari@@ fy the old times , is no longer enough .
it is necessary to preserve the tradition of the association , but the company will set up on the modern market at the same time .
&quot; we live in a digital world , &quot; says D@@ utt .

Michelle Carter because of the lyrics that Conrad Roy are pushing for suicide ,
a woman from Massachusetts has been sentenced to two and a half years , because she encouraged her friend by texts and calls for suicide .
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months in their condem@@ nation behind bars and five years suspended .
Carter was convicted in June due to a negli@@ g@@ ent k@@ illings of Conrad Roy who took life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at his hearing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My family is un@@ comfor@@ ting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to remain free until appeal .
she had been confron@@ ted with a 20 @-@ year jail term , but her legal representatives had argu@@ ed that both she and Mr Roy suffered from a mental illness .
dressed in red tro@@ users and a cream coloured bl@@ ouse , Carter stood there with tears in eyes , folded hands and down@@ ward eyes when she was condemned .
&quot; their actions have killed Conrad Roy , &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the Court .
&quot; she finished his life to make her own better .
she has no responsibility , &quot; she said .
&quot; it has shown no re@@ mor@@ se . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ters lawyer said it was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible change &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which they were utterly un@@ fortunate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; But he did not find out that her &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; age or ri@@ pen@@ ess or even their mental disease have a significant impact on their actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was a prosec@@ utor called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ ys Mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no day on which I don &apos;t consider the loss of my beloved son . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I want him to be proud of me and how I go with everything . I try , despite all my pain that we will bear with us for eternity , for his sisters , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ ys Sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she will be persecuted by the knowledge , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will never be part of her brother &apos;s wedding or would be a aun@@ t for his children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not to have this only person with which I have been together since my birth , is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case seems to be a righ@@ tful pri@@ ze@@ al attack , as there is no law in Massachusetts which makes it a crime to commit a others to commit suicide .
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning in a vehicle in 2014 .
the case referred national attention to themselves after Car@@ ters told text messages that they had encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hang up , spring from a building , get yourself , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said in several messages , which she had sent in the two weeks before his death , while he was on vacation with his family . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the eyes of his suicide , she wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must do it , Conrad , and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Everything you must do is to enter the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter sought attention through the death of Roy and ordered that they should profit from any press from the case .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
to the few who defended the Carter , in 2007 , Amanda Knox , who was convicted of murder in Italy because of murder , was acquitted two years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; MS Knox , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and help , not prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Joshua K@@ imm@@ ich : learning from the new Mini @-@ L@@ ah@@ m of FC Bayern
that Joshua K@@ imm@@ i was allowed to run by the Audi Cup as a captain , is not a co@@ incidence .
the FC Bayern entru@@ sts the Con@@ fed Cup winner a big season - extra motivation is not har@@ med up there .
something was different from his place in the cabin , which saw Joshua K@@ imm@@ ich immediately , even if the extra piece of clothes was very small , very small .
but as far as far and broad on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups , no Philipp L@@ ah@@ m and no Manuel Neuer had to be seen , he made himself split into his arm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Trainer has not announced it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner after his first use as Bavaria @-@ Captain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
good , the entry could run better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but the character of the coach was able to interpret .
not the eight year older Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al was chosen as a player leader in youth toys , de@@ but@@ ants and just from holidays .
you would like to be amazed at those you want to play a lot , you want to keep good in a mood .
so , who has been chosen to take the heritage of L@@ ah@@ m can only use a small extra motivation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ imm@@ i confirmed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what you want as a player to take responsibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old was fl@@ atter than mini @-@ L@@ ah@@ m over the field .
right behind , this is now its position , the white Bin@@ de on the arm did its rest .
and at all , K@@ imm@@ ich worked as the one that can take the ru@@ d@@ der also best in his hand .
he gave instructions to guide the un@@ claimed tro@@ upe .
he had the sight of the whole , while many others were busy .
Vid@@ al therefore to over@@ play its lack of fitness ( fol@@ dable ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches therefore , on the devil , come out of the services of the Asia @-@ journey ( fol@@ ly only condition@@ ally ) ; and Sebastian Rud@@ y and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le decided to drop in their first appearance in Bavaria @-@ tri@@ cot not neg@@ atively .
all that worked pretty good .
Sü@@ le ran beside k@@ imm@@ i , Rud@@ y before the defense on , both ag@@ itated so@@ vereign .
the well @-@ known Nap@@ oli storm showed itself very hard , in addition Sü@@ le tried to build a few times a few times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his colleague Rud@@ y said that the result was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not as we were hoping for . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also he showed good performance in the debut .
&quot; &quot; &quot; game shift , speed change : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this style I was brought to fet@@ ch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as un@@ familiar these Bayern @-@ Welt is still valid for the new entran@@ ces , the game was connected to the game .
Rud@@ y for example gave birth to the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs not one or two , but certainly six or seven interviews .
K@@ imm@@ i said goodbye after a few cris@@ p statements in the back of his new players .
there he heard of Sü@@ le an interesting set : &quot; what goes down here I &apos;ve already noticed .
you just have to win any game in Bavaria . &quot;
after all , he doesn &apos;t have to teach the new one .

company satisfied with the native American Minister : Economics pra@@ ises W@@ iss@@ ings Tempo
it was often im@@ plac@@ able that the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as Ev@@ eline Lem@@ ke ( Green ) , was still economic Minister of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate .
this is reflected in more than one year in which the new Minister for Economic Affairs Volker W@@ iss@@ ing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak on T V demand from a change in economic policy - and at the same time the old Minister of Minister .
Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ mmer ( V@@ TU ) , says , &quot; W@@ iss@@ ing attacks the wishes of the economy , which blocked all the lem@@ ma . &quot;
the largest of the revers@@ al increases Nat@@ us in infrastructure policy : the si@@ ps of highway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now in the priority list of the country .
still this year the ministry is hoping for a planning process by 2021 the building will stand .
a role in the plans of the country also plays in Trier , which stands in the urgent need of the Federal State Plan .
the aim is to take the route in December 2020 , says Minister &apos;s spokes@@ woman Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
Nat@@ us sees a sign for regional , but internationally competitive companies .
the industrial and Chamber of Commerce ( I@@ HK ) , which prov@@ okes a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate label , to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German wine exports for ten years .
in addition , w@@ iss@@ ing has an open ear for people who want to establish a company dedicated to the I@@ HK .
the Handwerk@@ skammer Trier sees an additional inc@@ en@@ tive for young trainees , says managing director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach .
it is planned to be a premium of 1000 Euro for the In@@ gre@@ dient master test and 2500 euros when graduates are independent within ten years after the championship training .
the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
in the planned road construction , you can quickly create facts , at the same time , out of the country at the necessary staff , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , CEO of the I@@ HK Trier .
only 29 places have been occupied by 56 new engineers who wish to set up mobility in national mobility .
the I@@ HK requires more orders to be awarded to external offices .
CDU &amp; D Group Christian Bald@@ auf refers to calculations of the Court of Audit@@ ors , the country invested more than 20 million euros less in the receipt of country roads in 2017 and 2018 .
furthermore , Frank Nat@@ us is expecting a concept of the country , as it wants to remedy the expertise in the region .
so@@ ber@@ ing is also the far broad@@ band extension in the country .
in 2016 , regional companies had only evaluated the power supply in an I@@ HK survey only with a note of 3.4 .
it compl@@ ained about mol@@ ding Internet connections and qu@@ arri@@ es .
ex @-@ econom@@ ist Ev@@ eline Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and is still sitting on the Supervisory Board of the wind power company Pro Wind .

Audi should change 8@@ 50.000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers are faced with a counter @-@ reaction .
one day before Audi &apos;s announcement , BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 35@@ 0,000 vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the BMW Group said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the opinion that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s smar@@ ter options &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and referring to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based - diesel vehicles to ban or re@@ tren@@ ch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
neither the companies described the companies as a recall .
European autom@@ akers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
but the nitrogen oxi@@ des , em@@ itting the diesel engines , are considered car@@ cin@@ ogenic and can cause asthma .
the cost of autom@@ akers , to install systems for neutr@@ alisation of diesel vehicles driven by diesel vehicles , also take advantage of what it makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
German chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel is also accused to ignore the powerful auto companies and ignore the signs of the problem .
the companies try to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen that could regul@@ ate the use of so @-@ called Ab@@ sch@@ alt machines to comply with the regulations when a car has been tested , but back to normal conditions .
in the United States several employees were indicted by Volkswagen , others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former leader of the ther@@ mod@@ y@@ nam@@ ics in the Audi engine development was arrested in Germany .
the former manager , Zac@@ che@@ o Giovanni Pam@@ io , is Italian and is therefore not protected from delivery and could be put in court in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations in Volkswagen , after the authorities of Audi were accused of having installed a system to deal with emission regulations in Europe , and an inquiry that concentrated on the United States was expanded .
the inclusion of Audi into the study might be heavily laden : the luxury car manufacturer is super@@ proportional to win Volkswagen &apos;s earnings .

Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll@@ es and the laughter against suffering
Mor@@ di@@ llo was a time of the most published cart@@ oons , the b@@ oll@@ es of his figures are his trademark .
also with 85 the Argent@@ in@@ ier is still working and working on a film .
his message : laughter , &quot; because there is too much sorrow in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist he stroke himself among other things as a drau@@ gh@@ ts@@ man for congrat@@ ulation - what fru@@ str@@ ated him .
&quot; the happ@@ iest day in my professional life was the day when lost in my job , &quot; he once said .
after charging stations in Lima , New York and Paris at the end of the 60s the breakthrough came : with the release of its cart@@ oons in Paris Match &quot; and then also in the &quot; Star &quot; and other leading magazines around the world .
even in China Mor@@ di@@ llo took many fans .
again , the artists were inspired by towns .
large , ro@@ un@@ dish mor@@ di@@ llo figures fro@@ w@@ ns in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning , he still sits at the animation today , working almost ten hours every day .
about calendars , puzzles , books for Gross and Small , T @-@ Shirts , Pl@@ ush Animals and watches do not find much dis@@ semin@@ ation worldwide .
he has been working on a cartoon animation and a TV series for six years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the principal person in the film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Crazy Island &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a gi@@ raffe - Mor@@ di@@ llo is any favourite animal in his drawings that has a thou@@ sand@@ th opponent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time his figures speak in the 3D @-@ film , which should be moved to the chin @-@ up wall in 2019 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what they will say , it &apos;s strange to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the script will not be written by him .
therefore , he is looking forward to the TV series , which is how his original drawings , password are produced .
lav@@ ender from Provence threatened by climate change
he became a symbol of Provence in southern France , but there is a warning that he is threatened with climate change .
the lav@@ ender is rel@@ ayed in terms of d@@ rought reflec@@ ting conditions and because of the ill@@ nesses of severe insects , which scientists and farmers , who try to find solutions , head@@ aches great head@@ aches .
Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the agricultural research institution CR@@ I@@ EP@@ P@@ AM in Provence , said : &quot; the Lav@@ ender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to climate change during the past years , much less rain in spring and much more in autumn .
this has effects on the lif@@ espan of lav@@ ender .
there is also a small c@@ ic@@ ade , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium that transm@@ its the Zwerg@@ zi@@ k@@ aden , and with very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and there is much on the game .
lav@@ ender oil is not only available for vac@@ ation@@ ists , it is also very asked for perf@@ umes and cosmetics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rather than having long plant clo@@ cks with a large number of flowers we have smaller , under@@ developed and either lack or weak@@ ened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so we have less parts with ether@@ ic oil . &quot;
solutions which are considered into account includes a better water distribution and the slow@@ ing of ev@@ ap@@ oration of the ground , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to dry .

the assassination of a journalist under@@ lines the growing threat in Mexico
the weekly paper Ri@@ odo@@ ce usually meet Wedn@@ esdays to check their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state S@@ inal@@ oa , which organised crime , corrupt civil servants and in@@ contin@@ ual drug wars .
but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
it was told them that it is important to change their rout@@ ines .
two high @-@ level journalists will discuss what feels more secure : they are supposed to take their children with gren@@ ades , which were the aim of an attack with gren@@ ades , or at home in 2009 .
security experts have three words on one board at the front of the room : opponent , neutral , allies .
you ask the rep@@ orters to propos@@ e names for each column - no proof is necessary , perc@@ ep@@ tions and abdominal muscles .
there are drug s@@ mu@@ g@@ gling , politicians , business people , journalists who are suspected of standing on the audit@@ ory list of government or cart@@ els , a catalogue of crimin@@ als that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there are no rest of violence , and while throughout the country the cor@@ p@@ ses are increasingly frequent : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique P@@ ena Nie@@ to took office in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 , according to attacks and threats , there were at least seven deaths in seven countries this year .
among the latter you are editor and her inspir@@ ator of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , the co @-@ founder Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest mistake is to be living in Mexico and journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Val@@ dez , in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his ste@@ aling is deeply experienced when his presence is present - a large photo by Val@@ dez , which shows his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice &quot; . two rep@@ orters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Miri@@ am R@@ ami@@ rez , carry t @-@ shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and rep@@ orters discuss their shared topics , the trau@@ ma , their night@@ mar@@ es , in@@ som@@ nia , par@@ ano@@ ia .
even though 2010 , a prob@@ ing Office has been erected to process the cases of journalists , it has led only two criminal proceedings according to the committee to protect journalists .
as for most thousands of Mor@@ den , who are related to drug traff@@ icking and organized crime every year , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are only rarely asked in court .
at Ri@@ odo@@ ce they are still insist@@ ing to treat the violence of S@@ inal@@ oa , although they are in@@ consol@@ ing and although the terrain is still ob@@ itu@@ ent .
without information about the killer , without justice , the meeting for discussion of safety has little use , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as long as we don &apos;t know why , we don &apos;t mis@@ let everyone . &quot;
in the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez left the office of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he only managed to drive a few blocks before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was forced by two men . he was shot from his car and 12 times was shot on him , presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; forced river . &quot;
the cap drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to wander@@ ing in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an freely around .
but there is nothing but silence on the subject of Val@@ dez .
since Gu@@ z@@ mans was arrested in the past year and the extra@@ dition to the United States in January was S@@ inal@@ oa , one of the most bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country , because rival fac@@ tions were strug@@ gling here to fill the vacuum .
it doesn &apos;t matter that in S@@ inal@@ oa , anyone or more people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of en@@ chan@@ ted , two @-@ story Maus@@ ole@@ en for drug addic@@ ts , which are larger than many homes for the living .
&quot; &quot; &quot; forget about a minute that there is a state of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calm &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if only one car@@ tel control over the coast with its valuable ports and drugs trade routes in the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , was broken with the gu@@ ilt that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ concep@@ tions have contributed to the murder .
first of all , there was the publication of a interview with Dam@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of the rival car@@ tel fra@@ ctions in war with Gu@@ z@@ mans @-@ sons .
this publication may have been anno@@ yed by the sons , whom members bought up every copy of the edition , once they have been extra@@ d@@ ited to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks .
the second fault was not to force Val@@ dez , after the sei@@ z@@ ure of a different newspaper , which had published the same story to leave the country on its own safety .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues im@@ itate that he would always be there .
he was an experienced rep@@ orter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 when he joined forces with five colleagues to the foundation of Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in S@@ inal@@ oa , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was impossible to run journ@@ alism without the problem of the cra@@ b problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with time , the paper has earned a reputation for the brave and honest coverage , and the turnover and advertising took over .
rep@@ orters loved it , hard @-@ resolved investigations without fear of c@@ ens@@ orship , and the reader was fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody had to handle .
eight years after the creation of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors Cab@@ ot Prize &quot; for its coverage in Latin America .
in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee to Protect Journ@@ alists for his courage in pursu@@ ing the Mexican drug history , wherever it led .
he volunte@@ ered to be afraid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to continue to live , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; drug traff@@ icking in S@@ inal@@ oa , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a way of life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in October last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you need to take over the task that falls to you as a journalist - either the or you play the dum@@ my . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what did you do in the face of so many moments ... why did you not say what was going on ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ o@@ ce team mi@@ res Val@@ dez , the fun bird that was like a do@@ ck@@ worker , who was a friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
you trusted in his routine .
he would always carry his hat .
he would always go to El Guay@@ abo , the bar opposite the office , and there is always sitting at the same table .
now ask them : was his love for routine his cal@@ am@@ ity ?
his death also forced them to ask their own ass@@ ump@@ tions about how they can do their work on the best and stay alive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t like it if you deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their home starting and run@@ ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ mol@@ ding and self @-@ maintenance .
trust his own inst@@ inc@@ ts .
if it smells bad , stay away from it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the trouble is , the editor of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce And@@ res Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smell a sense that can be fool@@ ed ... and then the thing happened with Javier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old rules , how he and others say , apply in S@@ inal@@ oa , not just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states in which a toxic mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ances , weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home .
the landscape is changing constantly .
in the room where the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce met for security training , there were suddenly no mobile phones allowed . days before , Spy@@ ware , which is sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside , two police officers sought shelter from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .
they were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building from Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
half of the j@@ est , some of the rep@@ orters question@@ ed whether these officers were among the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen , which the governor himself said as not tru@@ st@@ worthy .
it is months ago , since the rep@@ orter had gone into the mountain landscape , where the drug gangs de facto are under control .
for the edition of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ ce has blocked three main stories .
there was the murder of the brother of the former famous Box@@ er Julio C@@ esar Cha@@ vez in S@@ inal@@ oa .
they also had an Ex@@ pos@@ é to state expend@@ itu@@ res , focusing on the home town of the Governor .
there was a group found in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the Office of the Office of the Office .
there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or how it happened , so caution was advis@@ able when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows that restaurant is a favourite locally by drug traff@@ ickers and authorities .
a rep@@ orter knew from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a polit@@ ician , who ruled the ruling Inst@@ itutional Revolution Party ( pr@@ i ) that ruled nearly all the century all political planes .
several pr@@ i govern@@ ors were accused of corruption because of high @-@ term corruption .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the rep@@ orter to write about previous inci@@ dents in this restaurant , including one in which a son of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man went into a military attack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a few months earlier , readers of Val@@ dez have been considered the best informed source of ab@@ duction .
&quot; in the past we had known what happened , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nickname &quot; El FLACO &quot; because of its slender body st@@ ature .
&quot; all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
the office of Val@@ dez was dedicated to the storage room for signs and st@@ ickers that are dedicated to the Mor@@ de of journalists dedicated to something they would never expect : activists in the name of the press .
rep@@ orter Miri@@ am R@@ ami@@ rez gra@@ ven a few signs and went next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist for the office of the Prosecutor .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed , in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA testing that it is its .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the whole country , journalists have become lou@@ der in organized protests &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SOS Press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on walking trails and buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on this day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is away in Washington and tries to gather international support for the justice in the case Val@@ dez .
at a meeting with the governor of S@@ inal@@ oa on the day after the assassination of Val@@ dez , R@@ ami@@ rez accused the authorities to provo@@ ke journalists , because they have told the truth .
she has asked that she was re@@ group@@ ed by the government because she is worried that her anger has injured their objec@@ tivity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico by organised crime committed by the government officials and a similar society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co Journ@@ alism &quot; he wrote that rep@@ orters are not only killed by drugs , but also on the command of politicians and security forces working with organised crime under a blanket .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the media group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Artic@@ ulo 19 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials last year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you die in Mexico because they want you to hold the mouth , &quot; said R@@ ami@@ rez .
obviously the mur@@ der@@ ers have a deter@@ rent effect .
no one forget the death of the Blo@@ g@@ ist Maria Elizabeth Mac@@ ias in the northern boundary of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
her body was found together with a note that was signed by the Z@@ etas car@@ tel : &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and ear@@ phones lay apart from its separate head .
some stores have chosen , like the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern boundary of Ch@@ ihu@@ ah@@ ua after the assassination of the correspon@@ dents MI@@ RO@@ S@@ LA@@ VA Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue to do as El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo after the assassination of her director in 2004 .
in 2010 the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ arez became public in the drug area with an editorial on the front@@ page with the heading &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists are fled from their home states or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it is hard to find work in exile , and they still watch the streets and search for dangers .
and sometimes they are hun@@ ted as apparently the photographer of Reuben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who continue to stay and continue working , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be po@@ ets , indicates that the drug traff@@ icking is fri@@ ghtened .
&quot; Mexico goes to hell and therefore I became rep@@ orter , &quot; he said .
at midnight , last Friday , when the last issue was finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce sat down on the side@@ walk before the office and drank beer when all their phones began to h@@ um .
a number of shooting plants with band@@ its and security forces close to the Maz@@ at@@ lan resort had left 19 victims .
the war continued , as it was promised by a number of car@@ tel messages in the region .
from the st@@ ony edge they released the news on the Ri@@ odo@@ ce Web site via mobile .
the front page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ rens he@@ aps close to - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the police officers , who guard the guard to see if they were in read@@ iness .
if they were afraid , they did not show it .
under the enormous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for quite S@@ inal@@ oa , the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed his mark .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you only think about it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If on the same day , when I was murdered , the intern asked me to send them to the road to the road . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dinosau@@ rs used clo@@ aking to sof@@ ten his enemies
at first glance , it looks like a statue , if also a fri@@ ghtening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now researchers have found that the first findings of the unbelievable Nash@@ ville of a Canadian mountain worker were so well received that experts have described it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the dinosau@@ rs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was so good that they could even state that his sli@@ pp@@ est skin was of red@@ dish Braun - and they said they had had something from a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ peaceful past &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Current Biology &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; referred to as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; preserved dinosau@@ rs &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which was ever found , and one of the best dinosau@@ rs specimens of the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fossil is a newly discovered type of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier who lived in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ace@@ ous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
his incredibly well preserved state , researchers , who seem to describe it as &quot; truly remarkable &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ar@@ mo@@ red plant car@@ ni@@ vo@@ res is the most preserved F@@ ossil of its kind .
it was found by Shawn Funk , on March 21 , 2011 at the Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Murray , in the north of Alberta , Canada , pit .
he met something which seemed from the surrounding cliffs of the Plat@@ ze , and decided to look more closely .
the fossil discovered by him was sent into the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to un@@ cover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) .
after all these hard work , the finished outcome is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; if you flash just a little with the eyes , you could almost believe that it has slept , &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , Scienti@@ sts in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum , where the creature is visible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be in the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosau@@ rs specimens - the Mon@@ a Lisa of Dinosau@@ rs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
researchers have found that this plant car@@ ni@@ vo@@ res , although it is covered with a arm@@ or and re@@ sembles a changing tank , probably threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous dinosau@@ rs .
the heavily ar@@ mo@@ red dinosau@@ rs used a red and white clo@@ ak to hide from smokers , and used a par@@ ach@@ uting technology that is known as counter@@ cre@@ mation that is also used by many modern animals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this could have been allowed to improve in its surroundings and to increase its enemies , say experts , which suggests that it was threatened by major dinosau@@ rs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 110 million @-@ year @-@ old creature from the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier family has been head@@ lines for the first time in May and is now visible in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal and it is called Bo@@ re@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the museum engineer Mark Mitchell , one of a team that spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours with it carefully .
the amazing surprise of copy allowed it to document Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists , the pattern and the shape of sheds and arm@@ or over his body .
they discovered the conf@@ ession , a widespread defence method in animal kingdom , which means that the top of the creature was dar@@ ker than its bottom .
although the conversion is common , the results are surprising since the size of Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta is by far the animals living today .
it indicates that the dinosau@@ rs was ch@@ ased out of enough pressure through meat @-@ wing dinosau@@ rs , that evolution has benef@@ itted the tear of the confron@@ tation as a means of survival .
but most contemporary animals , who use the sh@@ ady sh@@ ady - think of Re@@ he , zeb@@ ras or belt @-@ animals - are much smaller and viol@@ ate than loo@@ t , what is sign@@ aled that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real struggle for survival .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strong pre@@ dat@@ ory behaviour on a massive , heavily ar@@ mo@@ red dinosau@@ rs view how dangerous the dinosau@@ rs ro@@ bs have to have been &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chemical analysis organic compounds in their scales shows that the skin of the dinosau@@ r bay was rot@@ ten .
scientists will continue to investig@@ ate the animal on his life including its conservative loan , to find out what it has eaten as his last meal .
they believe that the dinosau@@ rs , when he died , got into a river and sank into the sea , where he fell on the back to the sea floor .
at that time , Alberta was as warm as southern fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans are likely to spread much further inland as they are today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable because it is completely covered in three dimensions but also maintains the original form of the animal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that the animal today looks like in the early C@@ ret@@ ace@@ ous period . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you don &apos;t need to use much imagination to re@@ design it . if you have only a little with your eyes , you could almost feel that he is at bed@@ time . &quot;
the chal@@ k time was a time when giant Ther@@ op@@ oden , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous dinosau@@ rs , who stood on two legs , crossed the earth .
although the king of them , Ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Rex , lived million years after Bo@@ re@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mo@@ red dinosau@@ rs was hun@@ ted by some of his fur@@ ious ancestors .
this includes the Acro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 @-@ foot ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long , six tonnes heavy monsters .
the scientists , their latest findings in the journal Current Biology seem to believe that Bo@@ re@@ op@@ el@@ ta was sank after death in the ocean and in mud .
the creature was found by Shawn Funk , on March 21 , 2011 at the Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Murray , in the north of Alberta , Canada , pit .
according to the museum it is the guarded dinosau@@ rs of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip .
the creatures were on average for about 18 feet ( 5 feet ) long and have weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch @-@ long tops that ra@@ ced from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mo@@ red plant car@@ ni@@ vo@@ res was devast@@ ated through the western Canada , until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea .

in the storm : Mass@@ enk@@ ar@@ amb@@ ol@@ age in A8 : lots of injured
heavy accident on Thursday evening on the A8 : almost 30 vehicles are involved in a massage roller .
there are numerous injured , mile long st@@ ems - and g@@ aff@@ er .
on the Autobahn Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A8 ) , approximately 20 people were injured on the late Thursday afternoon .
after the first information of the police were at 17.00 o &apos;clock between the connecting stations Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district of A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm , probably barely 30 vehicles , including probably trucks .
there is no information about the exact number of injured .
it is mild to moderate injuries , a police pre@@ acher said .
a large charge of rescue vehicles was at the accident .
the A8 was closed in direction of Munich .
in the direction of Munich , a ten @-@ kilometer long retreat was formed .
like an AZ rep@@ orter , it came also on the return way to massive discounts - by numerous G@@ aff@@ er .
the fire brig@@ ade rep@@ elled the attributes of the vehicle manufacturers to have now been reck@@ oned with sensitive pen@@ alties .
shortly after 18 : 45 , a second accident occ@@ ured on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
it was a coll@@ ision between a car carrier and passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident .
Deutsche Bahn : group tests &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced once : nothing remin@@ is@@ cent of the train and sleeps .
or you are deep@@ ened in his work and has just a brilliant mind .
and then : pu@@ ff@@ f .
comes the conductor and w@@ akes up an uns@@ ur@@ ft or ri@@ ps the g@@ ast in the middle of the workflow .
ticket control .
but the times of the break are over .
the German rail@@ ways currently test@@ i@@ fies the registered travel card control .
you simply confirm by mobile phone that you take up its place and evalu@@ ates the ticket .
currently there is a test run on two routes .
&quot; comes the offer , we extend it out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will be available next year on many other traffic circuits in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a train speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; calls the train to the pay@@ back dev@@ alu@@ ation without a conductor .
in order to use the benefits , however , some conditions need to be met : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to booked an online ticket - which is already what most passengers do already .
you have to have purchased the DB Navigator App , which is the most convenient way of ticket booking anyway .
and last you need a seat reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works : one climb@@ s in the train , calls his ticket under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My tickets &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the test customers then appears a button for the electronic resolution .
the train guides will get a message on their mobile devices that driving g@@ ast X is on the train and took the booked seat Y .
after the ticket control of the ticket inspection at number Y , he knows that there is a passenger with already de@@ pri@@ ved online ticket .
so you can keep on sleeping , continue working , keep silent .
the &quot; Check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the railway - which in turn should take advantage of the passengers .
&quot; those who want to travel without ticket inspection by our train accompanying personnel will check in the DB Navigator itself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this allows the passengers to create their travel time in the train of personal identity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Head of DB &apos;s correspondence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our staff have more time to go to today &apos;s individual needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those often travel by rail , knows that the ticket checks are among the biggest nu@@ ances .
because often one does not have any documents in any case , but one of the participants will not require all the documents needed for the evaluation of online tickets .
either is the credit card or the ID card or otherwise a document needed .
the consequence are endless discussions between mig@@ rat@@ ory directors and passenger , which leads to a bad mood in the tro@@ op or greater space and delays in control of your own ticket and the conductor will take time to take care of other concerns .
only a small number of test@@ ers can use the new service .
and this also applies to the ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart @-@ Essen connections .
further train numbers on the same route are not yet un@@ locked yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 9 August 2014 , Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rel was shaken up to its core .
just one day after it arrived in New York City , sitting in St. Louis Geb@@ or@@ ene sat on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment that rented and sc@@ roll@@ ers through Facebook on their phone .
she stum@@ bled across a post from someone from High School .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police has just killed an 18 year old child , and it is still on the road , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was it there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused as nobody else had posted the information on her feed , she closed Twitter and opened Twitter .
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Ph@@ aro@@ ah was constantly ret@@ ched on their tim@@ eline .
the Rap@@ per in the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white polic@@ eman in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , was killed live .
he posted a picture of Brow@@ ns le@@ ased body that was stretched out on the road and would stay there for four hours .
&quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; Fer@@ rell thought .
but death was nothing new for her and community .
she placed her mobile phone to get back to twe@@ ets on Can@@ field Drive later in the evening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there were photos of police force and people , the cried , and from a man who claimed to be a shield with the inscription : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Police killed just my un@@ armed son ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she observed a live feed at which a polic@@ eman stood in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bar@@ king dog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in another video , she said , another polic@@ eman assured his rif@@ le and cried , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am going to kill you ... animals all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is not common , &quot; Fer@@ rell re@@ minded of her testimony .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the type of murder , to which we have used to us and which we can name typical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that moment , I felt sh@@ aking .
I was angry and wept . &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after the landing at 23 o &apos;clock , she took her 6 year old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on next morning .
what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on is the subject of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets , &quot; in cinemas from the 11 .
it is a history of survival and protest , love and loss of loss , strength and resistance , which is from the point of view , living in community and have filled the streets to demand answers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when Fer@@ rel came with her daughter , who took a flower @-@ dress and a suitable crown , speaking after F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , they talked many times before this morning &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the black experience and the black state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; remember what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because police killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that was not correct . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I couldn &apos;t take it , &quot; Fer@@ rell said later .
&quot; what happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past .
it must know , and it must be tu@@ cked and tu@@ cked up there .
it must be well developed , not only ac@@ ti@@ vis@@ m and organisation , but also know the different layers of the black experience and the black constitution and what we have to do to free ourselves .
even if I &apos;m lucky enough to give you an experience in which they do not have an ek@@ lat@@ ant rac@@ ism , it is no different than the next black women child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I feel the feeling I would give you a bad service , to keep them away from them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police station , which became a camp@@ ground as the activists on the possible non @-@ charge of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson were waiting .
Fer@@ rell and her daughter have joined together with a local business partner who made lunch .
they put bags before and helped to pass on demonstr@@ ators .
slowly , a new species of ac@@ ti@@ vis@@ m began to take in the form of Fer@@ rel .
&quot; my ac@@ ti@@ vis@@ m changed after August 9 , &quot; she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ souri @-@ St. Louis , President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on food @-@ justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities .
&quot; I had no experience in the organization .
it has all come . &quot;
weeks later , Fer@@ rell met the Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an evening , one of the film &apos;s co @-@ directors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an , she and her c@@ amer@@ aman , Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ rar , wanted to document &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; document what happened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a question came to the sense : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story you can use ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these ske@@ p@@ tic@@ ism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often from white - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently said in an interview : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had heard that people who were born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on and have raised their voices , and we wanted to make it different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked together with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the field that is around to@@ dest@@ ra@@ kt for his ac@@ ti@@ vis@@ m .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his commitment brought the project closer to the project , along with six other indigenous people followed the team of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the years after Brow@@ ns . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talking to us . we talk , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Davis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this was the main thing for me as these people are represented , for so I will be represented . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the goal was to focus on Fer@@ rel@@ ls experience - to show that it is not a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Messi@@ ah &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; movement , but for a community that comes together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - it proved the most obvious participant in the film . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a result , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of Fer@@ rel@@ ls &apos; lives as she married and married her wife .
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; Fer@@ rell , and laughed , when she saw the finished product for the first time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understood that in this work and in the de@@ human@@ ization of black people must give a certain vulner@@ ability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Fer@@ rel@@ ls History re@@ iter@@ ates the role of black gay women in the bro@@ ader Black @-@ Li@@ ves movement .
two of the three founders of the movement , who have marked the movie &quot; Black@@ li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media in 2012 , identify themselves as gay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have borne the movement altogether , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rell said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and therefore we are constantly fighting in different fron@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women must bear the main burden of everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it insist@@ ed that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not a affir@@ m@@ ative type of action , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Fer@@ rel was selected as the heart of the film . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she was the person she shook her energy , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is no co@@ incidence , although it was at the fore@@ front , because in a life there was a black , gay woman is so much on the game . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can sense your energy through the screen . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long disappeared , but the ra@@ cial connection between the community and the police continue to exist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fer@@ rel is at the currency for 2 ½ years due to blocking a highway at a demonstration .
she describes the social atmosphere in the area that she calls her home : &quot; a chaos . &quot;
however , she kl@@ es herself on a singing and she feels his memory because she left three years ago in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on .
&quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we need to love and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; Dream &quot; to &quot; Dimen@@ sions &quot; : TV readers discuss@@ ing a bit gallery
the bit gallery moves people , although they haven &apos;t been built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian zone is out@@ dated since the first presentation of 2009 the population in advoc@@ ates and opponents .
cold leaves the subject hardly any cold .
the topic &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; is also discussed on our Facebook page .
while the one to a bit gallery say : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; That would be real great &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; no man &quot; ( Sig@@ gi Now@@ y ) or quite simply : &quot; mag@@ n@@ itude &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) .
while the advoc@@ ates are building that there will be a gallery of more clients in the city , while others also benefit from other business , fear that the pedestrian zone are bleeding .
furthermore , the gallery will be planned on the grounds , on which the farmers market stands will offer their products in the 13 direct market .
the construction work will conclude with the start of construction .
the gallery M@@ acher want to integrate a market hall in the new building - and for Bed@@ a place with possibility to sit outside .
Simone Room : &quot; we have been selling almost weekly in the pe@@ asant market for many years .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the land come back very much .
we also discovered the but@@ cher shop for us .
we would wish that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery , there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is also that .
above all the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ensing : &quot; whether direct markets in a market in the gallery , the rent comes to the amount of rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the new project will probably not be low . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what shopping possibility in Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothing , shoes , dro@@ pping or supermarkets : I find the superf@@ lu@@ ous .
there are plenty of them in our city .
you see how many shop@@ keepers standing empty here - some for months and years .
however , since there is not even a regular weekly market , it is all the more important to us at least the market hall remains .
after all , the product offered is fresh , mostly offered directly from producer and is inexpensive .
as you can see , shop operations are rented in a shopping mall only by major companies , because the local h@@ unters are often not portable for a retail@@ er .
too bad , special stores there is almost no more and what is left of it , will probably disappear . &quot;
Wolf Fan@@ del : &quot; a shopping center with a market hall doesn &apos;t fit for me .
and the gallery does not fit into Bit@@ burg .
above all : where should the farmers market hall pass during the building time ?
the old E@@ DE@@ KA would be the solution - even on the duration , if the bit gallery is actually coming .
or does it manage the g@@ hosts bit gallery earlier , to drive all the shops from Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; that &apos;s just not working .
and one shopping center , which is empty , doesn &apos;t need any .
in my view it would have been better to promote a real farm market instead of this gallery .
but for a pe@@ asant market , it is thanks to the crazy many - how I find - sen@@ sel@@ ess construction projects in Bit@@ burg no place anymore .
when the pe@@ asant mark@@ thalle is made , a piece of culture will disappear . &quot;
a suitable simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ings DNA
in the middle of the room of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces are visible - white , black and brown , which are almost in@@ visi@@ bly the same - hanging on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from che@@ eks and hair cut , which were sent to by Chelsea M@@ anning .
M@@ anning sent out the excer@@ pts from the prison Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth where the former intelligence analy@@ zer had served a 35 @-@ year @-@ old prison sentence , after which she publicly de@@ pressed diplomatic messages to the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website .
the new exhibition opened on August 2 , is called &quot; Bec@@ oming Res@@ em@@ bl@@ ance ( An appropriate re@@ sem@@ bl@@ ance ) .
she is the product of two years correspon@@ dent between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline was united in technology , computer science and art , and M@@ anning , a Trans@@ woman and a white dis@@ sident , when he was only three days in his office .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has been created by the algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA , which could look up from M@@ anning , a sharp comment not only to the form@@ ul@@ ability of DNA data - the many ways you can interpre@@ ts and the inher@@ ent det@@ er@@ mining of these inter@@ pret@@ ations - but also for identity .
M@@ anning , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , has already been convicted of the identification as a woman since their pu@@ ber@@ ty , was convicted of 20 charges , including six violations of the sp@@ ying law , computer fraud and theft .
through the prison , her image was supp@@ ressed , so much that it only gave a single photo - a gra@@ ined , black @-@ white Sel@@ f@@ ie , in which M@@ anning is visi@@ bly sitting on a driver &apos;s seat and a plat@@ ted blonde w@@ ishing is associated with which it was associated .
in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came straight from the great success of their 2012 @-@ project &quot; Stran@@ ger Vis@@ ions &quot; .
in it the artist produced portraits of foreigners from for@@ en@@ sic arti@@ facts like cigarette st@@ ains and che@@ wing gum , by removing the DNA from the tr@@ ash to make a picture of it , like those people might look .
this was the time they received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they led an interview with Chelsea M@@ anning , while she was in prison , and they wanted to accompany a kind of portrait to this article , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg in a press preview of the new exhibition .
and she could not visit at that time and could not be photographed , so you took contact with Chelsea and asked if they wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her incar@@ cer@@ ated m@@ use became an un@@ equal letter that followed several letters in the course of two years .
they even created a comic of Sho@@ ili can@@ y@@ o illustrated Comic &quot; Supp@@ le Images , &quot; who would like to convert a future to see the president Chel@@ y@@ ss Jud@@ gment , and it would be able to see the exhibition personally .
that Obama actually was just a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ings would demand for seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas , was a welcome kind of lucky meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is also something deep in the opening of the exhibition &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Low and Star@@ kes , because Donald Tr@@ ump leads a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camps and against Trans@@ gender @-@ troops to find new , twe@@ aked ways , which he should fix , go on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , after the strange tim@@ ing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen for a certain reason . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in one on the wall of the gallery &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ anning with its over@@ sized signature &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her family name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) is an end to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automatic sh@@ atter@@ ing , whose foundation gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the opposite wall is its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thou@@ sand@@ th of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hop@@ ed to show through the inclusion of 200 letters ( or nu@@ cle@@ ot@@ ide after the highly developed scientific Dictionary of the artist ) , as surprisingly similar , at least in biological ways we are all .
&quot; what people will hopefully take away , is that our gen@@ ome doesn &apos;t care about who we are and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work is to be seen from 2007 , Sp@@ ur@@ ious Mem@@ ories .
&quot; DNA data can tell as many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in its own room , is one side of the Comic @-@ Nov@@ elle mentioned above .
it shows M@@ anning as they appear with a free @-@ free trade in the hand of the United States like King Kong .
&quot; if they ch@@ ill out your speech , they have won , &quot; says it .
&quot; so never keep your mouth . &quot;
&quot; it came directly from a letter which she wrote to me , &quot; said the artist , who gre@@ ets the Philadelphia .
&quot; I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ um@@ ps when I speak about it . &quot;
M@@ anning has not seen the exhibition yet - as it was supposed to do in the Com@@ ic@@ book - but if they should do it , then it will be greeted in the middle of the room of the Mas@@ ks , who co@@ inci@@ de with their own genom@@ ic sim@@ ulations like hor@@ des of protest@@ ers .
it was also aimed at how everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ings St@@ ature ) , were written with a pencil in which their genetic hap@@ l@@ groups have been written .
&quot; in the past I had them on the wall but I wanted to feel like a crowd of people , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , from the portraits .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement , which formed to Chelsea , like the movement , which also was behind their liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor of the University of Nor@@ th@@ western and an employee of the University of Oxford for murder
a nationwide human hunt is underway for a professor at Nor@@ th@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford published as susp@@ ects , after a man was stab@@ bed to death in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injury .
on Monday for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham L@@ ath@@ em ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) arrest warran@@ ts were issued because of its alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , such as the files of the Regional Court of Cook County .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several p@@ ens .
a public warning system was published by the Chicago police authority that the bodies were discovered on July 27 .
officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victims with several injuries in his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was declared to be dead in the place of action for dead , and det@@ ec@@ tives investig@@ ate the stal@@ ks as murder while the police are actively looking for the two susp@@ ects , said officials .
since 2007 L@@ ath@@ em has been a associate professor of Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at Nor@@ th@@ western University .
Alan K. Cub@@ bage , Vice President for University Relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that L@@ ath@@ em has now been excluded in be@@ ur@@ lau@@ de and from the campus of Nor@@ th@@ western University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal matter which is examined by the competent authorities and the Nor@@ th@@ western University operates at this investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Cub@@ bage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man of the University and the Som@@ erv@@ ille College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in touch with the police in the UK in contact and ready to help US investig@@ ative authorities &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement said that War@@ ren colleagues were shocked and wanting to put himself .
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago police department , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he strongly urge the susp@@ ects to oppos@@ e the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have an idea of their where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to loc@@ alize them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help find the susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that the police got a call from building manager of the Grand @-@ Plaza building , who had just received an en@@ ig@@ matic tip that happened in the apartment 100@@ 8 .
the police described the scene as a very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was un@@ clear whether the incident occurred on July 27 .
it was confirmed by security cameras that L@@ ath@@ em and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victims had a relationship , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the management team from Grand Plaza published a declaration to the residents : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police currently works at the time axis and the background of the victim and resear@@ ches a variety of mot@@ if@@ s , including a possible domestic approach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we will conclude the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; - the Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mut@@ ko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said it will not take long until the remaining criteria of the World Anti D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented for rest@@ oring the Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a certain stage of ful@@ fill@@ ment of the criteria of the road@@ map R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with UK@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the WA@@ DA road@@ map was updated in this regard , &quot; explained Mut@@ ko on Thursday .
the PM commented on the second part of the schedule of WA@@ DA to comply with the Code that describes the criteria for replacement of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and recently published on the website of the organization .
according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything for Russia &apos;s cause .
&quot; everything has been announced , everything is being implemented .
and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and WA@@ DA in the near future . &quot; he added .
one of the criteria mentioned in the list , however , is that the Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping authorities appro@@ ves the reported outcome of the WA@@ DA approved by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren to be publicly subsidi@@ zed Dop@@ ings in Russian sports .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in relation to the matter Mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we carry out an investigation into our anti @-@ d@@ oping system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there were no state programs , and we will not add something which does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mut@@ k@@ os Wor@@ ds voted by Vit@@ aly Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v , the leader of the independent Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping Commission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in conversation with the Russian sales outlet R@@ Sport at the beginning of the day Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v gave problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping organizations , but added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have repeated that the report contains controversial positions and regulations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no one has un@@ condition@@ ally accept this report , &quot; Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v added .
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded in November 2015 in the wake of d@@ oping sc@@ and@@ als from the WA@@ DA by the implementation of Dop@@ ing@@ checks in Russia .
however , you have been allowed to plan and coordin@@ ate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK anti @-@ d@@ oping ( UK@@ AD ) .
following a visit to the headquarters in Moscow in July , WA@@ DA @-@ Director , Olivier Niger , declared that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA moves &quot; in the right direction , &quot; to be used again .

the Start ups that will help your company not to become the next U@@ ber
Amy Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure luck at your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the p@@ olls did not work .
answers were often vag@@ ue , little helpful or - even worse - dec@@ eit@@ ful .
and even if you promised an@@ on@@ ym@@ ity , some workers don &apos;t dare to do the process .
&quot; there was just never consist@@ ency and objec@@ tivity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care Company Madison Re@@ ed .
she called people from outside to help .
a new race of human resources start@@ ups is at the wa@@ xing in helping companies to find out how their employees feel .
by creating and licensing of software , which has the specific purpose of measuring the employee &apos;s commitment , it allows companies to deal with surveys and demo@@ graphic groups , and in some cases W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers allow to b@@ ypass the C @-@ Suite exec@@ u@@ tives and turn directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; you now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for pursu@@ ing their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analy@@ tics tools is used by companies to measure employees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ ret@@ t said she had a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ lin@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the S@@ nap @-@ P@@ olls and P@@ olls of certain teams , it offers a heat card of the company that shows the units most complaints and what exec@@ u@@ tives find low tuning results so that they can drill , why .
companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture , so that you have not been involved in sc@@ and@@ als since then a former employee has published a blog post , which describes a environment of har@@ ass@@ ment , in which those who have spoken , punished .
for start @-@ ups such as G@@ lin@@ t , this wish is a lu@@ cr@@ ative business possibility .
global govern@@ ance , regulation and compliance industry could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion worth , following the financial technical website let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Conver@@ cent , the company helps prevent bad conduct and recognize , saw an increasing interest and activity in the beginning of this year in the middle of the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
Conver@@ cent has nearly 600 clients including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tesla .
u@@ ber recently registered as a client .
as G@@ lin@@ t , Conver@@ cent Company makes tail@@ or @-@ made &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , collect confi@@ dential answers in real time and view the warmth cards of your problem areas .
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line , with which employees can report a bad behaviour .
and if the main business leaders are included , complaints are directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judgment of public opinion has gras@@ ped the Reg@@ ul@@ ators , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Patrick Quin@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Conver@@ cent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a company is found that his staff is badly treated or in@@ ethical , it may experience costly consequences by consumers &quot; boy@@ cott , workers &quot; fluctu@@ ation and complaints , &quot; Quin@@ lan said .
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25.000 employees and over 500 locations , has used Conver@@ cent for more than one year to ensure that employees are conscious of politics and procedures and a simple way to achieve their corporate headquarters .
previously , if a employee had to report a problem , he had to submit a formal complaint or e @-@ mail for the corporate headquarters , a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously .
it was often an in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation and un@@ comfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ruby TU@@ ES@@ DA@@ YS General Coun@@ sel , who said it was not a good way to track the complaints of employees .
well , since the company Conver@@ tible deals , problems , who were sitting in offices in cities or countries , were hidden , such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment , or un@@ fair practic@@ ants are identified .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can get closer to this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view to the experience with employment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano that leads the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment lit@@ ig@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies started to take Eth@@ ics , Val@@ ues and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Commit@@ ment in 2002 after the accounting company Arthur Ander@@ sen , for ethnic violations caused by the Enron sc@@ andal , said Quin@@ lan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it took until the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social Media &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came to their right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that companies realized you could not prevent her dirty laundry online . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; prior to the use of technology for eth@@ ics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said .
both G@@ lin@@ t and Conver@@ cent offer your software as a service , and charges the businesses with recur@@ ring charges for use of their products .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a business model and a chance to find the company &apos;s approval by Venture Capital investors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Conver@@ cent received $ 10 million in funding in February of companies such as Sapphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , with which the total capital was raised to $ 47 million .
gl@@ itz@@ ers secured $ 10 million in November by Bes@@ se@@ mer Venture Partners and earned its overall funding to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising , given the net@@ worked nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more than now . &quot; &quot; &quot;
competitive markets such as Silicon Valley are high sal@@ aries and interesting projects only inser@@ ts .
the staff want you to feel accepted and appreciated that you will be able to spend your time a company with a positive mission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when people are happy to be in a company that will do their voices , and that the work that you do is worthwhile , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Benef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Lin@@ ke@@ d@@ In , both with Conver@@ cent and G@@ lin@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot;
investors gain yields when their portfolio companies run well . companies run well when employees are going to use and engaged .
if the Analytics tools promise from third parties to increase commitment and deployment of employees , it is no wonder to find support .
data on the employee &apos;s employees are important to experts of the workplace culture .
but the data is useless if the car@@ et@@ akers of a company does not take action .
in fact , if a company asks employees after your feedback , it may have expect@@ ation that it is on the way .
and if the change doesn &apos;t come fast enough , or not at all , this can bre@@ ach dec@@ ei@@ ves and employees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are asking for 4.000 suggestions , you must be willing to have 4.000 talks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at Business Management company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen the company focused on collecting data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you are not following , ask yourself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you concern yourself ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and if you don &apos;t have to worry , why should I ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Madison Re@@ ed , who now passes monthly collabor@@ ators now , was able to initi@@ ate measures on the same day if a problem is reported on G@@ lin@@ t , thus saving .
and after collecting feedback from fruity employees , it was due to the speed of decision @-@ making and the quality of communication , capable of organizing several teams within the company and to add a communication training to tackle the problems .
at Ruby Tuesday , the company always gives new insights into the employees , and it hopes for a long term that leads to a better relationship of workers in a sector that is known for high sales .
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose man , &quot; Vit@@ rano said .
&quot; and if you lose people , you will lose customers too .
and if you lose client , you will lose companies .
the N@@ CAA sol@@ ves the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the Bru@@ ges
it is starting at 23 o &apos;clock when a lot of U@@ CL@@ A foot@@ ball@@ ers are talking on one side of the new exercise fields in the campus .
some have drawn up their tri@@ cot@@ ts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team this un@@ occupied minutes represent a lunch break .
players who are enrolled in the summer courses will return after the three @-@ hour exercise to their finishing tests before they return to the Water@@ man Football Center next morning at 6 : 30 p.m .
&quot; that &apos;s for the guys the next three days a real Tre@@ m@@ mühle , &quot; said Bru@@ ges @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before Monday to Tuesday .
the N@@ CAA elimin@@ ates two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the burden of players and it has actually extended their days - at least to the final on Friday .
therefore , the first three training courses of the U@@ CL@@ A should begin at 19 : 15 o &apos;clock in order to meet the already packed schedule of the player .
the compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bru@@ ges moved to the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six playing times in West@@ wood practical exercises .
in the course of August 18 exercises you should be able to do exercises . 20 before the start of formal preparations for their pre@@ lu@@ de against Texas A &amp; M in September .
MOR@@ A said that he adds to the N@@ CAA support rules , even if they add a further point to the players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we lay this enormous strain on three or four days on it , and it is very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they just put it , they plac@@ ements continue , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think when we come to Saturday and we have more time , it &apos;s really great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U@@ CL@@ A will end up its practices as soon as the camp is completed , which is covered with foot@@ prints from a adjacent car park and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the elevated park , which is already exposed to foot@@ balls , no light task .
Bru@@ ins players will occupy the hotel from this weekend but Mor@@ a gives up that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; said Mor@@ a .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far to think that people can rent there a room where you can set up a exercise there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the video footage of an exercise , it is a fairly good deal .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces to parking lot 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
I am not too much worried about this .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts in combat against counter@@ feit news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with fal@@ tering orders to third parties and their results under the original contribution , this is the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of its efforts to combat so @-@ called f@@ ake news .
the company said in an opinion on his website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to detect possible fal@@ si@@ ders and to send them to fac@@ tor@@ ship check out of the original article .
Facebook was critic@@ ized as one of the main share points for so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ News , many of which believe that they have also influenced US presidential elections in 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the problem has become a big political issue in Europe , and the French voters will be punished with false stories in May , and Germany will not succeed in removing the social media networks as they fail to remove h@@ asser@@ al post@@ ings as before the elections there in September . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate explanation in German that I started to test the new facts review in the US , France , the Netherlands and Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; besides the knowledge , those stories of fac@@ tor@@ ment@@ ors third parties want to be addressed , people want to read more about what they read and share , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sara Su , product manager for Facebook news in one blog . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that Facebook continues to report his feature on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; link @-@ related article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and working on other changes to his news feed to reduce false news . &quot; &quot; &quot;
creating a comic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his younger past the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a sque@@ eze music video and was a si@@ p hole for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in 1970 &apos;s and 1980 .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from its cozy seat at the ir@@ l River valley in K@@ ent and is now for inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a mop@@ l@@ ari@@ ous Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a pre@@ ference for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it is so beautiful to look at the manuscript from someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scot@@ ney . Isaac hand@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ pon@@ y May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Green@@ berg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des based on an archive : he wrote in 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he was un@@ exp@@ ec@@ tedly emotion@@ ally .
&quot; I only re@@ acted on the thumb@@ print on the side of a letter , who was written by a double player in the 1700 &apos;s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says .
&quot; this is his thumb@@ print !
and letters still smell to smoke , for at that time a fire was kind@@ led because of light .
for anyone who lives up to 300 years later , the smell has a effect than it would be for himself .
Ah , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England , and almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : &quot; I have given my welcome drink a little over@@ rated &quot; ) this is all too beautiful to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days to explore the Vic@@ tor@@ ian &quot; new &quot; castle , to study the archives and to study the many treasures and curi@@ os@@ ities of the castle , such as the mounted hy@@ ena heads over the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the dit@@ ch .
he wander@@ ed through the grounds and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscape gro@@ wers , fer@@ ries and sometimes also with the artists , which worked on the illustrations of his book .
then , at night he drank &quot; Whis@@ key , and began to write . &quot;
the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown since the National Trust received full access in 2006 , when the last Er@@ bin Elizabeth Hus@@ sey died .
when Rho@@ des arrived in a decade later , the employees began to worry about the archive , which he said as &quot; hundreds of years in which ar@@ ist@@ o@@ cr@@ ats said &quot; Oh , put it on the attic . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; di@@ aries , letters from the time of the English Emp@@ ires , maps depicting what had said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you could think that country conflicts would be boring , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but she was a bir@@ ch to fight for the two families . &quot; &quot; &quot;
guys , let everything go ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to take a wider base into the English history , among them &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which leaves a man who built the newly built castle to join the pe@@ asant view of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a record of an u@@ pro@@ ar which occurred in 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book entitled &apos; Kn@@ igh@@ tly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , says Rho@@ des .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pe@@ as@@ an@@ try began in this area and I thought , an insur@@ rection was a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the two are connected ? &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - as &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , who told the history of the Jesu@@ it patented seven years during the English Reformation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; , depicted in which the s@@ mu@@ g@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ rell , presented in the 18th century , filled his own fun@@ eral , filled a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was excav@@ ated only years later when his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) .
the Dar@@ rel@@ ls are Rho@@ des &apos;s favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gent@@ lemen seemed to be quite a g@@ aun@@ er , always making debts and spending money for things they could not afford .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other generations of Dar@@ rell @-@ men qu@@ en@@ ched their debt crises by un@@ married old women - I imagine them as a he@@ ap of well @-@ looking guys , with a talent to promote inheritance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the end of his approach in the castle , Rho@@ des on the search for other unique scre@@ am experiences
he has brought a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about E@@ lä@@ mer@@ ma@@ ki , the site of a San@@ at@@ orio from the early 20th century , which has since been returned from nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says .
it was like : &quot; Oh , now I have to be ready again with the dam@@ ned life . &quot;
campaign started : over 300 years old Mari@@ b@@ bin lace in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the wra@@ pping of the 301 year old Mari@@ achi bands in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the City of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f launched its campaign to launch a new umbrella brand ( Rundschau with Thursday ) .
until Thursday , mayor Otto N@@ EU@@ HO@@ FF and his marketing team want to keep the logo and the slogan of Nelson Art@@ z .
at the end of August there will be a highlight of the campaign for a celebration on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; too beautiful for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ask the makers of action since yesterday on the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dor@@ fer Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we think ( of course ! ) not really , &quot; they write on their last updated website .
&quot; but we use this measure to gain your attention .
and to make clear that man@@ ches is better than it seems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; basically , we are convinced that we know as bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer citizens to know the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this action , it is more than just &quot; a logo and a slogan , it continues .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is true to form@@ ulate a all@@ ot@@ ted promise , one that gives the city a distinctive feature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
finally , they are in competition with other mun@@ icipalities .
the city of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f can put its new umbrella brand and the campaign .
military forms in Turkey - Earth &apos;s fear of the army
every year early August in Ankara of the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) over Pen@@ sion@@ ists and promoted in the officer cor@@ ps .
so also this week .
at first glance a normal procedure .
but nothing is routine in the Turkish armed forces a year after the coup attempt .
the meeting was not held in the building of the General Staff , as previously , but in the office of the Prime Minister .
under the chair@@ manship of the government , the leaders of the government as well as the Minister for Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs .
that was the number of civilians in the Y@@ AS .
the government pul@@ ls the re@@ ins in the military .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar Chief of Staff to Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office but the commander of the army , the Air Force and the Navy have been depos@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the failed coup , Erdogan has fired 169 the 326 gener@@ als and Admir@@ als .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged connection to the movement of exile @-@ Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , Erdogan as a wire break .
against 4@@ 86 people who have been involved directly at the coup attempt , will be negoti@@ ated in Ankara since this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the day after the coup Erdogan called Erdogan as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; present gift &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to completely clean the armed forces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but does Erdogan really have the army in a grip ?
at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article with the heading &quot; Un@@ rav@@ ages in the military headquarters . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in general staff there are concerns of an increasing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the army , which manif@@ ests itself in the abol@@ ition of the head@@ case of Sol@@ dat@@ ors , wrote the newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Grand @-@ cleaner in the army and the security forces certainly continues .
in mid @-@ July , Erdogan sent a further 73@@ 95 state serving , among them 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers .
in doing so , Erdogan seemed to be the military .
the gener@@ als were used earlier than the country &apos;s real masters .
three times , they slip on appeal to their role as gu@@ ardi@@ ans of the sec@@ ular stat@@ ute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after his election victory in 2002 , Erdogan urged the power of the military step to step back , not least in appeal to the reform of the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
former officers say Erdogan is by targeted a Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a name was not so @-@ called officer , who sought asylum from persecution against persecution in foreign countries , the Turkish army will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full extrem@@ ists and sal@@ af@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if such a development , NATO could not leave Nato close .
there is no doubt in the Alliance after the inf@@ lic@@ ences of the Turkish army .
the leaders and operations skills are &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; says Nato diplom@@ ats .
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , President Donald Tr@@ ump , quoted by the media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he sees to lower the legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter rules for author@@ ization of vis@@ as for temporary employment and limitations for families @-@ oriented visa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new rules are proposed by the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill will be deb@@ ated in the two chambers of the congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty and save $ billion for tax pay@@ ers and will do this by how the US will change the way citizens of other countries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Green Cards &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent the chain migration and replacing the current system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this new candidate procedure will come to the candidates who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit from our economy &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Tr@@ ump , quoted by the American media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ministry wants to beam track for racing platform
over the past few months over the future of the racing platform was disp@@ uted - now it is expected to go quickly .
before the end of the year it is scheduled to be built on the mar@@ ge@@ odes , on which the tourist bus drives , built .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to secure the future of the road to secure the long term , according to the traffic ministry , construction work will start on the track again this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the decision to continue to order and renov@@ ate the Ilmenau @-@ race track , the country is particularly important for tourism major connection , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared Traffic State Secretary Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Erfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost of maintenance of the track will amount to about 2.5 million euros .
from this sum , the country will take 75 percent .
the contract , based on the basis of the shuttle , is to be ordered in the future of the country , is currently finally voted , S@@ üh@@ l stated .
the Ministry and the South @-@ Thur@@ ing@@ ia are the operator of the technical details already .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that the road@@ map used for vehicles and quality standards are negoti@@ ated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the proposed contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
thus the race @-@ sti@@ ff@@ led shuttle will be ordered in December 2017 .
the race @-@ sti@@ ff@@ g shuttle is a popular railway connection between the railway stations of Ilmenau and the race .
during the course of a pilot plant in the past months , whether the circuit is used sufficient for many people to order them again in the future .
the circuit is also in parts very pe@@ eled .
the rise of sex robots is real , and we should be concerned
just as you thought it can &apos;t be crazy in 2017 , a new report about technological developments in the field of sex robots .
yes , actually .
sex robots are currently a big deal .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ) ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , Emer@@ itus Professor for Robotics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of FR@@ R , we must start to take their rise seriously .
customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pp@@ le and the type of fing@@ ern@@ a@@ gel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people make fun of it , but the company will deliver a lot of it , and we will see them much more common , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Shar@@ key when publishing his new report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern S@@ exports have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicon , which feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the user can also adapt his robot according to his beliefs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and choose everything from the eye color of the robot through the shape of the ni@@ pp@@ le to type or the colour of his fing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is still wor@@ rying , as many robots have the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; person@@ alities &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which would look like an Step@@ ford @-@ wife progres@@ sively . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern S@@ exports have developed to robots with a silicone skin .
for example , the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot makes it possible for example to adapt their robots to the properties they find appe@@ aling , e.g. z@@ apping .
and then there &apos;s the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold sex robot developed by True Compan@@ ion with pre@@ programmed person@@ alities such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which tran@@ scri@@ bed the impression of z@@ apping and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with a &quot; advent@@ u@@ rous person . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as good as possible &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the website of True Compan@@ ion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
during the day , she also has its m@@ oods - just like real people !
it may be tired , be fixed to conversation , or it can be &quot; in the mood ! &quot;
there are many wor@@ rying aspects of this rise of sex rob@@ bers - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ mis@@ sive traits of rape , if one step towards Fri@@ gi@@ d ( means here : re@@ lu@@ ct@@ ant ) Far@@ rah is going on , troubled one of the most .
on his site True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator , but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men then have no Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; it &apos;s called on the website .
however , these Sex Robot are not only a fet@@ ish or just another sex toy .
their emergence and their increasing refin@@ ement indicate a slightly dar@@ ker and deep in our culture , to retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards sex with submission to sex with submission as optional en@@ core .
most men will of course do not keep sex robots , and while the FR@@ R noted its rising popularity , they remain provisional in the edge of consumer culture .
but what tran@@ se@@ eth from the mar@@ g@@ inal zones can be in relation to the spirit of time in which we live , very instruc@@ tive .
and many people are not strange or ins@@ ulting until it gives them permission to them .
there is a certain over@@ l@@ apping that this highly developed sex robot in a time emerge , in which the rights of women worldwide are threatened , in which there is a president in the White House who has be@@ aming women sexually attacked .
the most awesome aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the hand@@ maid &apos; ) are not the graphic images , the ind@@ ol@@ ated body and the e@@ och@@ ens eyes , but how realistic this vision works .
Gilead is a jump , but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap .
the goal behind these sex robots is to produce a physical simil@@ arity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( though with por@@ po@@ ar propor@@ tions ) .
their gro@@ wers want to feel human , that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but , to the point , when it comes to their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; person@@ alities &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the robots are no real women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can &apos;t separate or go away from their companion .
they don &apos;t have a placement or background history , nothing that indicates independence or anything that could distur@@ b the imagination of total submission .
other words : they are counter@@ feit slaves .
or to express it in the language of 2017 : ma@@ ids
tr@@ um@@ ps great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney a ep@@ it@@ ome of healthy human mind
it has become a Bin@@ sen@@ sibility of the Tr@@ ump era , that the political spl@@ its , which have polarized US voters , also split families in small format .
around Christmas and Ern@@ est dan@@ k@@ fest there were newspapers in the USA newspapers with suggestions about how to deal with the hor@@ ror of dre@@ ad@@ ful relatives .
we are all committed to letting us put our filter bubbles .
less not@@ ices has been sum@@ med up the power of tr@@ um@@ ps , families .
I mention this because my c@@ ousin , a left @-@ directed poet , who lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the rep@@ ublic@@ ans in our family who visited New York this week .
she re@@ minded me that the unit may have a powerful effect against a common enemy .
with tr@@ ump in the White House each one knows them , including the rep@@ ubli@@ can relationship , with which she had fought for decades because of politics , suddenly and quite strange at the same side .
to the dining table , this is certainly a good thing , but it falls to me in another context that this also brings significant risks .
the left was strengthened by tr@@ ump , but the ent@@ ailing effect of his presidency has the power to push us all right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when we speak of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and tr@@ ump , we refer to the cre@@ ep@@ y possibility that us no longer get rid of his M@@ ittens of one day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , there is another long @-@ term scenario , in which tr@@ ump rep@@ ublic@@ ans of the right wing , norm@@ alizes , &quot; suddenly appear in comparison with his standards as the ep@@ it@@ ome of mer@@ its .
I find myself from an active nost@@ al@@ gic version of Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , who fell 14 % of income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax returns ) - both in comparison to tr@@ ump in fact occur as a very mild crime .
if Tr@@ ump is going , the next candidate of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans must be only mentally healthy in order to qualify as un@@ measur@@ able improvement .
when my c@@ ousin was in the city , we brought our children to the car@@ ou@@ sel in Central Park , the largest of the car@@ ou@@ sel of the New York Park@@ department , and the best three dollars you can spend in town if you don &apos;t need any caffeine .
the horses are huge , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all C@@ low@@ ns are bu@@ ggy and the animals are turning to look full of fear through their own shoulders - extrem@@ ly dark and the cli@@ matic music gives this in strange ways .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ ap@@ point : the views of high buildings will be old , the Sky@@ lines become familiar to provide much excitement , and the reality of the city is not just a dream .
five @-@ five years later , and I &apos;m still not over the day , when I found that Swiss Cottage is no Swiss cottage in fact - the topic Pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not one of the big roundabout in the north of London .
the Central Park @-@ Kar@@ us@@ sell is still a strange magical experience , as here two years old , a 11 @-@ year old and two women in the 40 @-@ s can go on it and all have a great time .
if I could rate this car@@ ou@@ sel , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one has asked about it .
on the other hand , I was forced to rate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale from one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card .
in the coffee house on the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to get the evaluation with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the shop@@ per .
this does not only lead to a slow@@ down of what is supposed to be a neutral exchange but also practices pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation in which no need is required .
the poor woman in the department store was ap@@ olo@@ getic , while I tired the experience I had to submit my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us moved to hospital with chest pain from prison
for the second time Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for a hospital visit .
last year he was transferred to the hospital for the treatment of s@@ lei@@ ghs to hospital , according to a case in his cell .
Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to first death sentence due to Mor@@ se after an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp early in the early hours of Valentine &apos;s Day in 2013 by calling them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ toria on it .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed he held his girlfriend for a no@@ c@@ tur@@ nal in@@ tru@@ der who hidden in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention , this time against the six @-@ year prison sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , of which they say , be sigh@@ ted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the National Court of prosec@@ ut@@ ors said they would rise in the Supreme Court of South Africa and the claim can be heard this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us is in danger that his sentence is increased to 15 years when the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
as a farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools , the quad@@ rants from F@@ athers and E@@ pf@@ en@@ hofen were released to vac@@ ations and in the secondary schools .
three of the students will go to high school , four at the secondary school .
Schul@@ er Angel@@ ika S@@ itte greeted the parents and representatives of the public in the civil house Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ hofen on Tuesday evening .
the 29 pupils of the four classes under the direction of Sophia Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der chose a young eagle , which grows in the chicken yard , but then put away into freedom .
as a result , the m@@ lower Sch@@ ar led a musical with the title &quot; The Eagle in the Chicken hof . &quot;
farmer Arnold found a strange egg and left it out of his chickens .
instead of a chicken legs , a small eagle came forth .
but the hope of making a chicken spread out of him , the eag@@ les spread its wings onto a high mountain .
after that the classes were three and four in the study of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken dance .
the h@@ ens danced with the young go@@ ck@@ les , the cylinder , around the bet .
the Eagle &apos;s Stand for Integration , said Schul@@ er Angel@@ ika S@@ itte .
the young man is different from the other young ( ch@@ icks ) , but belonged to that .
he will never be like a chicken .
his destiny is to be free .
they wished each quad@@ rat @-@ chan@@ ger that he feels in his new school .
it was followed by than@@ ksgiving to colleagues , the former school leader Michael Müller , who jumps back with sen@@ g@@ eries , and the parents are represented .
the Kü@@ ken@@ zeit is now over , explained class teacher Sophia Schumacher .
she leave her pupils after two years of education only very ung@@ ers , because it was a really great time .
finally , they can rely on the four rings .
finally , all students will end a song from summer time and summer time .
so the children broke great joy .
eight first dealers have already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians have been arrested for illegal camping in Greece
two Bulg@@ arians have been imprisoned for illegal camp in Greece , quoted by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted on television .
on the morning of 1 August , the police arrested a group of illegal people , including the two Bulg@@ arians .
on the same day , they were released , while an investigation is underway .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported B@@ TV that Bulg@@ arians had been released later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Greek authorities have spar@@ ked control over the free camping and place every one who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose , significantly fin@@ ances . &quot; &quot; &quot;

software update for diesel vehicles : what the people now have to know
how exactly does the software update take place ?
will diesel drivers have to participate in the action ?
an overview of the most important questions and answers .
at the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the Volkswagen Group have offered software upgrades for a total of around 5,@@ 3 million cars .
you should improve the emission performance from the Euro 5 emission standard and in some Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ Diesel or worse are excluded .
Anja S@@ met@@ anin of ACE Auto Club Europe are ass@@ ess@@ ments :
is the new action mandatory ?
no , the edited software updates are voluntary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the compulsory updates previously apply only to the vehicles that have che@@ ating software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their retro@@ fitting has been arranged by the Federal Office of the Bundes@@ amt ( KBA ) .
how and when are customers informed about updates ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; manufacturers have announced a quick implementation in the coming months , but is not yet an exact date . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Daimler informed us to write every person concerned .
if an inspection is due anyway , it will be done within the frame .
how long will the change equipment be drawn ?
&quot; difficult to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ anin .
it depends on the commitment of the manufacturers as well as from political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for we have seen it voluntarily do not have the car manufacturers at the subject of the environment so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long should this update last ?
the upgrade itself could only take three to four hours in the workshop .
time elabor@@ ate it could be to get an appointment .
what do drivers do , who do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the Volkswagen Group ?
the ACE reveals to wait .
presumably , foreign manufacturers would prefer , such as S@@ met@@ anin .
is a massive price reduction of Euro @-@ 4 cars threat@@ ens ?
the ACE does not fear that .
but just in the regions , where driver is threat@@ ening .
in rural areas , there is no value losses for older diesel .
the ACE reveals that you are still waiting for sale .
ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center @-@ Award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glam@@ orous events in Washington .

we make the city worth living
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ ler &apos;s Municipal Buil@@ der , goes back to retirement next year .
the site is already written - suitable candidates are rare .
for 31 years , W@@ acker Urban Buil@@ der is the master builder .
and the work still makes it great fun , as he convey@@ s in the press conference .
he reports of varied , but also demanding tasks , waiting for his followers .
at the same time , no application has fulfilled the requirement profile .
the town is looking for the next time a architect or architect .
this is meant - in regard of the regular canc@@ elling time - still enough time for a revision .
since Has@@ lach has func@@ tioned for the Administ@@ rative Association as a sub @-@ mining authority , the applicants must present appropriate down@@ s .
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
if they could no longer fill this , the citizens would have to travel to Offen@@ burg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the town is important to the city and himself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ acker that tells of a good company climate and good mood between authority and citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in more than 30 years in office , some important projects have accumulated , along with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city worth living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure about the construction and its employees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future , varied projects are on the agenda : the re@@ shaping of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a Are@@ as and the Dutch park of the Netherlands .
the Kin@@ ley bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the st@@ adi@@ onal restoration is still subject .
the latter alone will be@@ have around 1,5 million euros in be@@ ech , &quot; when we do it right , &quot; says W@@ acker .
&quot; all in all , great tasks are waiting for my followers .
the work here is fun . &quot;
design is present for a city master of big playing space .
with Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s own construc@@ hof and gar@@ dener , it can be re@@ acted flexi@@ bly flexi@@ bly .
&quot; you can move much , &quot; says W@@ acker , and the creation of green spaces will often be lob@@ ber@@ ed by citizens and visitors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as the old part of the old town is under monument protection , it is important to have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to have an eye for it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Neu@@ builds are approved , emphas@@ ises the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; out@@ going city master &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
anyway , the Stadt@@ bau@@ master carries high responsibility anyway .
he is the builder , &quot; at the end all things are going on my table . &quot;
taking care and coordination , he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neum@@ ai@@ er ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been there for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( Tief@@ bau ) already for 15 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even though his successor remains long , W@@ acker : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &apos;re looking for someone who really identi@@ fies and stay with the job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
continu@@ ity is not only important for a good enterprise , but also for the further design of the city .
if you want Roland W@@ acker , a completed study of studies or Bachelor of Architecture , according to information from the town of Has@@ lach , can have a degree in architecture and knowledge of knowledge in the fields of construction and construction planning .
the municipal office underground and deep @-@ construction , building planning , cru@@ el@@ ess@@ ness , building of urban property , municipal farm with building yard and city authorities including monuments .
bicycle included on pipes : blocked in the ground
according to the police , previously unknown offen@@ ders had thrown the blue bicycle from the train track in the Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) on the lines .
these were badly damaged that the her@@ ed@@ ding freight train had to be stopped .
investig@@ ators go out of two male offen@@ ders and search for them since night .
near the scene there were witnesses of a pink sco@@ oter and a bike ride was observed .
&quot; this goes far beyond a gen@@ ius , &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokesperson Christoph Pos@@ ch to the AP@@ A .
the perpet@@ rators have brought themselves in great danger and at risk of train traffic .
besides the damage to the Lo@@ k and the plant and the costs for rail transport , P@@ ön@@ alen &apos;s rail customers may also come to the perpet@@ rators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; overall , the speaker said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damages were fixed on Friday afternoon , the rail traffic on the southern route could be conducted without disability .
almost ten people were Friday afternoon , two of them entered the traffic .
goods did not fall out , however , they had delay .
according to Ö@@ BB &apos;s speaker , Christoph Pos@@ ch had to be replaced approximately 200 meters .
isol@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help to alle@@ vi@@ ate IB@@ D ( infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory bo@@ wel disease )
red meat and chocolate can sound like a night@@ mare for your digest@@ ive system .
but a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products could alle@@ vi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory bo@@ wel diseases .
the incur@@ able condition that affects approximately 1.3 million in the US and in Great Britain , causing mag@@ nets , recur@@ ring or bloody diar@@ rhe@@ a , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
while those affected are usually advised to alle@@ vi@@ ate meat and dairy products in order to alle@@ vi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers found the amino acid tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an of proteins to develop immune cells which promote a toler@@ ant intest@@ ine .
the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Colonna , explained that immune cells in the gut are pat@@ rolling to ensure that dam@@ aging micro@@ bes that hide in the body , do not penet@@ rate into the body .
cells that are capable of dis@@ solving inflammation , are offset by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without dam@@ aging sensitive tissues .
if the balance is too far towards inflammation , it can result in an anti @-@ infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory bo@@ wel disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in experiments I found that a kind of tolerance subsi@@ dy immune cell is present in mice that bear a certain bacter@@ ium in their in@@ wards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the bacter@@ ium uses tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an - one of the blocks of proteins - to trigger the image of the cells .
Professor Colonna said : &quot; we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ illus Cru@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ osis , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an the mice had in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and one to tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an rich diet are toler@@ ant , less anti @-@ infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory bo@@ wel mi@@ ths , if the same system also work for people .
the Post@@ doctoral candidate Dr. Lu@@ isa Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan has sought out a kind of immun@@ cell that she found out that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe that was not accommod@@ ated separately .
it assumed that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ omes of mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , which normally live in the gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract .
the mice of mice were sequ@@ enced DNA @-@ sequ@@ enced and six bacterial species were found in mice with immune cells , but without them missing in mice .
mice had grown up in a ster@@ ile environment so that they lack@@ ed an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ om and they did not have developed this type of immune cells , and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and immune cells .
in order to understand how the bacteria increased to the immune system , the researchers accepted L. Cru@@ ter@@ i in a liquid and then over@@ led small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ripe immune cells , which were ins@@ ulated by mice .
the immune cells developed to toler@@ able cells .
when the active component was cleaned from the liquid , it turned out to be a by@@ product of tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an met@@ abolic , which is known as In@@ dol @-@ 3 @-@ lac@@ tic acid .
if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an in the diet of mice , the number of these cells grew by around 50 percent , but if the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han@@ ces were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan declared that people have the same toler@@ ant @-@ promoting cells like mice , and that most of us may protect L. Cru@@ ter@@ i in our gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract .
it is not known whether Tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as with mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an were found in people with anti @-@ infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory bo@@ wel disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote , as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
potentially can lead high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han@@ ces in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i to an extension of this population . &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United is committed to N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes after the mid@@ fiel@@ der on Wednesday evening had his debut on S@@ amp@@ dor@@ ia .
the 40 million pounds of signature from Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last season game before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday , and impres@@ sing as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira according to will .
however , M@@ atic was excluded from the prepar@@ atory Asia tour of the blues and abolished only 45 minutes to improve M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , that he had to improve before the beginning of the Premier League season .
&quot; he needs time but his experience , intelligence , a gen@@ ius in the way he thinks - he thinks of football , &quot; M@@ our@@ in@@ ho said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will help him to be ready earlier than later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lind@@ el@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Luk@@ ak@@ u also started in the avi@@ va Stadium when M@@ our@@ in@@ ho form@@ ulated its start @-@ XI for the start of the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Independent revealed this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho did another new eng@@ agements , but he insist@@ ed that the club has already had a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fantastic job &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; three of his four priority eng@@ agements begin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; three out of four , I thank the club , &quot; he added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four , but they gave great effort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the U.S. plane manufacturer Boeing has drawn the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner to the sky .
the pilots flew from Seattle in the US state of Washington , but drawing in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state of Michigan and moved in the form of a Dream@@ liner across the USA , which are several thousand kilometres .
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar screens the shape of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole thing was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had already made such ads earlier .

since Martin Schulz led the party , the fundament@@ ally changed .
since then , the employees of the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ House with growing dism@@ iss@@ ors are watching the events in the SPD @-@ ruled provincial capit@@ als .
what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described in the approach .
there were deep env@@ elop@@ es .
and one after another .
following the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the Federal CDU sees a general signal against co@@ al@@ itions of the SPD and the Gre@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this once more : red @-@ green is simply not to be reliable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said CDU @-@ Secretary Peter Tau@@ ber the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the surprising fra@@ ction of a Green M@@ EPs took the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) in a serious crisis .
five months before the country code , his red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ voice majority to the opposition from CDU and F@@ DP .
the Green @-@ President Michael Kell@@ ner encouraged her to return to the Green Party of Green , El@@ ke T@@ ests to return their mandate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the surrender of the CDU means a clear for@@ gery of the voters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests must immediately return their mandate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Federal President and election campaign of the Green Party in Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that may all not be true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he sigh@@ s an SPD const@@ itu@@ ency when the new hi@@ ob@@ s@@ message reaches the party central on Friday afternoon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Weil , the SPD @-@ Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands for the CDU without its own government majority after the attacks of the green pu@@ ties .
it is the preliminary highlight of a series of large and small crises in SPD country associations .
and nobody knows what comes next .
the failure began with the un@@ exp@@ ec@@ tedly defeat at the Saarland Choice in March .
a blue eye , no more , cal@@ med down the comra@@ des of his time .
everything will be different after the elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia .
that was then even worse - and everything was much worse .
the SPD &apos;s defeat in Kiel brought the SPD to the diving , the Düsseldorf @-@ Ple@@ k@@ ite brought the party smoothly .
the comra@@ des caught up again in the weeks thereafter .
then , when they had just had new courage , the G @-@ 20 came from Hamburg .
and the next low@@ case came with him .
mayor O@@ laf Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD country , lost his Nim@@ bus on that weekend , because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city burned .
and because in the crisis communications he made pretty much wrong to do what you can do wrong .
since then , Sch@@ olz fights for political survival .
now also Stephan Weil .
because of the VW @-@ exhaust gas and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Lower Sax@@ on Minister has already been in criticism for some time .
mi@@ ese ren@@ dering values came added .
nevertheless , or perhaps just because in recent weeks , because in the past weeks , he was getting stronger in the League of acc@@ ents .
the fun@@ eral of the former mayor of Hanover , to expand its power in Berlin , was not yet hidden in the field of Martin Schulz .
they let him give him a stabili@@ zation of the party , because they spoke of the party .
now the exact opposite may occur .
in doing so , because of the part@@ isan internal , the Sax@@ on Green has no gu@@ ilt .
and Schulz were not at all .
now , the comra@@ des ende@@ av@@ our to keep your own ranks closed .
their anger appe@@ als to the Gre@@ ens , and above all to the revol@@ ting par@@ liament@@ ar@@ ier@@ in T@@ v@@ ests .
&quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democracy , such as Mrs. T@@ v@@ ests face their own career path over the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , head of the parliamentary vote in the SPD parliamentary group , the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
Mrs. T@@ v@@ ests is not elected as direct can@@ di@@ dat@@ in , but on the country list of the Sax@@ on Green parliament , the lower Sax@@ on de@@ pu@@ ties .
the logical consequence would be that it returns its mandate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD parliamentary group , compl@@ ains an &quot; un@@ democratic maneu@@ ver . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the voters four years ago was clear : the people have made Stephan Weil as prime minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower Saxony as top candidate in the parliamentary elections to the R@@ ND . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the personal career of a future CDU faction is fal@@ si@@ fied the election outcome , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he asked to clari@@ fy the background .
I want to know if there has been more or there will be further additions by the CDU Nieders@@ achsen .
convey@@ ing funding for Ort@@ is@@ ern III
those who want to be renovated in the years can get support from the country .
in addition , Mr. Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representatives of Ste@@ g city development held on Wednesday in sensation .
at the beginning of the information event Sch@@ ind@@ ler gave again a review of the events so far .
since 1991 there is in sens@@ ational san@@ itation areas .
at that time , in the San@@ itation region I from 1991 to 2004 , the State of Baden @-@ Württemberg has taken over two thirds of the total funding amount .
in the renovation area II from 2005 to 2016 , the supplement was at least 60 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , the previous sands are a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; successful project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - it is finally important to promote the interior development , and not only new construction areas . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on April 4 , I received the information from the Regierung@@ sprä@@ si@@ dium Karlsruhe to give it a rehabilitation area III .
the sum sum of 8@@ 33 333 euros , of which 500 000 Euro would come from the country , the rest of the community sens@@ ory .
how is a sanit@@ ising area now created ?
you will continue to investig@@ ate Sch@@ ind@@ ler , where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are .
it also plays a role of interest in the planned area at all interest .
if necessary , the borders may then be shifted again .
on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Keller presented the contents of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Federation of the Federation where the renov@@ ations would then be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
core of the programme include prec@@ in@@ it@@ isation of inner stones , the improvement of living and working rati@@ os and preserv@@ ation of infrastructure .
the measures would be objective , that means to be held per plot .
the rehabilitation area would then finally be defined as a by@@ laws .
the transport period for the feed @-@ up period has been running since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 20@@ 26 .
until September this year would only be performed once again , in the frame of those involved in the rehabilitation area .
in November or December , as possible the pro@@ positi@@ onal sign is to be carried out , in order to begin with the renovation in the coming year .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann subsequently explained that every Commun@@ e had to conduct the forec@@ asted pre@@ ab investigations .
it is about assess the urban mis@@ states , and to decide when it becomes sof@@ ten@@ ed and in which scope .
for the particular plot it will also be a document registered in the basic register .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come again after feelings and make a picture of the situation , she promised .
Got@@ zel emphas@@ ized , an essential success factor for the project is the participation of the participants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , there will be quest@@ ionn@@ aires will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and will be completed by the end of the summer holidays . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the yellow quest@@ ionnaire is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; building and ground@@ breaking &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; with which it goes among others to build the structural condition and the remedi@@ ation views . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the grey quest@@ ionnaire , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; household and housing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; data can be made to size , part@@ itions and residents of a housing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; operation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is just filling when building offices are operated in the building . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Got@@ zel proved to be aware that a solid quest@@ ionnaire is not at the same time a motion for convey@@ ing agents .
the re@@ building measures are also not eligible .
Sch@@ ind@@ ler still emphas@@ ised that the distribution of convey@@ ing agents after the &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ e principle &quot; function - who first comes first , ma@@ c first .
no funding that can be reserved for later . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the end , photos of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ort@@ is@@ ern II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were shown to make a restoration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tasty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
British inventor sets himself a micro@@ chip to move with a hand movement in the house and car
a British inventor is the first in the country , who is equipped with a micro@@ chip , so that he can open his door , entering his office and even start his own movement .
Steven Nor@@ th@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thum@@ b and fore@@ finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simpli@@ fy their lives with technology by the company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he has joined Dr. Ge@@ off Watson , an advis@@ ory an@@ aes@@ thes@@ ist in the Royal H@@ amp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the im@@ plant procedure is carried out after medical standards .
the technology re@@ sembles a cats and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and takes only 30 seconds .
the company of Mr. Nor@@ th@@ am also wants to change the locks on houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , all for an additional charge of £ 300 per lock .
the married father of one has now built both at home and his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the wheel .
the advertising costs of the White House cost thousands of tax@@ pay@@ ers .
the White House &apos;s decision to fly a marine helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event that raised the American production last month , costs tax@@ pay@@ ers according to the TIM@@ E magazine , up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars .
the green @-@ white S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the core of the event on July 17th at the White House with American construction programs .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of all 50 countries .
built in Connec@@ tic@@ ut , a helicopter from Maine , a fire@@ man from Wisconsin and a forkli@@ ft truck was exhibited in Mississippi .
the Military Office of the White House asked the presence of helicop@@ ters in a frag@@ mentary order or Fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , after the recordings of the Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for operation of the helicopter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just wanted you to be aware , because it is an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 on the eve of the event to its su@@ peri@@ ors , the deputy nav@@ al man@@ de@@ ur for aviation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the message shows that the helicopter arrived on July 17th at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning on the South La@@ wn , and so long stayed until the lawn was vac@@ ated between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 this evening .
note that , if the flight depart@@ ing from the White House , the note should be delayed , due to the limitation of service hours a second crew would be needed .
the original flight &apos;s crew was during the helicopter , while security personnel remained at the plane during the period during the period .
from the recordings of the TIM@@ E we did not realise whether a second flight &apos;s crew was required .
the Hatch Act offers to use federal authorities to use state property for political purposes .
dat@@ as@@ ets show that H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 has asked if the event could harm purpose .
&quot; a question that we asked was if it was a violation of the Hatch acts and we were informed about that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the commander .
&quot; sounds as if you are closed , &quot; the deputy commander answered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the event &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was designated by the White House as an official event and would not be covered by the Hatch Act . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but official events have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the President gave a bre@@ ach for the reform of the health reform that was underway in the Senate , and he prop@@ ag@@ ated efforts to preserve the government regulations .
the use of aircraft that is known as Marine One or Air Force One , from politically advant@@ ageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon .
presi@@ dents are obliged to use them for the journey .
but their use only for a photo @-@ surgery is unusual .
Tr@@ ump introduced an investigation in February , when the presidential plane was in front of his first campaign r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and its Twitter account is fully benef@@ iting from its predecessor by its predecessor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House is enth@@ r@@ alled by the show &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made In America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the products from all 50 states , produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the deputy head of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 cre@@ ws often lead training flights in the area around Washington and South La@@ wn through to depos@@ e US President in the White House with precise po@@ inters .
when Tr@@ ump was in Germany at the G20 summit in Germany , H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 led to the White House 58 training courses .
the flight for the &quot; Made in America &quot; event attracted at the training requirements of the flight &apos;s crew for the month , said an official .
&quot; &quot; &quot; hel@@ ik@@ op@@ ter units flew in addition 11 hours to this day for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non @-@ presidential support &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the White House said that the pay@@ ers were at the last for none of the other pro@@ ps that were presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky said that the company was not involved to put the helicopter in the South La@@ wn .
H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 does not maintain bud@@ get@@ ary drawings for the presidential journey , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to St@@ und@@ ent@@ ari@@ fen of the US Ministry of Defense for fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D replacement for the V@@ H @-@ 3D will be 24.@@ 380 USD per flight lesson .
records of the unit reck@@ on the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Navy Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual costs for the operation of the helicopter far lie under this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers based on estimates for the refund sets is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual funding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a R@@ AND study of 2015 , the funds for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs , but consider the costs of fuel , maintenance and contract .
at that time , the former spokes@@ man of the White House , Sean Sp@@ are , defended the use of the helicopter for the event .
&quot; the idea is to present things this week , which will be made in America , &quot; said Sp@@ are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I know that S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and the state of Connec@@ tic@@ ut are very proud to contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not even thousands of people depend on it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think like most Americans , we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment , for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
it is , of course , appropriate to highlight . &quot;
it was not clear if Tr@@ ump was inter@@ ag@@ ated with helicopter , when he entered his tour over the South La@@ wn , but he sat down in the seat &apos;s seat of a fire brig@@ ade .
in the White House Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and conf@@ essed with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky very good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the President , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have three of them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss before kne@@ eling task
the top leader of the second tennis court enters the runner @-@ up s@@ dor@@ fer S@@ V .
the TC blue @-@ Weiss Ne@@ uss occurs tomorrow at 11 : 00@@ h in Kiel when riding the Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer S@@ V .
despite the five games still f@@ law@@ less balance , the leader in the second tennis court has won the sense of reality .
team principal Mar@@ ius Z@@ ay has no respect for opponents .
&quot; this is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation .
just on the rear positions I find the crew very well . &quot;
for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer S@@ V mainly imports from the high North .
&quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even make reference to the Davis Cup .
and they are also strong in doubles , &quot; says Z@@ ay , with a view to Har@@ ri Hel@@ i@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andre Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören und Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas Bj@@ ar@@ hus ( all Denmark ) .
&quot; that &apos;s how hard for us .
you also need a good luck . &quot;
the Ne@@ uss@@ er team for the trip to the high north stands practically .
his debut for blue @-@ white might give maxim@@ e jan@@ vier .
if the Ch@@ allen@@ ger tournament is currently not able to enter the Bundesliga game at the Ch@@ allen@@ ger tournament , the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) won the tournament for his first use in this season .
the previously un@@ defeated Chil@@ ren Hans Pod@@ ellip@@ nik @-@ Castillo was yesterday with the White R@@ ank@@ el An@@ drei Vas@@ il@@ ev@@ ski at the ATP tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el at the ball .
it should be as well as Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ schul@@ p , Niel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and the Belgi@@ ans Julien C@@ agn@@ ina .
after his two victories on Sunday night against the club at the Al@@ ster , Má@@ té Val@@ k@@ z could once again put back into the team .
is enough for the 18 year old Hungary , who was the number one of the juni@@ ors - World Ranking in January 2016 , does not fill any one from the train@@ ee to Mar@@ ius Z@@ ay the Ka@@ der .
how America can harm O@@ MV
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; really happy Donald Tr@@ ump not worked as he put his signature under the law for deep@@ ening the sanctions against Russia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his h@@ ast , the law en@@ acted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; did the Congress packed a few &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ constitutional prec@@ epts &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels fo@@ amed the US advance .
after all , the design is to pun@@ ish European companies helping the Russians to build gas pi@@ pel@@ ines into the EU .
since then , investors of the local O@@ MV , co @-@ financed by other European companies , co @-@ financed by North Stream 2 , together with other European companies .
the dr@@ one is huge .
nevertheless , it was too early for estim@@ ating the consequences so the official statement of the oil company .
in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump himself would have to revi@@ ve the sanctions via an executive order .
twelve weapons are standing on him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press has been considered what the Group could fight off and which could really hurt him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nar@@ cos Season 3 trailer : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar the Cal@@ i Car@@ tel is caught in the center of heat from Net@@ fli@@ x
despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , the Pablo Es@@ co@@ bars Killer are un@@ revealed , the series of Net@@ fli@@ x is not yet over .
Staff@@ ing three and four were already confirmed by streaming service , the first received their first trailer and showed the latest vill@@ ains of the show .
with the third season , D@@ EA has directed her attention to the richest organization of drug traff@@ icking in the world : the Cal@@ i car@@ tel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; led by four powerful god@@ parents , they operate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a Fortune 500 company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only with more government bri@@ bes and violent actions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ guez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Damian Al@@ c@@ azar ) is the leader of the Car@@ tel , Miguel Rodri@@ guez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) commands the Mexican link , and Che@@ pe Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ ac@@ ote ) is located in New York .

play backwards : the city poses 46 kitchen@@ ware
the city organizes the K@@ ita @-@ Lunch again .
with fixed contact partners for the children and a assignment to the team .
in the urban kinder@@ garten the clock is turned back .
as of September 1 , the city of Kre@@ feld takes over the food supply in the urban kinder@@ garten facilities ( Kit@@ as ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , deputy head of the youth welfare service , this is good news : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were all very pleased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cooking is still out of house : a C@@ ater@@ er takes over this task and co@@ ols fresh air @-@ cooled .
the city runs in the area 46 day@@ care centres , in 44 children get a warm meal at lunch@@ time .
in the last Kit@@ a@@ year , 2800 children sat at the tables , and the need grows steadily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , not only children who will be taken care of 45 week@@ days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in K@@ ita &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the offer also applies in the 35 @-@ hour supervision of keeping children up to 14 . &quot;
46 Parti@@ al forces have heat the delivered food from the 1st of September : they offer the meals delivered , supplement it for salad , raw vegetables and fruit , por@@ tion@@ ing the meal individually , give food , rinse , clean the kitchen .
&quot; the employees are firmly associated with a K@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ ance .
the size - there are two groups as well as sevent@@ een troops - decides on the ho@@ ur@@ able circum@@ ference .
&quot; the kitchen hel@@ pers now belong to the K@@ ita @-@ Team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much more active and it is easier to implement ped@@ agog@@ ical concepts for Kit@@ eline . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is why it is : healthy food and cooking lessons .
&quot; children should help to prepare food . &quot;
direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is meaning@@ fully .
also for the children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have a well @-@ known force in K@@ ita , a person familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this continu@@ ity is important for the children .
the pur@@ ge of the K@@ ita @-@ rooms - so far the task of the kitchen ju@@ ices - will be handled in the future of special cleaning personnel .
this variation - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has also the charm that they put in price comparison between self @-@ gover@@ ning and external awar@@ ding to the city as the most economical solution , it is from the press office .
and this , although 46 partial forces are re@@ dis@@ continued .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours are not so strong at some 750 people in the education area , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elections can only be representative , if all members of the society , including women , play a role , said the Chief of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nicholas Hay@@ som , Head of the United Nations &apos;s mission , said that hundreds of women are can@@ di@@ li@@ de in the provinces of the provinces . three women can@@ di@@ cs for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of new registered voters are women .
&quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elections can only be representative and credi@@ ble if women participate in fully and involved in all parts of the election process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afghan elections for the provincial Council and the Presi@@ dential elections take place on April 5th .
the Taliban issued threats against an election process , which co@@ inci@@ des with the transition from international martial law to an advis@@ ory role .
this year , the elections for the first time will be peace@@ fully handed over by a demo@@ cr@@ atically elected government .
Hay@@ ner said , a strong role for women will intensi@@ fy the democratic success Afghanistan .
the Afghan independent electoral commission reported that 1.2 million women were registered with registered 3.6 million voters .

in the last few years , Mc@@ V@@ iko &apos;s owners , he said more than 5 million pounds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that staff and trade union representatives &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would experience &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the first thing if their activities would change . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the company &apos;s branch offices , G@@ MB &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Vit@@ ie &apos;s on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerns concerns that financing for moderni@@ zation of production lines will not be advanced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ MB @-@ Senior @-@ Organ@@ iser , Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that we can win no clarity about the needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross , aff@@ ecting our members . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; generations of families have worked here and the workers concentrate strongly on the local community and the major urban Glasgow , an important pillar for decent jobs in a field of high unemployment and social use . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wage and prosperity , and against the background of the Bre@@ xit , the increasing cost of life and chronic production process , the eastern end of Glasgow urgently need a th@@ ri@@ ving production presence at Mc@@ Vit@@ ie . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one spokes@@ woman in Pla@@ dis said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the branch offices at T@@ oll@@ cross has only yesterday received a letter of G@@ MB Scotland , and the company will respond directly to it as we estimate continuous commitment in employees and trade union representatives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two months ago , we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were discussed openly .
we discussed with the employees that we operate like all companies that are constantly competitive in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , and that applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years we invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross site , particularly in production lines and operative improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we recognize the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production site and at all . if our operations work at the location , staff and trade union representatives shall be the first to experience this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona been warned of Ne@@ ym@@ ar three years ago ?
the Side of La League lets her interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti .
Paris Saint @-@ Germain will not leave in her persecution by Ne@@ ym@@ ar after spending an offer of £ 189 million in order to trigger its free@@ wheel clau@@ se , but have warned Barcelona three years ago before the world record .
the sens@@ ational approach has heated the transit window in the summer , as the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record for more than double the previous brand , with Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United in the last season .
after completion , Ne@@ ym@@ ar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest @-@ paid professional sport@@ s@@ men in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of over 500,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way , as Ne@@ ym@@ ar forced his way to the outside , although a source in the proximity of the Catal@@ ans Council insist@@ ed that the club has always been his best to take care of him from Santos in 2013 .
but the soccer world was warned of this view three years ago from the PS@@ G President ?
as Manchester City 2014 expressed interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for every association who wanted to sign up one of PS@@ G &apos;s best players .
&quot; I &apos;m not worried , because they know that if they touch one of our players , we will contact them in opposition , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi .
&quot; we respect all the clubs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to sign one of our players on yourself , this will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona seems to have passed this line , whereby the Spanish Society expressed interest in the PS@@ G @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti early this summer .
PS@@ G made clear that it would not allow the International from Italy to leave under any circumstances , and Barcelona was able to feel the consequences of this interest by giving one of their price offers for Ne@@ ym@@ ar .

interview : &quot; Dom@@ en@@ ching Report on the Pope &apos;s brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Regen@@ s@@ burger cathedral @-@ report about the abuse of abuse on the Pope &apos;s brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this means author and historian Michael H@@ es@@ emann .
the final report for the mis@@ use sc@@ andal at the Rain@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ est@@ é continues to work on discussions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Christian Weis@@ sen@@ ator , spokes@@ man of the reform movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We are Church , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said after publication from the German press agency , he acquired by the former bishop Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of emer@@ itus Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , an excuse . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would serve very much for the pre@@ stige of the Catholic Church if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their profound regret on their under@@ p@@ ments or at the time the wrong assessment of processes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Vatican Council &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , critic@@ ised the coverage of violence with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two measures &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; regarding the attacks in Regensburg nobody doubt that it would pun@@ ish itself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sh@@ ame@@ ful and sh@@ ame@@ ful actions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the author of media manipulation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the national Italian bio@@ eth@@ ics committee . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hab@@ it that refers to the Catholic Church as a source of all evil , is already part of everyday experience and prepar@@ es public opinion that is for normal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also Für@@ st@@ in Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Taxis said in the interview with the Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you &apos;re looking forward to the church and that &apos;s a bound fres@@ co . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , she pointed out that in her youth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were a quite normal educational means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be done with dear children , as I was one to be ready . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they find it un@@ fair to use present standards for earlier decades , because the world has changed .
in connection with the reports about the abuse cases , pop@@ e @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also appeared .
&quot; &quot; &quot; totally wrong , author and historian Michael H@@ es@@ emann , who translated the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote in 12 languages . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I need to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger into protection , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says H@@ es@@ emann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he considers the results of the final report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report presented by the di@@ oc@@ ese of Regensburg with the En@@ lighten@@ ment At@@ tor@@ ney General Ulrich Weber ?
between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s , a total of 5@@ 47 Regen@@ s@@ burg cathedral spar@@ rows were ab@@ used with high pl@@ ums , &quot; victims of attacks , 67 dom@@ est@@ ry sexual abuse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the final report it says to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to sum up , that by Dom@@ en@@ master R. was applied in many cases of physical and mental violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even in high Emot@@ ional Loy@@ alty , the punishment for students could get fier@@ c@@ ely off .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , contrary to many other accus@@ ations , many victims are estim@@ ating the general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases even positive memories with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the interview , H@@ es@@ emann explains why the final report for the abuse sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger cathedral @-@ rows Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had reli@@ ed on his mind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. H@@ es@@ emann , the 440 pages report on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Incidents of Viol@@ ence to Viol@@ ence for Viol@@ ence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a contradic@@ tory picture of Dom@@ en@@ ster Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for one lift , many students emphas@@ ise his &quot; humanity . &quot;
secon@@ dly , it appears also known as cholesterol and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , who has been tangible for the Ö@@ f@@ teren , when a Dom@@ for@@ atz has played no top performance .
how do you compare this final report as its bi@@ ographer ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : if you &apos;re reading the effort and reading all the 440 pages long from the front to the back , you have to wonder why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger appears in it at all .
he has just been dedicated to eight pages and he is clearly acquitted of each suspicion of the medi@@ ator or complic@@ ity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
also the fo@@ rested processes at the pre@@ school happened outside of its sphere of sphere .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one can disc@@ ard him if they were too late or taken notice of getting serious enough seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Salv@@ ation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; Better World &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was written by practically all respon@@ dents , in which he worked as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Salv@@ ation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; better world &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so the vast majority of his student Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also describes a very excellent testimony , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; understand@@ able &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as extreme gut@@ we@@ ary teachers who were regularly conf@@ is@@ cated with cakes , cookies and cand@@ y and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; always &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of grapes of children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
merely a minority compl@@ ained about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and its high Emot@@ ional , which also led to W@@ ut@@ aus@@ arri@@ es .
that he did not only bring with his chairs and the key@@ chain to the ground , but also ear@@ marked with ear@@ nest and too nau@@ gh@@ ty boys on the hair and ears he had already regre@@ t@@ ted , deeply de@@ pl@@ eted and exc@@ used for them .
however , to its honor of honor , such education methods are in the fra@@ grant time , in the 1960s and 1970s , widespread in parents , as with teachers .
do you still know such breeding methods ?
of course , I think everyone of us was born before 1968 .
I also experienced this in a sec@@ ular school , a state school .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compared to what is actually happening in this report , namely the horri@@ ble sexual abuse and the poultry industry on the pre@@ school , they are certainly Bagh@@ dad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one wonders whether there is not to do with his fame and role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many media have just r@@ ushed out on him .
the Bavarian Pope work many , who never understood him , still e@@ ager .
but the truth is : the report dismissed Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every way !
in the media , in connection with the report , a lot about the subject of mis@@ use in the Rain@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ estic Lines has been reported .
will Georg R@@ atz@@ inger put on a burden or complic@@ ity in the final report with regard to sexual abuse ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : quite clearly no .
no one of the 67 victims of sexual ass@@ aults claimed to be entru@@ sted to the master &apos;s master .
not even the parents were consecr@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never dar@@ ed to talk with my father or my mother , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a covered representative for the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was all very embar@@ r@@ assed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real problem with the recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance of sexual abuse has been and is , however , that most victims are silent .
if they were not even parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , they certainly not have been a chor@@ us who would have been a colleague of the perpet@@ rators .
how do the dom@@ est@@ ing students gain R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in terms of abuse ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : a question@@ able student said it : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he would have had timely findings and would have been able to stop the respective perpet@@ rators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I consider it ... also for really absurd , accept@@ ing him ... Bu@@ ben in@@ tru@@ sive or more definite or rather re@@ opened , compared to their parents , inter@@ nat@@ s@@ ors , confi@@ denti@@ als , etc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that one speaks with him about sex ... - un@@ th@@ ink@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that in the ap@@ ron of affected pupils and / or their surroundings , he could not be confirmed in the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as for sexual abuse , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is therefore free of charge by everyone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so he cannot be accused of being prevented or brought it to the ad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , there is no reason to associate his good name with these contradic@@ ted crime , as unfortunately it happened in some cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the media , a lot of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ yer textiles &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had to read at the Rain@@ s@@ burger cathedral &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Weg@@ looking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will be thrown to the former Dom@@ en@@ master Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : that &apos;s the big problem that in the reporting everything was mixed and men@@ gt it became a huge mil@@ king of sexual abuse and off@@ wal@@ nuts and somewhere , in the middle of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but this is exactly a mis@@ use of the report .
it is also clean separately : between the pre@@ school and high school of the Dom@@ est@@ é , between sexual abuse and poultry textiles , we say once , other benefits .
furthermore , the report has been treated from the time since 1945 , thus also from four decades in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not choir director of the cathedral @-@ spar@@ rows .
all the aw@@ ful test education , the cases , in which the boys of sa@@ dist@@ ic teachers were sensiti@@ zed and exposed , then they were all at the pre@@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ hofen where there is really sk@@ in@@ ous states .
but with whom Dom@@ en@@ cap@@ master Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he got the boys only to face when they were already at the front desk of the cathedral .
that was , like most of the witnesses , the theme &quot; Pre@@ school &quot; tab@@ u .
it was only happy that you can escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; paradise &quot; states .
what else was different at the Dom@@ est@@ ial School ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : there was already discipline , but no sa@@ dist@@ al force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , when the report comes to the conclusion that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many victims the general humanity of R. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and therefore in numerous cases even positive memories with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so it remains at the most still the reproach .
however , despite all efforts the report could define only two periods in which it was reported from the conditions at the pre@@ school .
the first time 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish himself and from the operations at a school which he was not working and responsible ( as the witness ) did not want to hear anything , and then again at 1993 .
did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger dra@@ gged out the ears at the conditions ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ ot@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asium who even re@@ produced the report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in it he points to this point , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; That the school continues to practice test penalty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the danger of negative press costs , he recommended an urgent action .
this was of course at a time when legal clarity as inspec@@ tions were also banned in Bavaria .
before that , they occurred in a legal gray zone , just as everyone knows of us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was difficult to estimate for him , where the people might be ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated or dram@@ ati@@ zed and where really the permissible limit was exceeded . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one can &apos;t say , however , it was always looked .
that &apos;s just not right .
only in 1980 , the test penalty was officially abolished in schools in Bavaria .
Für@@ st@@ in Gl@@ oria from Th@@ urn und Taxis claimed it would be un@@ fair to use today &apos;s ped@@ agog@@ ical standards on that time .
how do you see it ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : we are talking about the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fall@@ a of An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; so the danger to assess the past to today &apos;s moral standards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the princess has quite right .
but of course , not for sexual abuse , who was ab@@ omin@@ able to all times , and also not for what was broken in the pre@@ school of resi@@ due and violence at innocent children &apos;s se@@ vers@@ aries , that goes far beyond that .
this is all quite dre@@ ad@@ ful and I &apos;m glad that it finally works .
but at the same time , I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection because all this had nothing to do with him .
his means for discipl@@ ines and punishment , so ear@@ nest and ears to move , were widespread in the 1970s .
as physical punishment it was forbidden , he also kept stri@@ cken in it .
what image of his rainy season has played Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the talks with you for the book &quot; My Brother of the Pope . &quot;
did the subject of Prü@@ gel@@ ding also occurred in the language ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , tells of his perspective , because the cathedral @-@ spar@@ rows played only a minor role .
nevertheless , I did not know that he led an aust@@ ere regim@@ ent there .
but even this has to be said : without these Perf@@ ect@@ ism , without this perfec@@ tion@@ alist discipline , it would probably hardly be possible to form a institution of World Heritage , true cultural ambassador in Europe and his musical tradition that went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with biscuits and cand@@ y alone , one makes no big singer and cand@@ y alone , at which field , always discipline , passion and self @-@ over@@ coming .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what kind of people did you experience Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the talks about their book ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : through the work on the book and beyond that I experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger especially well and again as wonderful , hum@@ orous , li@@ vel@@ ous , deeply believing and heart of good people , of which you could not imagine that he could only do a fly .
I get regular , like many former dom@@ est@@ ry still today , 23 years after his emer@@ al , regularly contact him to visit him - he is almost blind and he is almost blind and treated him as a member of her family .
those who don &apos;t forgive him until now , that he was once strictly speaking to them , are clearly in the minority .
most of them are grateful to him that he has enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music .
and that he always was a good , pat@@ ern@@ al teacher - a strict father , certainly that may be - but also a lovely respec@@ tful person , to which they still look up and honor them .
and please , even more clearly , all that one imag@@ ines him are educational methods that were at the time of the agenda .
we can be glad we have overcome this time long ago .
but it is highly un@@ just , a man , just because he is promin@@ ently and a more prominent brother has to make for the medi@@ al sin@@ ister .
there is the evil intention that stands behind , just too obvious .
for the report that has just been published , reli@@ eves Him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the level of places would have acquired a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who would have acquired great mer@@ its and without the outside of Bavaria and probably Germany would probably know the Regen@@ s@@ burger cathedral @-@ spar@@ rows at last . &quot; &quot; &quot;
