<seg id="3">A greeting card, where it is now dug for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small gardener affects the former reason of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official card of Munich supports exciting stories about days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It's annoying when maps are not current.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everyone knows who had to arrive at times, because the car-Navi was showing a green meadow instead of a bypass road.</seg>
<seg id="8">Historical maps of the digital Bavaria-Atlases, an offer of geoportals Bayern of the State Government, are anything but current - yet very illuminating.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially when you compare it to current online maps.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed in the spread-area of Munich's Merkur since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern-Atlas is a Flickenteppich, one of which is not the same as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the great coverage map, for cities and municipalities, more detailed maps were incorporated, called Urpositional petals.</seg>
<seg id="13">This created according to the Bayerischer Rundfunk's Walvis between 1810 and 1864 and jump to the first survey of Bayerns.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the spring of 1800 the French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wished for an overview of the occupied country, giving a topographic survey of Bavaria in order - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even though the French troops entered the peace of Lunéville from February 9, 1801 there were the neighbors who created the idea of a nationwide Bavaria-map.</seg>
<seg id="18">Kurfürst Max IV Joseph pushed forward the project, founded the "Topographical Bureau" - and thus the Bayerische Vermessaging Investigation.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Urpositional leaf for Munich comes from the year 1856 and is like all the others on the website of the Bavarian State Library.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison morning / Today is the most impressive example of its capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">One example is subsendling, which is still relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was born 21 years after the development of the map, so 1877, the Munich district of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today it lies in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses of submits will focus on today's Plinganserstraße which was named after George Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, leader of the Bavarian farmer's uprising against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where the Westpark is, you can see nothing but fields - at first glance: in writing a small-piece map with dozens of numbers and numbers: handwritten numbered pieces from the so-called "Urumption" which was derived from the basic tax.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "little parcels apply there today no more farmers - but the small gardener of the plant" "" "Land in Sun" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Theresienwiese, since 1810, was still a meadow, and no concrete desert in the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>

<seg id="33">There was 1858 / 59 built in the Munich district-Irrenanstalt "On the Auer Lünen."</seg>
<seg id="34">In 1872 Dr. Bernhard von Gudder conducted the institution - that psychiatrist who was brought to King Ludwig II's death in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>

<seg id="38">Eventually this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the circulatory plant in hair 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">Since 2006, the Isar-AMPER-Klinikum Munich-Ost is one of Germany's largest psychiatrists.</seg>
<seg id="40">In the area of former Auer Anstalt, young people in the Munich Salesianum are facing.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the 1920 building complex and walked in a youth hostel with training.</seg>

<seg id="45">The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The Allied bombings broke many holes in the city center in December 1944.</seg>
<seg id="47">One big stayed until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English Institute, small business houses and a tomb stone from the Middle Ages had been on the Marienhof, where these days were to work and on 5 April 2017 the groundbreaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn route.</seg>

<seg id="51">The National Association for the promotion of Farmers has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Missouri because of the discriminatory policy and the racist attacks of the state.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, which will come into force until 28 August 2017, urges afro-American travellers, visitors and Missourians, as a number of questionable, rassenbased occurrences will occur in the entire state and here," says it in the opinion of the group.</seg>
<seg id="53">A recent law of Missouri, which causes people to become a discrimination against discrimination, and the prosecutions of the state, which intensely aim undisproportionately to minorities, prompted the group to publish the travel warning, NAACP said.</seg>

<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that the organization issued for a state in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group cited incidents like racist violation of black students at the University of Missouri and death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died in unquestionable circumstances from the beginning of the year, after he had no more fuel while traveling through the state and was arrested by the police of Missouri in custody without a crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">"" "" "" "the Council also refers to a recent report by the Bureau of Missouri, in which black drivers in the state will be 75 percent more common than whites." ""</seg>

<seg id="64">"" "" "" "the travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law, which would make it harder to sue a company because of home or employment discrimination." ""</seg>

<seg id="67">Electric fence project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fischerbacher Weidezvaun project is a successful project and will continue next year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU members of the CDU and Kordula Kovac have provided a picture in front of the site.</seg>
<seg id="70">At the right of the family of Schwendemann, representatives of the farmers "CDU" together met with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann gave first insights into his farm in which he farms 55 hectares of meadows and 40 acres of forest, 40 dairy cows and as well as many kittens were supplied in five apartments.</seg>
<seg id="72">The "Schwarzwaldmilk" is for him the alternative market-market-market for milk of its cows, so Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="73">Only Regionals comes to the table of the holiday.</seg>
<seg id="74">Since he is also BLHV-Chairman of Fischerbach, he referred to the 'fence project as "elementary importance."</seg>

<seg id="79">"" "for mayor Thomas Schneider was clear:" "" "the commune recognized the importance of the electric fence and is pleased with the leader's promotion." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">At the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, farmers would have to support farmers.</seg>

<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the biggest treasure we have, are people who work in agriculture and make thoughts about how they continue their farm," "" "stressed the Mayor." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often in criticism for the promotion</seg>
<seg id="84">A total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in the year 2013.</seg>
<seg id="85">The annual conservation area is 40 hectares, which are not permitted until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">Half of the total cost of 71 500 euros was promoted by leader, a quarter contributed by the commune of Fischerbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Consequently, the farmers remained 12 million euros, which they had to invest in 16,2 kilometers of electric fence.</seg>
<seg id="88">"the big advantage is the longevity of the fences," explained Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "Kordula Kovac emphasized:" "" "you are doing a really good job, without farmers and women." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="97">Is nothing sacred?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump is taking up the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans love these as well as any other - therefore the carefully staged fall of Saddam Hussein on the Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump-regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a hitchoral dispute with Jim Acosta of CNN about the proposals of the President of the Republic of Liberty with the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To remain fair, Miller did not handle the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boatters and Liberty Imiters would have landed him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he took their importance, and in particular the importance that it was attributed to as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the Monument, added to its base.</seg>
<seg id="105">When Miller Acosta declared: "I don't want to go down to a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom, which enlightens the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem I refer to which was added later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is proper proper, but how he formulated it, isn't really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "it is about the contemptible words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state invites not only any old immigrants, but the trouble of the poor:" "" "your troubles, your poor, and your oppressed masses, who crave to breathe freely, the eleventh waste of your rich coasts." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="109">"" "there was never a time in which the" "" "elaping waste" "" "was better to see on our screens." ""</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller did not engage in literary critic - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural conflict: it is actually a conflict about the meaning of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words after their death on the basis - knew very well that they had completed a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show links between French and American republicanism by showing in an unused classical picture depiction of the female embodiment of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem, the female figure no more abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And there is a completely different name: mother of exilant.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup d and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just like Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, people wanted to change from right wing this long.</seg>
<seg id="118">The big scream Rush Limbaugh, a type of John the Baptist for coming back of trump, argued 2010 that the Statue of Liberty did not invite anyone, but rather an early neoccondoms, that bring the American flame to the replenished world: "Lady Liberty is going forward.</seg>
<seg id="119">It should bear the torch of freedom from the United States in the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch should not shine through the way into the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">Limbaugh is somewhat unusual here.</seg>
<seg id="122">The importance of the statue is quite and even a question of the point of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great fanciful act of Lazarus was to see them as they saw from the exhaustive, but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys to the deck of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is in the truest sense to see the world from a perspective of people who seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue spoke to them the words of hope and the welcome which they must hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And of course, this is not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever wish to recognise.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch should not shine through the way, but hatred, who is the only source of power to inflame.</seg>

<seg id="466">750 years of St. Hilarius Church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the Bergkirche the old cemetery-area in Tummy will be invited to a Serenade on Sunday, 16th July at 16.30.</seg>

<seg id="472">According to the document, according to the Urlinger mountain apart from the former parish church also a beautiful farm, which belonged to the church or patron saint, and not vice versa.</seg>

<seg id="485">They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">The remains of the church threatened to fall in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869 the Tumlinger Hilarius cemetery also served as the last resting place for the dead.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was extended and the assistance of the Hilariuskirche was canceled.</seg>

<seg id="1123">Any consequences will be coming to Paris Saint-Germain by the UEFA still, as the leading organization that monitors the European game has the power to offer teams of access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Financial Fair-Play-rules, which were summoned by UEFA Europa, mean that PSG has to point out sometime, that the transfer of Neymar was financed without great losses.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million $) to buy the Brazilian from his contract, and Neymar will receive a salary, which will amount to several ten million dollars a year.</seg>

<seg id="1128">Clubs may apply a lot of money for the purchase of players, but with legitimate sole sources, which enable them to break the break-even point in their business on the football-related business.</seg>
<seg id="1129">The FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election to the UEFA President in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">The former French player believed that clubs in their pursuit had enormous debts to themselves, effectively fraudulent and risked to ruin, when banks or owners have returned their support.</seg>
<seg id="1131">In 2011, FFP shifted from concentration to the debts of the clubs on the surveillance of their losses.</seg>

<seg id="1327">That was my request, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1328">For this purpose she commissioned the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to make 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home, which was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms, so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which you could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to be creative in order to redeem the awarding.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel work is quite complicated," he explains.</seg>
<seg id="1332">"we had to arrange the rooms so that they were overstacked, without having to gaps ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="1333">"" "it wasn't just about building a single platform, but to make the steel that it had the right height for the position above or below." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms in full height - with lots of additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine there is a classic copper light window by Retrouvius down the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille Lighting set the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">On both ends a short corridor is mirrored to leave him for longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen the mirror feels like a window in another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all seating and glasses of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">Through the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can lock the kitchen if it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of engineering went in," explains Erfan of steel reinforced, veneered MDF-door.</seg>
<seg id="1345">"it is mutual, so it is when you push the door, very easily glides."</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to the clever use of space and storage, Joanne was able to win extra 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day, you will sell the land area - or how your property is estimated," says Erfan.</seg>
<seg id="1348">"" "" "" "in a rudimentary form a real estate agent will occur and make a calculation based on ground size." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here, they have managed to enlarge the floor space, and at the same time use high-quality materials that provide space to the luxurious benefits.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"the materials are things you touch, and therefore help to create an emotional connection in a home," says Erfan.</seg>
<seg id="1351">"you don't forget to the electrical outlets in the walls.</seg>
<seg id="1352">These are important, but they do not play with your heart. "</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square meter of somewhat standard into something quite amazing.</seg>

<seg id="1777">Mordillo was a time of the most published cartoons, the bolles of his figures are his trademark.</seg>
<seg id="1778">Also with 85 the Argentinier is still working and working on a film.</seg>
<seg id="1779">His message: laughter, "because there is too much sorrow in the world."</seg>
<seg id="1780">Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.</seg>
<seg id="1781">In the first years as an artist he stroke himself among other things as a draughtsman for congratulation - what frustrated him.</seg>
<seg id="1782">"the happiest day in my professional life was the day when lost in my job," he once said.</seg>
<seg id="1783">After charging stations in Lima, New York and Paris at the end of the 60s the breakthrough came: with the release of its cartoons in Paris Match "and then also in the" Star "and other leading magazines around the world.</seg>
<seg id="1784">Even in China Mordillo took many fans.</seg>
<seg id="1785">Again, the artists were inspired by towns.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Large, roundish mordillo figures frowns in drawings with the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1787">In the early morning, he still sits at the animation today, working almost ten hours every day.</seg>
<seg id="1788">About calendars, puzzles, books for Gross and Small, T-Shirts, Plush Animals and watches do not find much dissemination worldwide.</seg>

<seg id="1797">The lavender is relayed in terms of drought reflecting conditions and because of the illnesses of severe insects, which scientists and farmers, who try to find solutions, headaches great headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, expert of the agricultural research institution CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "the Lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to climate change during the past years, much less rain in spring and much more in autumn.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has effects on the lifespan of lavender.</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The weekly paper Riodoce usually meet Wednesdays to check their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state Sinaloa, which organised crime, corrupt civil servants and incontinual drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">It was told them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-level journalists will discuss what feels more secure: they are supposed to take their children with grenades, which were the aim of an attack with grenades, or at home in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have three words on one board at the front of the room: opponent, neutral, allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">You ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary, perceptions and abdominal muscles.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug smuggling, politicians, business people, journalists who are suspected of standing on the auditory list of government or cartels, a catalogue of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There are no rest of violence, and while throughout the country the corpses are increasingly frequent: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012. 589, according to attacks and threats, there were at least seven deaths in seven countries this year.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter you are editor and her inspirator of Riodoce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "the biggest mistake is to be living in Mexico and journalist," "" "said Valdez, in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">His stealing is deeply experienced when his presence is present - a large photo by Valdez, which shows his middle finger with the word "Justice". two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, carry t-shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and reporters discuss their shared topics, the trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Even though 2010, a probing Office has been erected to process the cases of journalists, it has led only two criminal proceedings according to the committee to protect journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As for most thousands of Morden, who are related to drug trafficking and organized crime every year, the murderers of journalists are only rarely asked in court.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Riodoce they are still insisting to treat the violence of Sinaloa, although they are inconsoling and although the terrain is still obituent.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information about the killer, without justice, the meeting for discussion of safety has little use, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"" "" "" "it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we don't know why, we don't mislet everyone."</seg>
<seg id="1828">In the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of Riodoce in the capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He only managed to drive a few blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was forced by two men. he was shot from his car and 12 times was shot on him, presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with "forced river."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The cap drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to wandering in Culiacan freely around.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But there is nothing but silence on the subject of Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzmans was arrested in the past year and the extradition to the United States in January was Sinaloa, one of the most bloodiest battlefields of the country, because rival factions were struggling here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa, anyone or more people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of enchanted, two-story Mausoleen for drug addicts, which are larger than many homes for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">"" "forget about a minute that there is a state of" "" "calm" "" "if only one cartel control over the coast with its valuable ports and drugs trade routes in the United States." ""</seg>
<seg id="1838">Nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, was broken with the guilt that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misconceptions have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">First of all, there was the publication of a interview with Damo Lopez, a leader of the rival cartel fractions in war with Guzmans-sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication may have been annoyed by the sons, whom members bought up every copy of the edition, once they have been extradited to newspaper kiosks.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second fault was not to force Valdez, after the seizure of a different newspaper, which had published the same story to leave the country on its own safety.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues imitate that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He was an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined forces with five colleagues to the foundation of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"" "in Sinaloa," "" "it was impossible to run journalism without the problem of the crab problem," "" "said Bojorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1847">With time, the paper has earned a reputation for the brave and honest coverage, and the turnover and advertising took over.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters loved it, hard-resolved investigations without fear of censorship, and the reader was fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody had to handle.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the creation of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors Cabot Prize" for its coverage in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee to Protect Journalists for his courage in pursuing the Mexican drug history, wherever it led.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He volunteered to be afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"" "" "" "I want to continue to live," "" "he said at the time of the CPJ award." ""</seg>
<seg id="1853">"" "drug trafficking in Sinaloa," "" "is a way of life," "" "he said in October last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV." ""</seg>

<seg id="1855">"" "I don't want to be asked:" "" "what did you do in the face of so many moments... why did you not say what was going on?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1856">The Rioce team mires Valdez, the fun bird that was like a dockworker, who was a friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">You trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always carry his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and there is always sitting at the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now ask them: was his love for routine his calamity?</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death also forced them to ask their own assumptions about how they can do their work on the best and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"" "" "" "they don't like it if you deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their home starting and runways," "" "to move drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-molding and self-maintenance.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it smells bad, stay away from it.</seg>
<seg id="1867">"" "the trouble is, the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that" "" "smell a sense that can be fooled... and then the thing happened with Javier." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, how he and others say, apply in Sinaloa, not just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states in which a toxic mixture of lucrative smugglances, weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is changing constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the room where the staff of Riodoce met for security training, there were suddenly no mobile phones allowed. days before, Spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside, two police officers sought shelter from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building from Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half of the jest, some of the reporters questioned whether these officers were among the 50 percent of the policemen, which the governor himself said as not trustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It is months ago, since the reporter had gone into the mountain landscape, where the drug gangs de facto are under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the edition of this week, Riodoce has blocked three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the murder of the brother of the former famous Boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an Exposé to state expenditures, focusing on the home town of the Governor.</seg>
<seg id="1878">There was a group found in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the Office of the Office of the Office.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was advisable when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows that restaurant is a favourite locally by drug traffickers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter knew from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician, who ruled the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (pri) that ruled nearly all the century all political planes.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Several pri governors were accused of corruption because of high-term corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">"" "Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant, including one in which a son of" "" "El Chapo" "" "Guzman went into a military attack." ""</seg>
<seg id="1883">Only a few months earlier, readers of Valdez have been considered the best informed source of abduction.</seg>
<seg id="1884">"in the past we had known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El FLACO" because of its slender body stature.</seg>
<seg id="1885">"all channels of communication with our sources are broken."</seg>
<seg id="1886">The office of Valdez was dedicated to the storage room for signs and stickers that are dedicated to the Morde of journalists dedicated to something they would never expect: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez graven a few signs and went next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist for the office of the Prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed, in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>

<seg id="1891">On this day, the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and tries to gather international support for the justice in the case Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1892">At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities to provoke journalists, because they have told the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">She has asked that she was regrouped by the government because she is worried that her anger has injured their objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="1894">"" "Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico by organised crime committed by the government officials and a similar society." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1897">"you die in Mexico because they want you to hold the mouth," said Ramirez.</seg>
<seg id="1898">Obviously the murderers have a deterrent effect.</seg>
<seg id="1899">No one forget the death of the Blogist Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern boundary of Tamaulipas six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1900">Her body was found together with a note that was signed by the Zetas cartel: "here I am because of my reports."</seg>
<seg id="1901">A computer keyboard and earphones lay apart from its separate head.</seg>

<seg id="1904">In 2010 the Diario de Ciudad Juarez became public in the drug area with an editorial on the frontpage with the heading "What do you want from us?"</seg>
<seg id="1905">Some journalists are fled from their home states or even from the country.</seg>

<seg id="2089">The bit gallery moves people, although they haven't been built for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian zone is outdated since the first presentation of 2009 the population in advocates and opponents.</seg>
<seg id="2091">Cold leaves the subject hardly any cold.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The topic "Volksfreund Bitburg" is also discussed on our Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="2093">While the one to a bit gallery say: "that would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be real great" (Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side: "no man" (Siggi Nowy) or quite simply: "magnitude" (Lars Scholz).</seg>
<seg id="2094">While the advocates are building that there will be a gallery of more clients in the city, while others also benefit from other business, fear that the pedestrian zone are bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Furthermore, the gallery will be planned on the grounds, on which the farmers market stands will offer their products in the 13 direct market.</seg>
<seg id="2096">The construction work will conclude with the start of construction.</seg>
<seg id="2097">The gallery Macher want to integrate a market hall in the new building - and for Beda place with possibility to sit outside.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Room: "we have been selling almost weekly in the peasant market for many years.</seg>

<seg id="2101">We would wish that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery, there is a chance to maintain this offer.</seg>

<seg id="2108">There are plenty of them in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">You see how many shopkeepers standing empty here - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">However, since there is not even a regular weekly market, it is all the more important to us at least the market hall remains.</seg>
<seg id="2111">After all, the product offered is fresh, mostly offered directly from producer and is inexpensive.</seg>
<seg id="2112">As you can see, shop operations are rented in a shopping mall only by major companies, because the local hunters are often not portable for a retailer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Too bad, special stores there is almost no more and what is left of it, will probably disappear. "</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping center with a market hall doesn't fit for me.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit into Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Above all: where should the farmers market hall pass during the building time?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old EDEKA would be the solution - even on the duration, if the bit gallery is actually coming.</seg>

<seg id="2125">In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces are visible - white, black and brown, which are almost invisibly the same - hanging on cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from cheeks and hair cut, which were sent to by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent out the excerpts from the prison Fort Leavenworth where the former intelligence analyzer had served a 35-year-old prison sentence, after which she publicly depressed diplomatic messages to the WikiLeaks website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition opened on August 2, is called "Becoming Resemblance (An appropriate resemblance).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years correspondent between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline was united in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a Transwoman and a white dissident, when he was only three days in his office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg has been created by the algorithmic analysis of DNA, which could look up from Manning, a sharp comment not only to the formulability of DNA data - the many ways you can interprets and the inherent determining of these interpretations - but also for identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, has already been convicted of the identification as a woman since their puberty, was convicted of 20 charges, including six violations of the spying law, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Through the prison, her image was suppressed, so much that it only gave a single photo - a grained, black-white Selfie, in which Manning is visibly sitting on a driver's seat and a platted blonde wishing is associated with which it was associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg came straight from the great success of their 2012-project "Stranger Visions".</seg>
<seg id="2134">In it the artist produced portraits of foreigners from forensic artifacts like cigarette stains and chewing gum, by removing the DNA from the trash to make a picture of it, like those people might look.</seg>
<seg id="2135">This was the time they received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>

<seg id="2137">And she could not visit at that time and could not be photographed, so you took contact with Chelsea and asked if they wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her incarcerated muse became an unequal letter that followed several letters in the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even created a comic of Shoili canyo illustrated Comic "Supple Images," who would like to convert a future to see the president Chelyss Judgment, and it would be able to see the exhibition personally.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama actually was just a few days after the book was published, Mannings would demand for seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome kind of lucky meeting.</seg>

<seg id="2143">"" "in one on the wall of the gallery" "" "Manning with its oversized signature" "" "(the" "" "in her family name" "" ") is an end to the" "" "automatic shattering, whose foundation gender, race, sexuality and culture." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall is its mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandth of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show through the inclusion of 200 letters (or nucleotide after the highly developed scientific Dictionary of the artist), as surprisingly similar, at least in biological ways we are all.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully take away, is that our genome doesn't care about who we are and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work is to be seen from 2007, Spurious Memories.</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell as many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are."</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in its own room, is one side of the Comic-Novelle mentioned above.</seg>
<seg id="2149">It shows Manning as they appear with a free-free trade in the hand of the United States like King Kong.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"if they chill out your speech, they have won," says it.</seg>

<seg id="2292">But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from its cozy seat at the irl River valley in Kent and is now for inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a moplarious Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents.</seg>

<seg id="2296">It is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive: he wrote in 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he was unexpectedly emotionally.</seg>
<seg id="2297">"I only reacted on the thumbprint on the side of a letter, who was written by a double player in the 1700's, who worked for the Jacobins," he says.</seg>

<seg id="2306">The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown since the National Trust received full access in 2006, when the last Erbin Elizabeth Hussey died.</seg>

<seg id="2401">And then there's the Roxxxy Gold sex robot developed by True Companion with preprogrammed personalities such as "Frigid Farrah," which transcribed the impression of zapping and "Wild Wendy" with a "adventurous person."</seg>
<seg id="2402">"" "" "" "Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as good as possible" "", "the website of True Companion." ""</seg>

<seg id="2404">During the day, she also has its moods - just like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">It may be tired, be fixed to conversation, or it can be "in the mood!"</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many worrying aspects of this rise of sex robbers - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive traits of rape, if one step towards Frigid (means here: reluctant) Farrah is going on, troubled one of the most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his site True Companion Roxxxy with a vibrator, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men then have no Roxxxy?" it's called on the website.</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these Sex Robot are not only a fetish or just another sex toy.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their emergence and their increasing refinement indicate a slightly darker and deep in our culture, to retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards sex with submission to sex with submission as optional encore.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men will of course do not keep sex robots, and while the FRR noted its rising popularity, they remain provisional in the edge of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what transeeth from the marginal zones can be in relation to the spirit of time in which we live, very instructive.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or insulting until it gives them permission to them.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is a certain overlapping that this highly developed sex robot in a time emerge, in which the rights of women worldwide are threatened, in which there is a president in the White House who has beaming women sexually attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most awesome aspect of the TV series' The Hand maid's Tale '(' The Report of the handmaid ') are not the graphic images, the indolated body and the eochens eyes, but how realistic this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">Gilead is a jump, but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to produce a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (though with porpoar proportions).</seg>

<seg id="2424">Trumps great performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney a epitome of healthy human mind</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a Binsensibility of the Trump era, that the political splits, which have polarized US voters, also split families in small format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Ernest dankfest there were newspapers in the USA newspapers with suggestions about how to deal with the horror of dreadful relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We are all committed to letting us put our filter bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less notices has been summed up the power of trumps, families.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I mention this because my cousin, a left-directed poet, who lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the republicans in our family who visited New York this week.</seg>
<seg id="2431">She reminded me that the unit may have a powerful effect against a common enemy.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With trump in the White House each one knows them, including the republican relationship, with which she had fought for decades because of politics, suddenly and quite strange at the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">To the dining table, this is certainly a good thing, but it falls to me in another context that this also brings significant risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left was strengthened by trump, but the entailing effect of his presidency has the power to push us all right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">"" "when we speak of" "" "normalization" "" "and trump, we refer to the creepy possibility that us no longer get rid of his Mittens of one day." ""</seg>
<seg id="2436">However, there is another long-term scenario, in which trump republicans of the right wing, normalizes, "suddenly appear in comparison with his standards as the epitome of merits.</seg>
<seg id="2437">I find myself from an active nostalgic version of Mitt Romney, who fell 14% of income tax (but at least we knew how his tax returns) - both in comparison to trump in fact occur as a very mild crime.</seg>
<seg id="2438">If Trump is going, the next candidate of Republicans must be only mentally healthy in order to qualify as unmeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin was in the city, we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the carousel of the New York Parkdepartment, and the best three dollars you can spend in town if you don't need any caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are huge, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all Clowns are buggy and the animals are turning to look full of fear through their own shoulders - extremly dark and the climatic music gives this in strange ways.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of high buildings will be old, the Skylines become familiar to provide much excitement, and the reality of the city is not just a dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Five-five years later, and I'm still not over the day, when I found that Swiss Cottage is no Swiss cottage in fact - the topic Pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not one of the big roundabout in the north of London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">The Central Park-Karussell is still a strange magical experience, as here two years old, a 11-year old and two women in the 40-s can go on it and all have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could rate this carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately no one has asked about it.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, I was forced to rate my "experience" with transactions on a scale from one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the coffee house on the corner of my street it is the same, plus the option to get the evaluation with a 15% tip - this to buy something about the shopper.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This does not only lead to a slowdown of what is supposed to be a neutral exchange but also practices pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation in which no need is required.</seg>

<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable condition that affects approximately 1.3 million in the US and in Great Britain, causing magnets, recurring or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While those affected are usually advised to alleviate meat and dairy products in order to alleviate their symptoms, researchers found the amino acid tryptophan of proteins to develop immune cells which promote a tolerant intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells in the gut are patrolling to ensure that damaging microbes that hide in the body, do not penetrate into the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are capable of dissolving inflammation, are offset by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the balance is too far towards inflammation, it can result in an anti-inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">"" "" "" "in experiments I found that a kind of tolerance subsidy immune cell is present in mice that bear a certain bacterium in their inwards." ""</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium uses tryptophan - one of the blocks of proteins - to trigger the image of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus Cruteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiosis, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had from these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and one to tryptophan rich diet are tolerant, less anti-inflammatory bowel miths, if the same system also work for people.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The Postdoctoral candidate Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan has sought out a kind of immuncell that she found out that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe that was not accommodated separately.</seg>
<seg id="2593">It assumed that the difference with the intestinal microbiomes of mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The mice of mice were sequenced DNA-sequenced and six bacterial species were found in mice with immune cells, but without them missing in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice had grown up in a sterile environment so that they lacked an intestinal microbiom and they did not have developed this type of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">In order to understand how the bacteria increased to the immune system, the researchers accepted L. Cruteri in a liquid and then overled small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells, which were insulated by mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed to tolerable cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component was cleaned from the liquid, it turned out to be a byproduct of tryptophan metabolic, which is known as Indol-3-lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">If the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the diet of mice, the number of these cells grew by around 50 percent, but if the tryptophances were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan declared that people have the same tolerant-promoting cells like mice, and that most of us may protect L. Cruteri in our gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether Tryptophan-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as with mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in people with anti-inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">"" "she said:" "" "the development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote, as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine." ""</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially can lead high tryptophances in the presence of L. reuteri to an extension of this population. "</seg>

<seg id="2639">It is the preliminary highlight of a series of large and small crises in SPD country associations.</seg>
<seg id="2640">And nobody knows what comes next.</seg>

<seg id="2644">That was then even worse - and everything was much worse.</seg>
<seg id="2645">The SPD's defeat in Kiel brought the SPD to the diving, the Düsseldorf-Plekite brought the party smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="2646">The comrades caught up again in the weeks thereafter.</seg>
<seg id="2647">Then, when they had just had new courage, the G-20 came from Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="2648">And the next lowcase came with him.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD country, lost his Nimbus on that weekend, because he was sitting in the Elbphilharmonie while his city burned.</seg>
<seg id="2650">And because in the crisis communications he made pretty much wrong to do what you can do wrong.</seg>

<seg id="2664">Mrs. Tvests is not elected as direct candidatin, but on the country list of the Saxon Green parliament, the lower Saxon deputies.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The logical consequence would be that it returns its mandate.</seg>

<seg id="2716">The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was the core of the event on July 17th at the White House with American construction programs.</seg>

<seg id="2718">Built in Connecticut, a helicopter from Maine, a fireman from Wisconsin and a forklift truck was exhibited in Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="2719">The Military Office of the White House asked the presence of helicopters in a fragmentary order or Frago, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, after the recordings of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMx-1), the unit responsible for operation of the helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2722">Note that, if the flight departing from the White House, the note should be delayed, due to the limitation of service hours a second crew would be needed.</seg>

<seg id="2730">But official events have political overtones.</seg>
<seg id="2731">At the event, the President gave a breach for the reform of the health reform that was underway in the Senate, and he propagated efforts to preserve the government regulations.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The use of aircraft that is known as Marine One or Air Force One, from politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.</seg>

<seg id="2743">HMx-1 does not maintain budgetary drawings for the presidential journey, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.</seg>

<seg id="2889">The Regensburger cathedral-report about the abuse of abuse on the Pope's brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This means author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report for the misuse scandal at the Rainsburger Domesté continues to work on discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">"" "Christian Weissenator, spokesman of the reform movement" "" "We are Church," "" "said after publication from the German press agency, he acquired by the former bishop Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of emeritus Pope Benedict XVI, an excuse." ""</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would serve very much for the prestige of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger would express their profound regret on their underpments or at the time the wrong assessment of processes.</seg>
<seg id="2894">"" "the Vatican Council" "" "Osservatore Romano" "" "said," "" "on the other hand, criticised the coverage of violence with the" "" "two measures" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">"" "regarding the attacks in Regensburg nobody doubt that it would punish itself" "" "shameful and shameful actions," "" "the author of media manipulation," "" "says the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the national Italian bioethics committee." ""</seg>
<seg id="2896">"" "" "" "the habit that refers to the Catholic Church as a source of all evil, is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion that is for normal" "" "writes Scaraffia." ""</seg>
<seg id="2897">"" "also Fürstin Gloria of Thurn und Taxis said in the interview with the Bayerischer Rundfunk:" "" "you're looking forward to the church and that's a bound fresco." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2899">They find it unfair to use present standards for earlier decades, because the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports about the abuse cases, pope-brother Georg Ratzinger also appeared.</seg>
<seg id="2901">"" "totally wrong, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who translated the" "" "My brother of the Pope" "" "wrote in 12 languages." ""</seg>
<seg id="2902">"" "" "" "I need to take Georg Ratzinger into protection," "" "says Hesemann," "" "for all this had nothing to do with him," "" "he considers the results of the final report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is in the 440-page report presented by the diocese of Regensburg with the Enlightenment Attorney General Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">Between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s, a total of 547 Regensburg cathedral sparrows were abused with high plums, "victims of attacks, 67 domestry sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2905">"" "in the final report it says to Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994," "" "to sum up, that by Domenmaster R. was applied in many cases of physical and mental violence." ""</seg>
<seg id="2906">Even in high Emotional Loyalty, the punishment for students could get fiercely off.</seg>
<seg id="2907">"" "" "" "however, contrary to many other accusations, many victims are estimating the general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases even positive memories with him." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report for the abuse scandal at the Regensburger cathedral-rows Georg Ratzinger had relied on his mind.</seg>
<seg id="2909">"" "Mr. Hesemann, the 440 pages report on the" "" "Incidents of Violence to Violence for Violence" "" "is a contradictory picture of Domenster Georg Ratzinger." ""</seg>
<seg id="2910">For one lift, many students emphasise his "humanity."</seg>
<seg id="2911">Secondly, it appears also known as cholesterol and perfectionist, who has been tangible for the Öfteren, when a Domforatz has played no top performance.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you compare this final report as its biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if you're reading the effort and reading all the 440 pages long from the front to the back, you have to wonder why the name Georg Ratzinger appears in it at all.</seg>
<seg id="2914">He has just been dedicated to eight pages and he is clearly acquitted of each suspicion of the mediator or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Also the forested processes at the preschool happened outside of its sphere of sphere.</seg>
<seg id="2916">"" "" "" "one can discard him if they were too late or taken notice of getting serious enough seriously." ""</seg>
<seg id="2917">"" "the" "" "Salvation," "" "and" Better World "" "" was written by practically all respondents, in which he worked as "" "" Salvation, "" "" and "" "" better world "" "." "" "</seg>
<seg id="2918">"" "so the vast majority of his student Georg Ratzinger also describes a very excellent testimony," "" "sincere," "", "" "" "competent," "" "and" understandable "" "," as extreme gutweary teachers who were regularly confiscated with cakes, cookies and candy and "" "" always "" "" of grapes of children. "" "</seg>
<seg id="2919">Merely a minority complained about his perfectionism and its high Emotional, which also led to Wutausarries.</seg>
<seg id="2920">That he did not only bring with his chairs and the keychain to the ground, but also earmarked with earnest and too naughty boys on the hair and ears he had already regretted, deeply depleted and excused for them.</seg>
<seg id="2921">However, to its honor of honor, such education methods are in the fragrant time, in the 1960s and 1970s, widespread in parents, as with teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you still know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think everyone of us was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also experienced this in a secular school, a state school.</seg>
<seg id="2925">"" "" "" "compared to what is actually happening in this report, namely the horrible sexual abuse and the poultry industry on the preschool, they are certainly Baghdad." ""</seg>
<seg id="2926">One wonders whether there is not to do with his fame and role as a brother of Benedict XVI, that many media have just rushed out on him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">The Bavarian Pope work many, who never understood him, still eager.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report dismissed Georg Ratzinger in every way!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In the media, in connection with the report, a lot about the subject of misuse in the Rainsburger Domestic Lines has been reported.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Will Georg Ratzinger put on a burden or complicity in the final report with regard to sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: quite clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No one of the 67 victims of sexual assaults claimed to be entrusted to the master's master.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were consecrated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I never dared to talk with my father or my mother," "" "said a covered representative for the others," "" "It was all very embarrassed." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem with the reconnaissance of sexual abuse has been and is, however, that most victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they were not even parents and siblings, they certainly not have been a chorus who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the domesting students gain Ratzinger's role in terms of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questionable student said it: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he would have had timely findings and would have been able to stop the respective perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"" "" "" "I consider it... also for really absurd, accepting him... Buben intrusive or more definite or rather reopened, compared to their parents, internatsors, confidentials, etc." ""</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks with him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "thus, the report comes to the very clear result:" "" "that in the apron of affected pupils and / or their surroundings, he could not be confirmed in the investigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">As for sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is therefore free of charge by everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2943">"" "" "" "so he cannot be accused of being prevented or brought it to the ad." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore, there is no reason to associate his good name with these contradicted crime, as unfortunately it happened in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">"" "in the media, a lot of" "" "" "" "Geyer textiles" "" "had to read at the Rainsburger cathedral" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2946">"" "in the report" "" "Weglooking" "" "will be thrown to the former Domenmaster Georg Ratzinger." ""</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: that's the big problem that in the reporting everything was mixed and mengt it became a huge milking of sexual abuse and offwalnuts and somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But this is exactly a misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">It is also clean separately: between the preschool and high school of the Domesté, between sexual abuse and poultry textiles, we say once, other benefits.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Furthermore, the report has been treated from the time since 1945, thus also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not choir director of the cathedral-sparrows.</seg>
<seg id="2952">All the awful test education, the cases, in which the boys of sadistic teachers were sensitized and exposed, then they were all at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen where there is really skinous states.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with whom Domencapmaster Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he got the boys only to face when they were already at the front desk of the cathedral.</seg>
<seg id="2954">That was, like most of the witnesses, the theme "Preschool" tabu.</seg>
<seg id="2955">It was only happy that you can escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradise" states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What else was different at the Domestial School?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there was already discipline, but no sadistal force.</seg>
<seg id="2958">"" "and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, when the report comes to the conclusion that" "" "many victims the general humanity of R." "" "and therefore in numerous cases even positive memories with him." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2959">So it remains at the most still the reproach.</seg>
<seg id="2960">However, despite all efforts the report could define only two periods in which it was reported from the conditions at the preschool.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time 1970 / 71, when he began to establish himself and from the operations at a school which he was not working and responsible (as the witness) did not want to hear anything, and then again at 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Did Georg Ratzinger dragged out the ears at the conditions?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domotatzengymnasium who even reproduced the report.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "in it he points to this point," "" "That the school continues to practice test penalty." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">In view of the danger of negative press costs, he recommended an urgent action.</seg>
<seg id="2966">This was of course at a time when legal clarity as inspections were also banned in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that, they occurred in a legal gray zone, just as everyone knows of us.</seg>
<seg id="2968">"" "" "" "there was difficult to estimate for him, where the people might be exaggerated or dramatized and where really the permissible limit was exceeded." ""</seg>
<seg id="2969">One can't say, however, it was always looked.</seg>
<seg id="2970">That's just not right.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980, the test penalty was officially abolished in schools in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Fürstin Gloria from Thurn und Taxis claimed it would be unfair to use today's pedagogical standards on that time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see it?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"" "Michael Hesemann: we are talking about the" "" "Falla of Anachronism" "", "so the danger to assess the past to today's moral standards." ""</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess has quite right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But of course, not for sexual abuse, who was abominable to all times, and also not for what was broken in the preschool of residue and violence at innocent children's seversaries, that goes far beyond that.</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all quite dreadful and I'm glad that it finally works.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time, I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His means for disciplines and punishment, so earnest and ears to move, were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">As physical punishment it was forbidden, he also kept stricken in it.</seg>
<seg id="2981">What image of his rainy season has played Georg Ratzinger in the talks with you for the book "My Brother of the Pope."</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the subject of Prügelding also occurred in the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI, tells of his perspective, because the cathedral-sparrows played only a minor role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I did not know that he led an austere regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But even this has to be said: without these Perfectism, without this perfectionalist discipline, it would probably hardly be possible to form a institution of World Heritage, true cultural ambassador in Europe and his musical tradition that went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With biscuits and candy alone, one makes no big singer and candy alone, at which field, always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2987">"" "" "" "what kind of people did you experience Georg Ratzinger in the talks about their book?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and beyond that I experienced Georg Ratzinger especially well and again as wonderful, humorous, livelous, deeply believing and heart of good people, of which you could not imagine that he could only do a fly.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I get regular, like many former domestry still today, 23 years after his emeral, regularly contact him to visit him - he is almost blind and he is almost blind and treated him as a member of her family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who don't forgive him until now, that he was once strictly speaking to them, are clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most of them are grateful to him that he has enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he always was a good, paternal teacher - a strict father, certainly that may be - but also a lovely respectful person, to which they still look up and honor them.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, even more clearly, all that one imagines him are educational methods that were at the time of the agenda.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad we have overcome this time long ago.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is highly unjust, a man, just because he is prominently and a more prominent brother has to make for the medial sinister.</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is the evil intention that stands behind, just too obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">For the report that has just been published, relieves Him.</seg>
<seg id="2998">"" "" "" "now the level of places would have acquired a 93-year-old man who would have acquired great merits and without the outside of Bavaria and probably Germany would probably know the Regensburger cathedral-sparrows at last." ""</seg>
