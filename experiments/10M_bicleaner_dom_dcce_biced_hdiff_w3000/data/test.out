Jennifer A@@ ni@@ ston : I &apos;m getting stuck in drawers .
Jennifer A@@ ni@@ ston should not always be perfect or successful .
this is clearly clear to the Hollywood star in an interview .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m getting stuck in drawers , or getting worn by the outside label that usually have little to do with me and reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t have the desire to always be perfect and successful . &quot;
to be honest , these things are rather u@@ pp@@ u@@ red to me . &quot;
Jennifer A@@ ni@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh about it as &quot; Miss Perfect , &quot; as described in the current &quot; Cos@@ mop@@ olitan . &quot;
most of the actress spend their time at home , pre @-@ tv television with sparkling D@@ utt and mexican food , it &apos;s called in the magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to white , she will bring the question of the child &apos;s desire , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We must not be married or children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Hollywood star . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the film runs on the 25th of August .
Gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the sports pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
at the end of a golf course in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger was looking for a little variety with a ride on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden sports pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a couple of minutes the horses remember their holiday , they pursued after his spe@@ e@@ ches in the quick gal@@ lop .
one kilometer at this pace , I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; Lan@@ ger says .
and thus the e@@ quest@@ rian arri@@ es ended again .
on Saturday the best gol@@ fer in all times - 101 tournament victories - was again close to horses .
he left his family over the plant of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he did not go for photo purposes .
it was the first time in Aachen and thus also at CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sports aid was handed over to the man from An@@ hausen in a small gala to the Golden Sports pyramid .
in awards , the symp@@ a@@ thetic athl@@ ete is not lacking .
Bundes@@ accur@@ sed Cross , Silver Lor@@ be@@ er@@ blatt , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the year ...
even the British Queen has already s@@ acked him .
long is the 18th prize winners of the sports pyramid .
in Aachen he met the first winner of Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; this award is very much , &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; because she is not only awarded for spor@@ tive successes but also for social commitment . &quot;
for decades , Lan@@ ger promotes the offspring .
and so he continued the prize money of 25.000 Euro .
with 15 other outstanding athletes , the two @-@ time US master winner was induc@@ ted on Saturday in the &quot; Hall of Fame of German Sports . &quot;
among the excellent includes the athletes of Hart@@ wig Gau@@ di and Harald Schmit@@ t , the fai@@ ries Corn@@ elia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the o@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ ek@@ e , the E@@ rec@@ ite Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ er@@ le and pos@@ thum@@ ously the Hand@@ b@@ aller Erhard Wonder@@ ful .
many of these sport@@ s@@ men came to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the illustr@@ ative society wander@@ ed into the spring@@ time , where the Lav@@ az@@ za prize was running .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger held distance to the big animals .
Clin@@ tons and Tr@@ um@@ ps Economic Policy Compar@@ ison : it &apos;s All about the Money
invest in infrastructure and prevent the T@@ TP trade agreement - both Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
however , the two US presidential seek@@ ers are , however , in the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental question .
the differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and Hillary Clinton is based on a basic , rather philosoph@@ ical difference .
the role of the state .
tr@@ ump wants to keep in doubt rather small and warns against the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regul@@ ators .
Clinton wants to regul@@ ate and regul@@ ate the economy and regul@@ ate death , he says .
he himself would be completely different , asser@@ ts Tr@@ ump .
he will advance regul@@ ators mas@@ sively , and he advoc@@ ates a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private persons and for companies .
Clinton said : the state has certain tasks to fulfil , he has dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities to open , and needs money for it .
therefore , taxes for the rich would be increased , they say .
Inter@@ est@@ ingly , both are very close to infrastructure .
in the nuts inv@@ ests , Tr@@ ump and Clinton say almost to the same .
the democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programmes in the infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are rejected by the government @-@ critical Te@@ is@@ y @-@ wing of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
so , on Tr@@ ump , there could be still a part@@ isan discussion .
the differences in energy and climate policies are more clearly .
tr@@ ump wants to build coal power plants and re@@ build the coal mining in the US .
oil extraction should also be possible in so far protected territ@@ ories that he wants to cancel the Paris Climate Agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton with their investment programme explicitly wants to expand and demands renewable energies with their investment programme : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a country will create the super power of clean energies and create millions of jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want it to be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements the two competitors are not too far from each other .
T@@ PP , the transp@@ azi@@ fish trade agreement , both do not want to sign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , both do not want to isol@@ ate international trade from international trade , but simply use American jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they should then be paid better , some Clinton calls for .
the current minimum wage of 7,@@ 25 U.S. dollar is a hunger re@@ warding .
it wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour .
what Tr@@ ump wants to do in this question is not clear : once , he says : the minimum wage does not have to be changed , then he says he will not be changed .
but the big discussion of the coming months is likely to develop the control policy of both camps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on one hand , Tr@@ ump , who wants to discharge the economy and its citizens to boost growth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his critics keep him before , so that the budget deficit would only grow bigger .
on the other hand , Clinton wants to ask at least from the rich they want to pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution .
escape : &quot; every cher@@ ished woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot;
sexual violence belongs to women who have fled alone , almost daily .
when they arrive in Germany , they are often traum@@ ati@@ zed .
a house provides refuge .
in a large kitchen there are four women .
each one has a baby , which is at most a year old .
one has put her little son into his arm .
he looks curious with big eyes in the room .
his mother star@@ es at the table top .
until it noticed that it is observed .
she sm@@ iles short and kissed the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
until you speak with Katrin B@@ ahr .
she is Managing Director of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social support in Bavaria , and deals with the subject of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are wing@@ ed .
they live in the Munich north in one of the few dec@@ entr@@ alised accommodations for women and their children in Bavaria .
in January Con@@ dro@@ bs opened up the facility with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich &apos;s welfare service .
un@@ long she has been officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men do not exist - also not as visitors .
the exception is a watch@@ man in front of the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated to say : every woman who reaches here , has made experiences with sexual violence , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee because of wars , because they are politically persecuted due to them torture or death , or because their families will send them as a hope of hope in Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she tells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in women there were no other reasons for the escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many steal away secretly because they don &apos;t see any other way out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in their home , they have experience with sexual violence , forced , hon@@ esty , slavery or forced prost@@ itution .
this is driving them away .
on the run goes on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , if a bottle of water is a sexual act , no rarity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
who believe that , as soon as they anchor in Germany , B@@ ahr rel@@ ates .
here too many women in refugee camps would often be regarded as inferior and worst .
this leads to some 90 percent of women who live in the north of Munich , trau@@ mat@@ ised , estimates them .
&quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntary . &quot;
many women are so familiar to say nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they don &apos;t dare to speak openly about the living , because the shame is too great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because they often don &apos;t need to help you , more than just for them , calls for B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria , the seven district regulations for the accommodation of refugees are responsible .
on the question of whether they would w@@ ager from a similar project as in Munich in their scope of jurisdiction , some respond with no .
there is something like in the Ober@@ pf@@ alz and Ober@@ fran@@ ken .
also in Schw@@ aben , women alone won &apos;t be accommod@@ ated separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , press coverage of the government .
in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Mittel@@ fran@@ ken there are covered floors or own houses only for single women and their children .
the exception is Nieder@@ bay@@ ern , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Committee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rights of Women and Gender Equality also calls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament that women must be split separated by men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a study published for the committee , it is said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important that men and women are separated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; l@@ acks privacy , or are men and women together , it may lead to - ongoing - violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
above all , the wash@@ rooms should be separated and easily accessible to women , stands in the study .
how much the women feel in need of this reserve , you can read off the rush , who gives it to the house in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since we &apos;ve been talking about it , we have a long queu@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you could easily make a second house .
investig@@ ational denti@@ sts : demands on new labor disputes
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the assistant of the Regist@@ rar have called upon their union to appro@@ ve new labor disputes regarding their disputes regarding a new contract . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has demanded its entire council to appro@@ ve more jobs from the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC said that there was ministers agreed to go to the concerns about the contract .
resident students and medical students have agreed on the re@@ jection of a contract in July , which has been agreed with BM@@ A .
he was rejected by 58 % of his members voted in the elections .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to members who was published on Thursday evening on Twitter , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; har@@ r@@ ently cal@@ m@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; problems , which led the contract to be rejected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of this , the J@@ DC Board has agreed to fully reject the proposed new contract and requests an official trial to all your concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Board today filed a formal application for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to appro@@ ve a running program of sustainable working cycle , which begins early September to appro@@ ve .
the disputes resulted in the fact that Assist@@ enz@@ ologists stri@@ pped six times this year , the first overall fail@@ ures in the history of N@@ HS .
according to the election , the BM@@ A assist@@ ants Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana retired after the election to re@@ jection of the agreed contract conditions , which were recommended by the BM@@ A .
he shared BM@@ A members during the meetings that still took place prior to vote by 54@@ .000 assist@@ ants and medical students that the contract should be advant@@ ageous and accepted .
after the vote , the health minister Jeremy Hun@@ t said that the contract for doctors would be for@@ ci@@ bly introduced in England .
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; Alliance of Foreign Policy &quot; ?
it was a gest@@ ure that ended a crisis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to surrender hands and proc@@ laim an official end of the eight month &apos;s war of words and economic sanctions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish opponent in the gold @-@ g@@ ild@@ ed hall of the St. Petersburg Pal@@ ast@@ es reception , I cannot stop myself from the tru@@ sting that Ankara doesn &apos;t want to reject this reconciliation .
there was the envelope , yes .
but Putin &apos;s smile worked dirty , and he hardly radi@@ ate warmth , even for his restra@@ ined conditions .
however , Recep Tayyip Erdogan , on the other hand , spoke about his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report all five times .
I couldn &apos;t count it any more .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis but even to improve .
on the next day , a paper describing Erdogan would have happened that it would never happen something bad .
but his enthusiasm seemed to me the opposite .
but one of Putin had a be@@ aming , sustainable cooling showed that Russia &apos;s government had forgotten nothing .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first to mentioned in his introduc@@ tory words : the shooting of a Russian fighter aircraft at the Syrian border through Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was horri@@ fied .
Putin shared out and accused Ankara to be in the back .
leaving it even bigger , since it was committed by an alleged friend .
the cou@@ gh@@ ing re@@ build is difficult , if not even impossible .
the public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for months , the nation@@ ally controlled media carried a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara . &quot; &quot; &quot;
suddenly it seemed like the Turks would carry all the gu@@ ilt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the accus@@ ations of senior officials were that Earth &apos;s own family benefited from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria , controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he denied this v@@ eh@@ ement .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse from President Erdogan as he wanted to hear .
Russia could book a kind of victory .
for Ankara , the benefits of an arm@@ ist@@ ice are obvious .
Erdogan is primarily necessary all friends who he can get after last month during a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat of almost his ministry .
repeated terror attacks on Turkey have also shaken him .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - particularly the ban of charter flights which usually bring multiple millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast .
the number has declined by almost 90 % .
in Russia , travel operators and charter companies will be facil@@ itated if the flights are resumed .
they are counting on an un@@ ison@@ a@@ ison@@ ous ons@@ lau@@ ght of the Mediterranean .
this week the state television predicted fruit and vegetables as soon as Turkish agriculture imports are allowed again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ st@@ i form@@ ulated it as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists stay there long , tomatoes here long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry at the West , as it was a response to the attempted sei@@ z@@ ure of power as a weak answer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the pro@@ longed Gro@@ ll of EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pi@@ ke is to take advantage of the cool mood and reduce the relationship between Turkey to the West . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Russian head of government won in Ankara with security to give a bonus for the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat of the elected state organ@@ e .
this is a self @-@ understanding for Moscow , who has changed a deep @-@ sitting fear of regim@@ es itself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the summit meeting in this gl@@ itter@@ ing palace in the sea enabled Russia and Turkey , one as described as an analy@@ st , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alliance of Foreign Affairs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : two countries that over@@ threw themselves from the West and are now banned . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two still .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the largest difference is Syria , where Moscow has recently issued the role as a peace maker , but Russia and Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it could be indic@@ ative that after almost three hours of first convers@@ ations , both presi@@ dents say on the press conference that they had not even stri@@ ped the issue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the President of Turkey deliber@@ ately disc@@ ards answer to a question about their differences while Putin decided to emphas@@ ise this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no clear con@@ sens@@ us about where a common den@@ omin@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of an open host@@ ilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect dis@@ aster than NATO member Turkey - it certainly is better that the two leaders talk at least once again .
Royal Bank of Scotland not available for customers outside of Scotland
the R@@ BS brand will only be reduced to a back office roll according to the Chairman of the Bank .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside of Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan shared the BBC Scotland that R@@ BS brand had joined the Bank &apos;s global amb@@ itions .
the Bank has since been dist@@ ressed , when it had to be almost collapsed almost eight years ago and had to be saved .
in this time , brand str@@ ate@@ ways &quot; R@@ BS &quot; have used to protect other end users .
she supported the international sport with millions of pound at sponsor@@ ing , from the Six Nations Rug@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Murray .
but now she has decided to put more national brands in the focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will be available only for customers in Scotland but will not initi@@ alize .
in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , head office and the stock market share will change to Nat@@ West .
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other smaller stamps for the private customer shop that will get more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ WAN was inter@@ viewed by customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Sh@@ ire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he shared the BBC Scotland : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the RS@@ B brand will become our investment stamp and the brand that our employees will be busy , as we are now more to become a bank of brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the Bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS has become a global brand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am now saying that we don &apos;t pursue global targets , but track local targets . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each of these brands will be totally different in their own communities for something completely different and our employees will work among these brands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
R@@ BS has already said that it will not be able to continue its Six Nations sponsor@@ ship , and that it will increase the perception of various brands in its sports sponsor@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is time for us to evol@@ ve to the bank of brands , as we concentrate on the inside ( we asked ) to make this to a better bank for clients ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the manager . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been very cy@@ n@@ ical three years ago , if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and launched these brands .
but with our work , focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you &apos;ll see many changes .
we can launch these brands again , so I think that time is come .

he set on Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction which is trained by John Gos@@ den , on his local race track with his second win of the night a milestone .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth Jo@@ ckey which reached the milestone in the flat race .
he succe@@ eds Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Doug Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ g@@ ott , Pat Ed@@ dry and Willi@@ e Car@@ son .
the three @-@ day winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who had won on G@@ ha@@ y@@ y@@ ar , said , &quot; It is something special . &quot;
I &apos;m very emotional because my family is here too
I am very happy that it will happen at New@@ market because I landed here 30 years ago .
it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ quet Friday evening with 20.000 people .
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori tak@@ eth the Ju@@ l when he brings victory at Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction
two Jo@@ ck@@ ey@@ s reached the milestone in obst@@ acle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y who reached over 4,@@ 300 victories in a record @-@ breaking career .
L@@ ester Pig@@ g@@ ott , the nin@@ ety D@@ erb@@ ysi@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career points
Frank@@ ie is one of the best Jo@@ ckey der Moderne and it &apos;s no surprise that he reaches this milestone , which only few reached before him .
he has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical intel@@ lect , who differs him from the other in the weight control room .
he &apos;s fantastic amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors for race , enthusiasm and charis@@ ma for years already for this sport .
I said Frank@@ ie a couple of weeks ago at Ep@@ som , that he had already scored 6,000 prizes if he was not only a weekend and big tur@@ ni@@ b@@ jo@@ ckey !
Frank@@ ie has already suffered almost 30 years of winners , which is great .
he has a vivid personality , which is good for a British race , but beyond that he is an incredible jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
from Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the fig@@ ure@@ head of the British flat @-@ floor for two decades .
it was annoying .
a whole series of major tournaments , including his famous &quot; glorious seven &quot; 1996 in As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and received a drug prohibition .
three years ago he had in the beginning of trouble when he returned from his six months lock , but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to with@@ stand his branches and to return to its top shape .
and he is still not at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori has said before , that he wants to continue his at least 5@@ 0,@@ ten years before competitions .
Russia &apos;s Putin fired up Chief of Staff Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has reli@@ eved his Chief of Staff Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was part of Putin &apos;s close confi@@ denti@@ ality collection .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed Special Repres@@ ent@@ ative for Environmental and Transport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an opinion of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , it is that Putin have ordered the dism@@ iss@@ al Ivan@@ ov@@ s of his duties as chairman of the Russian President . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who had been the deputy commander since 2012 , was appointed to his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is former diplom@@ at .
born in Tallinn in 1972 , he graduated from the renowned Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in Tokyo &apos;s Embassy in Tokyo .
on the site of the Kre@@ m@@ lin it is called ( in Russian ) that he later became log head and Chief of heads of the government .
he said to Putin about his appointment : &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as head of heads for legislation and controls on implementation of your instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov asked to leave his position and encouraged V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
convince the smiling faces ?
this stage took place in Moscow .
Serge@@ Ivan@@ ov was a long time one of the closest assurance of Vladimir Putin and works as he worked for the Soviet secret services , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
at a meeting with President Putin that was broad@@ cast@@ ed on TV , both men asser@@ ted that the Chief of Staff went back on his own request .
but despite the smile for the cameras , only a few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
so , is the result of a sort of power struggle ?
nobody currently knows .
but the official claim - that a man , who was called as a potential president once , wants to lead the Russian environmental policy - pushed forward to great ske@@ p@@ tic@@ ism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in his remarks on Putin that are quoted on the site of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It is true that I asked you in a conversation with me this very complicated item - you might almost say - compl@@ ying for four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian President for four years and eight months .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V received the post in December 2011 .
he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin former member of the K@@ GB State Security Service .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Military Service ( FS@@ B ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed Deputy Chairman .
when Putin met the power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people he trusted most .
once it was assumed that Ivan@@ ov could become a second term president of Russia as a third term of putting Putin against the constitution .
but this post was taken by another , close allies of Putin , Dmit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became Prime Minister , before he became President for three and a half years later .
Criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gibson fired after he proposed producers
Gibson was involved in a physical debate on the set of the series in Los Angeles last month .
ABC Studio and C@@ BS Television Studios , which produce the series , announced his resign@@ ation in a joint statement .
Gibson , who played the Special Agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , was ap@@ ologi@@ zed on Thursday before the announcement of his termination .
on the set , it came to artistic differences and dis@@ agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I regret the incident , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details about how the character Gib@@ sons from the series , which will follow a team of FBI agent , will be released , according to the opinion of ABC studios and C@@ BS Television Studios is expected to be published at a later date .

I would like to thank the authors , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans who can only wish for a series .
the planned broadcast of the twel@@ f@@ th season is scheduled for September 28 .
ri@@ dd@@ les for fish that landed in the Ban@@ ff garden
a population of Ban@@ ff called for the identification of fish help , which appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin B@@ ain thinks that it could act with the 75 fish around Sand@@ a@@ ale that were sp@@ elled by a fountain .
Mr. B@@ ain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , published on Per@@ is@@ cope a video of the spectac@@ le in hope that someone could throw some light on the appearance of two inches long fish .
Queens@@ land Crossing : bridge now connected to Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion expensive project is expected to be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the North deck of the Queens@@ land cross@@ ings with the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - which means that the bridge is connected with fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four closing arguments of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Deck b@@ lower &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which approach the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30.000 tonnes .
it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20.000 tons concrete and 46 Sch@@ rä@@ g@@ rop@@ es .
the project is expected to be completed by May 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; economic minister Keith Brown placed a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to go to the bridge from the country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is an historic and symbolic moment to build the Queens@@ land cross@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all witness of an engineering at a truly ep@@ ic degree in this project with over 30.000 ton concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the closure between the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a fin@@ icky activity that require extremely precise toler@@ ances for fit .
in total , almost 79 % of the total bridge cks are on their place and the last section of Dec@@ ks is getting a bed @-@ casting for the deck today , which means that the entire deck is ready to be raised on the bridge to its place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Martin , Director of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Construc@@ tors &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first clas@@ p is a significant milestone in every bridge project . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this fantastic project , the closure of future @-@ setting high@@ - and low @-@ engineering represents .
after the installation of the last street section and its connection with the north tower deck , we had to close the still existing gap on the North and the country side .
this was reached by pulling the northern slopes bridge 700 milli@@ metres south .
this was a massive and very fin@@ icky activity .
massive , because the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 222 meters long , it weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be drawn up at an inc@@ line of about 3 % .
delicate , as the toler@@ ances that the team works , tiny - on each side , they were only a few millimeters .
fortunately everything went very well .
rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men have &quot; happiness still alive &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; happiness still alive &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; after they were thrown by their fishing boat before Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station was closed on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T alarm after a crew observed the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had difficulty to swim in safety while their boat was further moving out of their own strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw how the boat shot near around and put us the worst in front of us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the head of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vince Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately , the strong winds have already blown the boat out of their range until we left water , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat , while the third man died at the age of 60 and was found at the age of 60 without a life@@ jacket .
they all came aboard the board of coast@@ ers and were brought back to the rescue station .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Jones said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three men who were thrown into the water , were lucky to be uns@@ killed and still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the boat engine had a not@@ ch of not@@ ch , but it dis@@ b@@ anded the boat managed by the person who control the boat .
someone has eight more than these men today .
seriously injured - a man &apos;s shift on his ex @-@ girlfriend

he subsequently al@@ armed its sister .

but she could not move him to leave the apartment .
so she went out with her life .
on the road , they met the ex @-@ partner of the man .
when the two women again entered the flat , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old gave his sister to the side , handle his ex @-@ girlfriend .
who builds Braunschwei@@ gs cheap apartments ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and Green Party says : investors &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; investors are expected to be much stronger in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how to react to the bad news that Br@@ uns@@ wick will lose nearly 1,@@ 300 budget apartments in the next few years ?
the SPD suggests a &quot; manual concept living &quot; at the next meeting .
but stri@@ fe is programmed .
first and foremost about the question : who should build the favorable apartments ?
a regulation is missing so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; S &amp; D Group president Christoph Brat@@ mann said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens to build urban areas in the future , 20 percent of all apartments will have to exhibit as social elections in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the favorable rentals can also be found in the stock .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the great dispute in the town hall is , however , as Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how to build investors coming to private areas ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors at least 10 percent , but if possible to build 20 percent of the apartments as social security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new urban housing programme , which will cost millions of money and will be financed , should provide an inc@@ enti@@ ves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the problem , such as Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CDU would like to make investors as few rules as possible .
the left wants to reduce har@@ sh@@ ness to investors .
regardless of its , Brat@@ mann , flag is a deep@@ ening of the situation on the housing market .
the action concept is implemented , which will provide additional tasks within the building management .
more staff is needed .
it is un@@ clear if we get the professionals .
but the programme is not entirely clear : for the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments should be built anyway .
how does one compare the loss of more than 1300 affordable housing that will run out in the next few years ?
by 2020 alone , there will be 500 apartments .
to prevent this , Nicole Palm , plan@@ ing , should now be purchased from the city now .
in addition , it would have to be thought to return flats back into the price .
this is possible in the West town .
the problem can solve one fell s@@ woo@@ p .
because in the West town we run the end of the year .
around 1800 apartments you could get back to the price for cheap apartments .
only : that do not want the owners , the housing companies not .
for the number of social welfare in the western town is once again dra@@ stically increased , the target of the so @-@ called passage of mixing .
there is no concentration of social w@@ aking in just a few parts of the city .
the Gre@@ ens anticip@@ ate that there will be any movement in the debate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; vice @-@ Chair Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a wide majority the CDU must be by boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have focused on more construction sites for family homes .
but what does not mean that there is not yet a compromise can be found .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that pays off
it is fascinating to watch how the world is changing .
that teen@@ ager and child will not go out without any longer , but rather they prefer to spend their free time on screens , was compl@@ ained in the last decade of many .
with Pok@@ emon Go , it &apos;s about getting people from the sofa and become more active .
the time at the screen was on TV , then video games and most recently limited to smartphones .
therefore , it is great to see that technology and activities do not exclu@@ de each other .
I am referring to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app based on characters that were initially created for the video games in the 1990s ( later it created a cartoon series , maps and other spin @-@ off ) .
how many phenomena of pop culture sank the interest in the release of the game in the US , Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July .
the market launch in other countries was shifted by massive demand that over@@ loaded the server .
within a few days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , players with their smart phones go outside and looking for Pok@@ é@@ m@@ ons , who are followed with a GPS and once they have been found , &quot; taken &quot; ( about a screen@@ shot on the phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
a generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the wreck and jumped for the search of the sofa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the U.S. , the game led to a si@@ z@@ able increase in steps which the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; average &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; person put back every day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cardi@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch , followed by a app for Apple Watch , announced the Washington Post recently , that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of people followed by 45 per cent , who jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - only the raw data for improving performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many public awareness campaigns for health , people want to take &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; walk from the sofa &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during 30 minutes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every day actively to be active &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because many public messages are boring for health and coming from people coming to look . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , the importance of sport cannot be over@@ rated .
those who regularly do sports , reduces his chances of developing cancer or depression .
physical activity helps with weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to take them here .
but the wonderful on Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors , making them fun .
three pillars of health covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine and have fun .
some people even close new friends on the hunt .
as always , there are also oral strug@@ gles , which must always complain about anything .
and yes , someone could walk against a door .
what &apos;s it supposed to do ?
it has a breakthrough .
even if smart apps like Fit@@ bit earlier were able to track our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to play sports as it does .
the new will lose its appeal and the use is re@@ done with the time .
because of poker success , however , there will be more games that will unite Apps and virtual reality with the active in the real world and help many people in hunting , more active , fit@@ ter and heal@@ thier .

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in the Dam@@ age
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Simone Bil@@ es is immune to all this .
dynamic on the trampoline .
effort@@ less on the bar .
breath@@ tak@@ ingly on the ground .
definitely brilliant .
and now finally the Olympic Champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American Tur@@ ner@@ in drow@@ ning the gap between themselves and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games .
their overall score of 6@@ 2,@@ 198 was clearly in front of the silver medal and &quot; Final Five &quot; team amer@@ ad@@ in A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze medal Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
the Americans Simone Bil@@ es tur@@ nt on the pig @-@ bal@@ m during the single majority of women in the art tournaments during the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ osex@@ ual American , who wins a multi @-@ campaign and overall the fifth , while it soli@@ di@@ fies its reputation to be the best of its generation or even at all .
she broke out in tears , when her final score was shown and her long journey in that moment was an end .
this success is the same league how unique athletes , like Michael P@@ helps , brought their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ es dominated the last three years her sports art , which includes a mix of am@@ bition and precision - including 10 gold medals , which contain a mixture of am@@ bition and precision that the Olympic Champion of 1984 &apos; Mary Lo@@ u Res@@ on told her that she &apos;s the best gymn@@ ast that I ever saw . &quot;
there was a final exam in Brazil , a competition , which went not so much between Bil@@ es and the Rest of the Ath@@ let@@ es , but rather between her and a burden of over@@ sized expectations .
do not return with a hand@@ ful gold back to the family in Spring , Texas would be considered dis@@ appointment .
the Americans Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace her , after they both won gold and silver in the single @-@ majority of women in the summer season in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es won the first medal on Tuesday , while Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i retired during the farewell party .
although Bil@@ es insist@@ ed on the top , never intended to have the future planned , this is not really true .
part of their ground exercises - which contain their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is tailored to Latin American music , which would fit in the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is not a co@@ incidence .
this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and was discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a school trip to the gym , in the bo@@ or@@ man was trained .
since the summer of 2013 , she has not lost any surplus competition , a winning series that will stop as long as it wishes .
even if Must@@ af@@ ina led lightly by two turns , the picture d@@ ashed .
Schwe@@ be@@ bal@@ ken and Bo@@ dent@@ ur@@ ns - in which Bil@@ es keeps the world title - loud .
she recovered from 15.@@ 4@@ 33 on the Swe@@ de to the Swe@@ de - and replaced it with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground .
Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ ced her gently when she waited for her final suit - a pure form - and tears f@@ lowed upon fine gloss red , white and blue E@@ yel@@ iner , when the vision described them once in her collective book .
the performance Ra@@ is@@ mans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal went in a deep @-@ war , Must@@ afa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ ma &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ ma &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; an advantage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after their emergency exercise she threw up K@@ us@@ sh@@ ale &apos;s audience , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes appeared doub@@ tful .
as for it , the 19 @-@ year @-@ old twe@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ old has a completely new meaning :
police : 3 victims in mass mur@@ der@@ ers shot at the car in the car
according to the police reports that were published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl were shot dead in one of the most deadly attacks since a decade in the first co@@ dec@@ eption of Phoenix while they stopped in the car and heard music .
Angela Rochelle liner , Stef@@ anie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12 when the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , the authorities said .
the perpet@@ rator fired eight shots from a hand@@ hum@@ id weapon while he was standing on the passenger side of the car and fled afterwards with another car , is to be read in the report .
the police told that the tri@@ cky murder has not been the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y , because the att@@ acker took not the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 who took possession of one of the adult victims .
the police exchange of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting of the investig@@ ators managed to become a close look at whether it is connected to four previous attacks .
in total , seven people were killed in nine attacks and two others were injured in nine attacks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Howard of K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , beginning of the month . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is believed that the susp@@ ects has used several vehicles including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to reveal the evidence that they are linked to the conclusion that the attacks are linked and committed to the same mur@@ derer .
Ellis , 33 , was hospit@@ alised and died later .
liner , 31 , and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died still on site .
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for her to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the authorities also published a police report on the shooting , which is purpos@@ ed on an empty pickup truck for half an hour before the triple murder and is assumed that it was the work of mass mur@@ derer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
investig@@ ators found Pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ül@@ sen and secured a ball from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia : &quot; it is better &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old Edmund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and of course his mother .
but as the least of his anti@@ quity , Edmund micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia , the result of a genetic disorder , knew nothing about his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to during her pregnancy .
when he came home the first time , my first thought , I made it not .
I don &apos;t create this .
Wher@@ eu@@ p@@ on I did not let myself down .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what is not right at all -- and of course you have settled it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
your husband Vincent and her husband have been told that Edmund might never recognize them under circumstances and that he may not survive once .
some doctors even went so far that they suggested , to institutional him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my first answer to that was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Edmund can run with the help of a hearing aid .
Edmund could neither sit nor cra@@ ck@@ ling until his third year , nor can he still speak .
but he is making progress slowly .
it can run with support and cycle cycling .
he loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elizabeth shows the sign language that Edmund for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Please sing something out before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bring sign language to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is not a typical sign language -- says it . Edmund has invented a few characters alone .
micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic such as Edmund and infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the c@@ ic@@ av@@ irus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and forecasts may vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how the life of infected with the c@@ ic@@ av@@ irus will affect .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to re@@ members the emotional prize of an uncertain future .
I asked myself , what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she doesn &apos;t really know .
I didn &apos;t ask for the forecast for a long time , because I don &apos;t expect that someone can really tell me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of babies with birth defects caused by the Z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus .
it gets better .
they know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .

Ste@@ ele said that alone the community Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa had claimed ten thousand sand@@ bags .
a flood warning system is used across large parts in the south of Louis@@ i@@ anas up to Saturday .
the weather service provided that there may be additional 3 to 5 inches in this area to rain .
a flood warning system was deployed in the South of Al@@ ab@@ ona , while mobile continues to rain in the area of mobile .
the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs which are both located in Louisiana , are all lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood to reach over the weekend record level .
the Met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers could be flooded with many houses nearby Bat@@ on Rouge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also said that a stream down@@ ward floo@@ ding in Ascension Par@@ ish is a danger since they are only slowly flowing into the Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the river ti@@ fa@@ w , south of the Mississippi border in Liverpool , Louisiana , reached the highest level on Friday at 09.@@ 00 .

L@@ ero@@ y H@@ ans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son found himself among the those who were saved on Friday in the proximity of Glo@@ ster .
H@@ ans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is normally more than 400 feet away from his house , rise overnight .
he said that another step@@ son who lives near , would have warned him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we woke up and the water flows and stre@@ amed in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ ans@@ ford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my wa@@ ist .
his wife said H@@ ans@@ ford to see that she lived there in the 48 years where she had never seen such a high @-@ rise in the river .
H@@ ans@@ ford said that he and his family members would have all disabilities and he would be the only one who can swim .
H@@ ans@@ ford said that emergency hel@@ pers had saved all three in a big military truck and had brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were accommod@@ ated till Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the flood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had spread quickly &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; since it continues to continue heavy rainf@@ alls and that the authorities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; evacu@@ ation instructions &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann , an ob@@ server located near Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning from 13.@@ 75 inches rain .
K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the soil was considerably more balanced since Wednesday .
the authorities appro@@ ve that heavy rainf@@ all and road floo@@ ding inhabitants caused the rescue of inhabitants of their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and S@@ cra@@ ck in five school districts .
the C@@ BS @-@ subsidiary WW@@ L reported that a subsi@@ dy in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa had 200 flooded houses .
the inhabitants were evacu@@ ated in two churches , which now both were flooded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the stand of the church Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities had res@@ cu@@ ed 72 people and seven pets , which were washed away from floods . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency meetings were set up to accommodate the evacu@@ ation .
&quot; as soon as the water starts to go back , they will return to their houses , &quot; he said .
in the city of Ham@@ mond of the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozens of streets were closed due to high water and sand@@ bags for participation , hoping to hold the water from their homes and shops .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last major flood we had , was in March , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the City Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
in Mississi@@ pp the Emer@@ gency Manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Harrison Count@@ ys said that it was still ra@@ ining on the Gulf Coast .
according to his information , a hand@@ ful of houses on Thursday should be announced as floo@@ ding , but no one has been reported on Friday until now .
Keith Town@@ son , manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen water in places where I &apos;ve never seen before , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Town@@ son said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it still comes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crossed out of balls , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; survi@@ ves shooting in Philadelphia
the police divi@@ des that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time that a 6 @-@ year old child is shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boys identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
the grand@@ parents gave that Brown suffered multiple s@@ uss@@ ings , including in the l@@ ende , leg , arm and belly , but that he was in the hospital at his transport to hospital .
&quot; he has gone through a lot , his small body was pier@@ ced by bul@@ lets , &quot; said his grandmother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z to the broad@@ c@@ aster .
I just cannot believe it .
the boy &apos;s condition was classified as critical in a hospital and had to undergo several operations .
the family of the boy shared the broad@@ c@@ aster in which he is expected to recover .
he would have to start the first class in a local primary school .
it was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .
there were also three men : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in a stable state according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the boy was found on the front seat of a car together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old that is located in a critical condition , found on the station .
the other two victims were not found in the car and the police , whether in one of the injured men of the perpet@@ rators .
investig@@ ators distributed C@@ BS Philadelphia with that it seems apparently to be a cross@@ fire between several archers .
cartridge he@@ els for assault rif@@ les , which were tra@@ ced to different assault rif@@ les , paraly@@ zed the crime scene .
it seems that it clearly acted around a lasting struggle .
on the road , on both sides of the hearing , sleeve took place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus it seems to have given several armed fighters who were very actively involved , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said police force Anthony G@@ inal@@ di the police in Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
several homes and vehicles were also met in the area .
there was no arrest and the police currently reports reports according to the surveillance video .
on Tuesday another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl hit the arm when she played in front of her house in the area of West O@@ ak Lane .
she re@@ covers and the police are looking for a susp@@ ect .
why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
this is what I propos@@ e to me among women &apos;s Olympics in the Tur@@ ning Tower , and that is more than one reason .
first , I have been part in every summer Olympics in 1984 and the USA had never been so dominant .
and second : this team has three tur@@ ner@@ ves , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , that inspired many young girls of other skin color .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Je@@ w@@ ess is and Madison Ko@@ cian who is Cath@@ o@@ lic@@ kin , makes everyone proud .
this team finally reflects the US .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and H@@ isp@@ anic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years the number one under female Tur@@ ner@@ ves was an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American woman .
last year , Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were married .
that shows strength .
at the last Olympic Games Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising victory in the Olympic and America jubil@@ ee .
now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three times world championships in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they were unexpected , yet master@@ ful Gy@@ ma@@ st@@ ik@@ rout@@ ines delivered .
on Thursday , Simone was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ osex@@ ual Americans that won with an individual surplus event for women gold .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won Silver .
we are wit@@ ness@@ ing the top of this sport , but you don &apos;t see gym classes all over the country .
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie struck all the same way as A@@ ly and Madison , to create it into the Olympic team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Last Five , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the next Olympic champion is only four gymn@@ ast@@ ics in the team . besides , this is the last year with Marta Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but reality looks like that tur@@ nes is an expensive sport and gymn@@ asts in the first line in private gym that will maintain by parents , which will be maintained for training , furnishing and hotel costs ( for the train@@ ers and their Turner and families ) . the list can be rendered arbit@@ rar@@ ily .
the majority of these train@@ ers lie in wealthy suburbs , which can support the business .
in these clubs the gymn@@ asts of their whole training and that is for families an expensive and long @-@ term commitment .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have trained both their athletes and since they started with Tur@@ ning .
we have to be inspired by the con@@ greg@@ ations of Au@@ n countless , young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , a better and easily accessible gy@@ ms .
I founded my gym of 20 years .
with my events we have offered free and affordable Tur@@ ning in Harlem for about 15,000 stur@@ an@@ te@@ ens ( especially black and h@@ isp@@ anic ) and exerc@@ ised national and international vic@@ tors .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my home town ) to offer the young high quality Tur@@ ning to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport .
Tur@@ ning develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determin@@ at@@ eness for the mind .
this combination offers lifetime advantages for health and training and professional success .
it &apos;s the inspiration of this team that bring thousands of young girls to be interested in the tur@@ nes and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to take part in sports , especially for girls .
that is such an exciting time .
thank you Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Madison for this real portra@@ yal of &quot; Girl Power &quot; through the Hol@@ en of the Olympic team gol@@ ds and thank you who motiv@@ ate so many young girls with different background to start their way , healthy , strong and successful young women .
assist@@ ants want to organise more strikes after it rejected Jeremy Hun@@ t proposal
the ministers had hop@@ ed to end the dispute over changes by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 37@@ ,000 assist@@ ants , who vote in a vote , refused to vote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in July Hun@@ t plans to susp@@ end the treaty and said that the N@@ HS would be in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and any further delay would be harmful for the employees and patients . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first assist@@ ants should get a new contract , which contains changes to night and weekend , in order to improve the care for ung@@ astic times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the president of the BM@@ A Commission for assist@@ ants divided the last night in a communication with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Regist@@ rar &apos;s concerns on the proposed contract , in particular that it will heat the current workforce crisis and prepare it to treat all doctors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with only eight weeks that still remain until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress must be made and the time runs out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; efforts from the BM@@ A contribute to the solution of dispute through talks during the government &apos;s decision to participate and sometimes de@@ af@@ ening silence on de@@ af@@ ening silence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that happened to say that Jeremy Hun@@ t had made it last month for the last month that his door would always open .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jeremy Hun@@ t has to act now , lifting the condition and respond to the wor@@ ries &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he does not do this , the assist@@ ants have made it clear that they are prepared to carry out further work processes .
the last strike at the end of April saw an elev@@ ation of almost 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 Termin@@ es , since nur@@ ses and specialists were included to grant doctors in strike @-@ post cover .
the ministers had hop@@ ed to end the dispute through an acceptance of the reform@@ ist treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association .
the BM@@ A would like to pay a better week of week for the 54@@ .000 assistance operators who are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director General of N@@ HS employees , called for the assistance to stop the strike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; labour @-@ workers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not achieve a bit of labour , but already over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare the patients , fo@@ ster and their families only trou@@ bles , emergency and inter@@ ruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past two months , we spoke to the Com@@ intern of Assist@@ ants and to the Ministry of Health and other minist@@ ries positively to the concerns regarding the gu@@ ardi@@ an@@ ship and the wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ ars .
the employer hop@@ ed that the continuing positive commitment to other important topics - such as post@@ ing , flexibility in training , education , mutual recognition and gender equality , education , health education , and the Ministry of Health regarding the observ@@ ance of the agreements with BM@@ A in November , February and May .
the £ 2 @-@ per day medication that can reduce heart attacks
thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per @-@ day medication , advised by the authorities to submit more people for a longer period .
the mat@@ ing drug Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for persons with a heart disease .
this medication is administered for 12 months after a heart attack , reducing the risk of stroke or a further heart attack .
the N@@ HS regul@@ ators N@@ ICE of the N@@ HS has been recommended for four years to reduce the risk of cardi@@ ov@@ ascular problems further .
the N@@ HS regul@@ ators N@@ ICE of the N@@ HS has been recommended for four years to reduce the risk of cardi@@ ov@@ ascular problems further .
about 14@@ 0,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of it suffer a further heart attack or stroke .
heart attacks and stro@@ kes are caused by cultivation of fatty material in the arter@@ ial walls , form the pads .
if the layer break apart , it can cause a blood cl@@ ots causing blood flow to the heart and caused a heart attack .
if the blood cl@@ ots sol@@ ves , it can flow through blood flow and c@@ logging blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke .
people who had already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk .
Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ ec@@ a and is driven under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots .
the design draft of N@@ ICE , which was published today , recommends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with an twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE Health Technology Center , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all those who suffered a heart attack or a stroke - often with des@@ ks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fear of a new heart attack can have considerable negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
the experience shows that Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with aspir@@ in effectively reduces the reduction of further heart attacks and stro@@ kes in people who had a heart attack .
thanks to a preliminary recommendation of Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to expand the options available to thousands of people who can benefit .
the information on the efficacy and safety of Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of blood - is limited to a period of up to three years . the institution recommends no treatment that goes beyond this period .
Culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ ness makes const@@ itu@@ encies in Muslim regions
former Mayor Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man &apos;s former Mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ man was removed from office last year due to corruption from the office
a culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ ness has led to that widespread election fraud in Muslim communities may be ignored as a cr@@ ushing government report today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Cab@@ inet of Sir Eric Pic@@ kl@@ es attacks the police , election ob@@ servers and Rath@@ thou@@ ses to have ignored the evidence of electoral abuse due to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ no and religion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former Minister of Integration and Commun@@ al@@ im , who is now an anti @-@ corruption , said that the in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation of voters from religious mot@@ if@@ s would be so bad that it should be allowed to protect bul@@ locks outside of const@@ itu@@ ency to preserve voters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he recommends that voters should lead a reference to their identity in elections .
at the moment , a v@@ oter must name his name and address .
the report proposes un@@ th@@ ink@@ able ink on the fingers of a person if they re@@ vo@@ ke their election , to prevent someone twice .
wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lower should maintain more protection , says Sir Eric .
it demands that the press should have access to local documents and decisions of non @-@ official commis@@ sions or working groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not only for election fraud , but is also to protect the municipal government in front of the bro@@ ader corruption and financial concrete culture that en@@ vis@@ es , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was arranged by Down@@ ing Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ lets Elec@@ tr@@ and@@ als in the east of London .
last year , a special court decided that the current mayor Lut@@ on Rah@@ man should be named after a lit@@ an@@ ei at corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the court found that Rah@@ man would have per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in cy@@ n@@ ical way &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that he would have put his critics with ra@@ cial and Islam@@ opho@@ bic accus@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man should have led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his campaign on the basis that it is the reli@@ ance duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to 300 voices were either doub@@ tful or the result of an im@@ itation which one person chooses someone else .
Sir Eric said that there were evidence for fraud throughout the country .
he expressed himself in particular al@@ ar@@ ming to frau@@ dul@@ ent post@@ age - at the older members of the Muslim community , people had made pressure on people to vote for their choice .
Sir Eric , pictured , made several recommendations to su@@ ck@@ le the electoral system , including the guide of commit@@ ments to prove the identity
&quot; &quot; &quot; in his report it says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as proof , pressure on top @-@ needy members of some ethnic min@@ orities has been exerc@@ ised , in particular women and young people to vote in accordance with the will of the elders , in particular communities with Pakistan or ban@@ qu@@ ish background . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were concerns that ... state institutions would have ignored such behaviour as a politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; su@@ peri@@ ority of eth@@ nic@@ ity and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; To clean the system , including the ban that political activists edit mail papers necessary to stop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ ap &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report , which is drawn by Ther@@ esa May , also requires tou@@ g@@ her registration checks to prevent the voting directory for immigration and social security purposes .
consider options to ask v@@ oter in front of your choice after your identification .
do not use removable ink on the finger of a person as soon as she has given her voice to prevent someone to pick up twice .
systematic checks about the nationality of a person carry out to ensure they are optional .
a three @-@ year limitation on request to an automatic post@@ age .
prohibition that political activists process complete letters and env@@ elop@@ es of letters .
police shall give the authority to establish bul@@ locks on const@@ itu@@ ents .
a bill of legislation carried out an indictment against in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation according to the re@@ pression of the People Act 1983 ( national law in 1983 ) .
photography in electoral stations .
requirement that only English in the electoral stations may be used ( except for Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training , to ensure that the employees generally asser@@ t that voters can go alone to the Cab@@ inet alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric falls about the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ast@@ o@@ unding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets you don &apos;t have criminal complaint . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the electoral court has told Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his deputy for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices than un@@ tau@@ glich . &quot; he said .
it was adequ@@ ately known due to a number of reasons - according to the high requirements in criminal proceedings - guilty .
he also critic@@ ises the effective &quot; Ab@@ ha@@ k@@ checks &quot; of the Elec@@ toral Coun@@ sel@@ ing Not@@ ices of the Rath@@ thou@@ ses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Court of jurisdiction in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our country carries the mother of parliament a proud legacy , but the wor@@ rying and conce@@ aled spreading of const@@ itu@@ ency and den@@ ial of some authorities are threat@@ ening this good reputation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
crazy about K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gän@@ gger and other famous Doppel@@ gänger of Olympi@@ as@@ port@@ lern in Rio
fans of the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio will be touring this week via the French cycl@@ ist Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot , besides the border and band that proved to be an impressive double vo@@ cal@@ ist of the Du@@ chess in Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olymp@@ ion@@ ik@@ in is by far not the only to have gold fighting athl@@ ete , who has his own famous Doppel@@ gänger . at least not when you grant the social media faith .
in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces , who fli@@ pping over time on our screens , F@@ email has created a lists of Olymp@@ ion@@ ics , which have more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Holl@@ y@@ wood@@ land .
the h@@ unter and the wolf : team member of the U.S. team at Ar@@ cher@@ y Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , is compared since his childhood with Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o
besides the applic@@ ant on the race track , many people appeared on the internet as a certain she@@ ar of Di@@ dy@@ mus of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o could be .
the team member of the US team at Ar@@ cher@@ y Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has created an ons@@ lau@@ ght on Twitter , after images on which he sees the Wolf of Wall Street Star un@@ c@@ anny .
in fact , the she@@ et@@ cher received the mad@@ ness in social media and gave it to hear that he has already seen since his childhood , that he looks like Leo .
&quot; I don &apos;t see great simil@@ arity , except the facial hair , &quot; Bra@@ dy said the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post .
&quot; he is a hand@@ some guy , so I really hate it as a compli@@ ment . &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year : the asc@@ ending simil@@ arity between British Weit@@ inger Greg Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris .
the Russian gymn@@ ast of Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with its big , expres@@ sive eyes is supposed to go through to the Cuban American singer Gl@@ oria E@@ ste@@ fan .
and in the swimming pool the South African swi@@ mmer Cameron van der Bur@@ gh is compared with Gle@@ e Star Matthew Morrison .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one step higher : this user is the view that Nathan is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; athle@@ tic acting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; actor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
another comparable comparison has been drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h hard which is similar to eyebrows and lips .
the Russian silver medal winner Yu@@ lia E@@ f@@ im@@ ova has more than just the sun @-@ bre@@ wed skin and blonde hair as the actress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the American Nathan Adrian von Fans was tested , a &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : soccer star Hope Solo , left , and Dexter actress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar visual form and eyes
not the only one : a Twitter @-@ User has been very happy that other simil@@ ar@@ ities have also fallen apart .
theory in the space : according to this user , there is perhaps a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Twitter user stated their satisfaction that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope und Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the US football star Hope Solo and the Dexter actress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter had an incredibly similar visual form and eyes .
another popular compar@@ isons by Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical with the actress Laura Lin@@ ney , and the gold med@@ alists in the Tur@@ ning Gab@@ by Douglas , which shows her own beautiful , broad smile that re@@ sembles the Bring It On Star Gabrielle Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ BC comment@@ ator for the Olympic Games exc@@ uses for his statement that Chinese swimming pools is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a pig . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Byron Mac@@ Donalds Analysis on the fourth place of the 14 @-@ year old Ai Yan@@ han at d@@ r 4x@@ 200m Free @-@ flo@@ cked people of the C@@ BC live broadcast of the Ol@@ m@@ yp@@ ian Games on Wednesday
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Canadian transmitter C@@ BC had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze after one of its comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese swi@@ m@@ pool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and during the race as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a pig died . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the comment@@ ator Byron Mac@@ Donalds thought that his microphone is turned off when he finished his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 200m Free @-@ s@@ wimm@@ ers .
Mac@@ Donald who had been brought aboard the C@@ BS on board to give more &quot; colour &quot; could be heard to say : &quot; this small 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
too excited , went as M@@ ief , died like a pig .
thank you for that .
the Chinese swi@@ m@@ pool in Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , sw@@ am the second stage of the swimming pool 1 : 5@@ 7,@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada Taylor Ru@@ ck , which allowed the Canadian to close the gap to China .
viewers in Canada acted quickly after they were shocked by the sound and speech .
Em@@ met@@ t Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ aked , &quot; Did the C@@ BC comment@@ ator just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old s@@ wimm@@ ers from China &quot; like a pig died ? ? ? ?
the idi@@ ot has not capit@@ ated that they were still on show . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ai Yan@@ han from China was described as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this small 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese colony has lost the connection , baby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the criticism against Byron Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came fast and hard , with which many talk to him
Twitter users didn &apos;t look back when they heard how un@@ sensitive Byron Mac@@ Donald was
another Twitter user friend Sarah Paradi@@ s wrote : &quot; Wow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald .
you first represent the C@@ BC and Canada and makes us all look like sh@@ aver@@ s . # attached .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a short time later , Scott Rus@@ sel , who hosted the C@@ BC programme , was broadcast live for the comment of Mac@@ Donald , saying : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze that the commentary was broad@@ cast@@ ed on a bu@@ oy@@ ancy rate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was a mis@@ erable phrase , we are sorry that it is happening . &quot;
C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed at the end of over 90 times with the people who responded to the comments on Twitter
the comment@@ ator of Scott Rus@@ sel has to ap@@ ologi@@ ze on Mac@@ Donald &apos;s name .
C@@ BC copied and added his excuse for more than 90 other Twitter users who compl@@ ained about Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comments
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and released a message .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we regret it right that these statements were made and that it was enabled to be broad@@ cast@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
yesterday night we ap@@ ologi@@ zed to our viewers so far with our viewers in the social media .
to realise one , Byron &apos;s comments related to the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and not on them as a person .
nevertheless , they were in@@ adequate and an un@@ fortunate wording . Byron does what he said is very sorry .
on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ Donald announced in the programme and tried to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment to excuse me for the comment I made after the women &apos;s s@@ wimm@@ ers in the C@@ BC Olympics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I took me on the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and is not related to them as a person . &quot;
of course there was no dis@@ regard intended , and I &apos;m very sorry . &quot;

the buyer did not know where to look at when a woman wi@@ ped her clothes in the midst of a pri@@ mark to try under@@ pants .

she continued and tested four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop at Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ est@@ one .

&quot; &quot; &quot; a mother of two children , Jenny Davi@@ d@@ son , who was at the same time in business , said that after the mysterious woman had tried the under@@ wear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she left again and left the shop without buying anything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she said , &quot; People could not believe what they saw . &quot;
in the middle of the sales area she took a pair of under@@ pants from the outlet , pulled her own shr@@ ubs and pants and tested them .
&quot; they did not even find a somewhat dis@@ astro@@ us place to do it - it just stood there , fre@@ ch as O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone star@@ ed when she pulled off the under@@ pants , which you obviously didn &apos;t like it , because they put them back to the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she repeated the same thing with three other under@@ pants before she finally decided that you didn &apos;t like anything , again anz@@ og and r@@ aus@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t seem to mind that someone watched us - or about the person who would buy the under@@ pants , who would have tried it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; woman Davi@@ d@@ son , 33 who lives in K@@ ent said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How do people think that someone would take home with home , who had a different person and who have not been washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ms. Davi@@ d@@ son added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I have received , the employees tried to draw the garments of the sale after they went - which is just as good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate it to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants and find out that another woman got them and didn &apos;t get washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man from Pri@@ mark said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that occurred on Tuesday 9th August in our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a against arms attacks
the world outside is a dangerous place but this video of D@@ ail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com might make him more secure for you .
we talked with Rh@@ on Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at the near distance .
regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or back , this video will show you the ske@@ wer of your inc@@ ense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you are back from behind , you should turn yourself up as vom@@ iting , so you can see your att@@ acker and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; go out of the Line &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
grab the weapon then between your front arm and your shoulder before you hit him with your free el@@ bow .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; beat him with his knees on his knees and turn , while the att@@ ack@@ ers go together against pain , the weapon out of his hands . beat him with the run and move forward while they move the weapon to him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with att@@ ack@@ ers , which approach from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the Line , grab the weapon and turn them away so that the att@@ acker cannot shoot .
at the same time , you shift the weight onto the weapon and beat the att@@ acker on your chest , then turn off the weapon out of his handle before moving backwards and raise the weapon on him .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it does Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
but remember that it is the saf@@ est in a rob@@ ber@@ y , your money is to be ski@@ pped - if you are not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand Master .
travel Ian Wright sh@@ uts out his tongue to the dirty places of Europe
a British trav@@ eller under@@ took his immune system and Wür@@ ger@@ ef@@ lex - by taking some of the most dirty and most vulner@@ able places of Europe .
the moder@@ ator and travel author Ian Wright , 51 , from Suff@@ olk shot his course on a euro shot , a ban@@ ker at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a washing machine in Russia to put the resi@@ li@@ ence of its immune system under proof .
before the le@@ aking of each object he used a L@@ umin@@ ometer to show up and show us , on what he will let .
but the experiment that was filmed under the title &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; brought some surprising results in daylight .
the idea to block the sc@@ roll button of a train toilet , which was already used by thousands of others , may be completely revol@@ ting , but actually in a kitchen sink more bad bacteria .
on his journey through Europe , Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria and its own health .
fortunately , nothing left what he le@@ aking , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth .
Mr. Wright was known to test the resistance of its intest@@ ines by travelling through the world and ate wonderful things .
from public funds to train stations up to flush buttons of toilets , the task set his immune system definitely under a sample
&quot; &quot; &quot; he told me in the film : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a child , I was relatively in@@ worried about my health and I have put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , worms and mud water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the film , he was certainly just in his reputation .
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
its pro@@ mul@@ ch showed a L@@ umin@@ omet@@ ry of more than 4000 units .
in comparison with this , the number of freshly washed hands is less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet that he refused to wi@@ pe off after their L@@ umin@@ omet@@ res had over 4000 units , while freshly washed hands have one out of less than 60
Mr Wright and the Finnish producer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the bacterial number of different places like the bathroom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what I smo@@ ked in a toilet , close . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing dirt than that !
I &apos;m not going to so@@ ck here , because it is inside .
the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company uses Mr Wright with Vali@@ o Ge@@ fil@@ us , which contains both lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the extraction of intestinal bacteria and the immune system .
vali@@ os Senior Venice President for Snacks , ju@@ ices and new categories N@@ iko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we wanted to provide the consumer for a really new .
something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the advantages of pro@@ biot@@ ics .
we led crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ings through which we finished that we call &quot; L@@ ass us Ian . &quot;
they claim that interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon
instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them into a bigger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and the documentary we could provide more information in an interesting way to consumers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor !
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the film of the film , added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me say that I had lost my respect for Ian , if he had tast@@ ed some of the things I have instructed to lick him , like the ek@@ el@@ ty Russian toilet that will be shown in the film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , there were things in which it was easier to put Ian to lick them and others , in which this was quite difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad we recorded some of these dirty le@@ aks on film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in one of the conducted survey conducted by the year 2015 , 84 per cent of all respon@@ dents in lac@@ tic acid bacteria were associated with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ine and 58 percent , that at least occasionally products they contain the enclosed lac@@ tic acid bacteria .
A@@ social family devast@@ ated prior to Del@@ og@@ ation Social apartment in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
a as@@ par@@ o@@ cial family left her social house after a del@@ og@@ ation with a damage of £ 50,000 because they wre@@ cked their neighbours .
T@@ anya K@@ hr@@ cock and her partner Sh@@ aun Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown into a long list of complaints from their estate in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after they were ra@@ ped from their property , the residential co@@ operative has owned the property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition .
the walls appe@@ aled , wooden poles were consumed , rub@@ b@@ ish was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ffiti was lubri@@ cated on walls .
the family were res@@ ett@@ led and it is believed that she now lives in a private accommodation
Donna Mc@@ Ev@@ oy , who works for the property management at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said they were afraid that the apartment was no longer allowed to repair .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare for the people here and I am the view that people don &apos;t have to live in this way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many things to consider because this property probably is considered not as beautiful part of Corn@@ walls .
the family is in@@ famous and its reputation is also .
the couple had three sons who had lived in the apartment , and the police said that terror who had joined the family with bas@@ eball bats , in@@ ti@@ mi@@ ths of residents , drug abuse , drug stores , and excessive cri@@ es , stre@@ ches and flu@@ kes .
skel@@ don , 47 , whose name stood on the lease agreement was an arrangement for ant@@ is@@ o@@ cial behavior in June .
in some rooms of the house which will be torn down under circumstances , old garbage was found .
there were in the property where drugs were traded in the past , the wooden legs are lined up
neighbors said they had to struggle on the street and rec@@ alled to the police regularly
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing del@@ og@@ ed her and her partner this week for@@ cible by the property after they gave them an extended period of 11 weeks to be voluntary .
the Del@@ og@@ ation were che@@ ered by lighten@@ ed neighbors who said that their lives was made hell .
one said , &quot; They failed to no one . &quot;
we lived for 20 years beside them and it was always bad .
the countless times we say the police are amazing .
&quot; tomorrow we could not sleep . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used !
now , where they are gone , it will be beautiful .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it had given the family to cooperate with local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police was inv@@ oked in regular intervals , 20 years
on the over@@ grown side of the village , tr@@ ash and old toys were thrown down
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a shame that the ten@@ ant ab@@ duc@@ ers to accept any responsibility for their behavior and family , as always the final step is to consider Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extremely difficult and their do@@ ings had to look aw@@ ful for their neighbours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the community that have dealt gra@@ ce@@ fully on us and have given us the information we have done . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbours and convey@@ s the message that ant@@ is@@ o@@ cial behaviour is not toler@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times , but that they were all over 20 .
a dirty mattress that hides in one of the bedroom of the house after the del@@ og@@ ation on the ground .
workers in the house management are now needed land@@ scap@@ ed rooms that surround the house
in 2014 , the police led a raid on the house and found over 70@@ g of cannabis as well as orph@@ ans , par@@ ap@@ ers and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
Skel@@ et@@ sk received a fine @-@ sentence after she had found guilty of the owner of a class B in commercial sight .
they claimed that money for a tom@@ bst@@ one of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who died in 2013 with a car accident .
after they were without Ob@@ d@@ ach , it is assumed that T@@ anya and its partners are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth .
many rooms of the house were gra@@ ffiti with gra@@ ffiti .
the police says that they will del@@ og@@ ate their ten@@ ants , who do not keep up to the house rules
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Angela Cro@@ w from the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall shared that the del@@ og@@ ation would be a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants who do not comply with the rules . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is about those who think they may act without self @-@ awareness as well as to those who were damaged by such a behaviour , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall will never toler@@ ate criminal and national behavi@@ ours which continue to work with partners to protect our con@@ greg@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many vac@@ ation@@ ists who posted video about the dramatic Fly @-@ By in social media , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it flew twice very deep and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ un@@ o Arro@@ ja added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like that the plane would fall down on me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists on the beach of Av@@ eiro were pan@@ icked , when the aircraft came out of darkness and flew incredibly low .
today , the pilot of the Swiss Air Force showed that the pilot of the P @-@ 3C witnessed a training flight on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and so deeply I had to recognise that this is the only way to recognize them .
the spokes@@ man said that the jet due to the bad visibility is slightly deeper than usual in the vicinity , but the air forces continued that the security insist@@ ed at no time at risk .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Flemish fires have destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland by which four people also died on the island of Madeira . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Donald Tr@@ ump grants ″ mighty problems ″ in the election campaign
the leaders of the U.S. rep@@ ubli@@ can have pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive wor@@ ries , even in traditional states states their majority .
Donald Tr@@ ump now gave weakness in Utah to its election campaign in its rep@@ ubli@@ can stron@@ gh@@ old .
a rare moment in which the normally great @-@ lane and confident M@@ ultim@@ illi@@ on@@ aire reported something like concerns expressed as correspon@@ dents .
after he threw 16 ri@@ vals within his own rep@@ ubli@@ can camp , the doubt of his success is growing in the fight for the White House .
&quot; we have tremendous problems in Utah , &quot; said Tr@@ ump to evangel@@ ical Christians who asked for support in major states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia .
gu@@ ilt are false reports of his can@@ did@@ acy , he resumed his well @-@ known media ch@@ oked .
rep@@ ubli@@ can high@@ lands w@@ ack@@ up
Utah is usually a secure bank for the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
a survey conducted by Sur@@ vey@@ s of June of June , Tr@@ ump and his compet@@ itor in Democrats , Hillary Clinton , were equ@@ alled .
other institutes see tr@@ ump in front , but not with the distance that are common to rep@@ ubli@@ can candidates in the state .
Arizona and Georgia are also valid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an interview with CN@@ BC &quot; Tr@@ ump &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; answered Tr@@ ump to the question , as he would stop the advance of Clin@@ tons &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; just as I did it until now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and whether left : this will either be successful or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot;
he doesn &apos;t do anything else than to tell the truth . &quot;
if it does not reach for him at the end of the political correc@@ t@@ ness , that &apos;s okay , Tr@@ ump said .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , the party Tr@@ ump threat@@ ens to cut funds to support its campaign , he should not present better re@@ frac@@ tional values .
instead of whose wool , the candidates call the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans for the Congress more strongly under the arms .
Olympia : dre@@ ister Sc@@ am at D@@ oping Test
the IO@@ C aims to set up a disciplinary commission for the event .
Ken@@ yan athletes pursu@@ es after the second d@@ oping affair during the Rio de Janeiro In@@ gem@@ ach Olympics .
after an attempt at a d@@ oping control in the Olympic Village , Kenya sent a coach to home .
the International Olympic Committee dealt with immediately to set up a disciplinary commission to investig@@ ate the case .
a Ken@@ yan function@@ ary was told that the former Spr@@ inter and present coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , had given an Ur@@ in sample in the Olympic Village at the name of the 800 @-@ meter truck F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich .
this was reported by the team leadership Ken@@ yan by D@@ oping Controll@@ ers .
the IA@@ AF world association has asked the IO@@ C for information about the event to strict management , shared an IA@@ AF speakers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the following measures of the IO@@ C , the IA@@ AF will make a review , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it said in an IA@@ AF declaration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) has gone to D@@ oping control station and signed himself as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Red I , the rehear@@ sal and signed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ken@@ yan boss de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was owned by the Ac@@ credit@@ ation for athletes who stood on the list of training inspec@@ tions in the world anti @-@ d@@ oping agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ er was in 2015 in Peking &apos;s World Cup Four at 800 meters .
four days before , Ken@@ yan Athletics Championships Michael Rot@@ ich has been with@@ drawn from the Rio Olympics .
it is supposed to be informed about cash payments sport@@ s@@ men of his country through upcoming D@@ oping tests .
according to media reports , he was supposed to have been arrested at his return at the Nairobi airport .
Kenya has been under special observation at the IO@@ C after numerous d@@ oping clubs for a long time .
during the announcement of the IO@@ C used more than 2000 d@@ oping destination controls before the Rio Olympics , it was claimed to be noted that particularly athletes from Kenya and Russia are taken into account .
the world anti @-@ d@@ oping agency had put much pressure on African country in front of the summer , an anti @-@ d@@ oping laws and a functioning control system .
the law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympics .
subsequently , the WA@@ DA has Kenya from the list of countries whose D@@ oping fight against the rules of WA@@ DA are .
Kenya is regarded as a big runner @-@ up nation .
the athletes of the country won most medals at the World Cup in Beijing in 2015 .
in a series of television reports the ARD was repeatedly collected , that in Kenya , d@@ oping means easily accessible and there should be a considerable ment@@ ality of sports bet@@ ting .
IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und demanded a similar investigation in Kenya as he hired them in Russian Athletics .
in this case , it was demonstrated that in this sport arena , system@@ atically controlled and system@@ atically controlled .
Russian athletes were then excluded from the summer season .
Salzburg &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Cecilia Bart@@ oli
in the Shakespeare @-@ Year , the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Mary as a tragic couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et .
with this , a surprising Cecilia Bart@@ oli .
a musical conquered Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ st@@ eins master@@ piece .
the artistic director Cecilia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of the classical music and filled with the role of Maria a youth night@@ mare .
in the orchestra pit , the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gust@@ avo Dud@@ amel : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he war@@ med .
we always say that it is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their pace and melody .
it &apos;s a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have Bern@@ st@@ eins music in our blood !
in this st@@ aging , Bart@@ oli plays a very older Lady .
she re@@ members her love with Tony , while the younger daughter plays and dances .
the role of Mary always fascinated me .
first because it is musically exceptional !
and then Mary &apos;s personality would be .
she says it in her song : &quot; I feel Pre@@ t@@ ty , oh so Pre@@ t@@ ty , I feel Pre@@ t@@ ty and wit@@ ty and B@@ right . &quot;
so it &apos;s clever , of course na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passion@@ ately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she re@@ sembles me very much , my Italian character that I have as a ro@@ mer@@ in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dud@@ amel is full of praise for the opera singers : &quot; Cecilia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is so an honour for us to work with her .
she is a tremend@@ ously generous person .
and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; Dud@@ amel is an exceptional artist and very passion@@ ately ! &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
you see it in each of his movements , in his eyes , it &apos;s his life !
it is such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather Southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and a cheerful approach to life , that is very important at all !
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : in this piece it is about pre@@ judi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today we have passed the refugees , then the Pu@@ zzles were going to New York , and the New York inhabitants didn &apos;t want them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are the same issues and they are as meaningful as at that time .
59 years later this piece is still relevant .

&quot; you can only hope that the only good thing is - as a reminder and warning to others , that these are the risks involved in a war zone - people to stop them ever to make this decision , &quot; Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said .
in February 2015 , SU@@ LT@@ ANA and two other pupils from the East London went into a plane towards Turkey and then into a bus to the Syrian border .

Tre@@ ats wants nude calendar for &quot; women and for men &quot;
the Tre@@ ats magazine works with the photographer David Bel@@ lem@@ ere together to launch a 1970 Pi@@ relli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .
but instead of famous naked women she would like to find the next generation of top models for their N@@ U Mus@@ es calendar for 2017 .
the chief editor of Tre@@ ats Steve Shaw told us at the beginning of this year that his neck magazine of vintage @-@ PLA@@ Y@@ BO@@ YS distingu@@ ishes , because &quot; Play@@ boy for men is . &quot;
I do this for women .
apparently he is the view that the calendar also does .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to return to the display of timeless and classical neck , with which both women and men feel good and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Shaw in a press release to publish the Kal@@ end@@ ars . &quot; &quot; &quot;
women are going to participate in this project because it is a beautiful artwork .
models can submit their images online or personally at an open casting call in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kurdish community reck@@ ons with mass cur@@ ses
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he who does not fit and pra@@ ises Erdogan is sitting on caught suit@@ cases , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ near foundation dialogue and world , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the short term , the Kurdish Municip@@ ality of Germany expects to flee from Turkey to Germany in short term .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the medium term , it might even be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several hundred thousand &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; believes the president Ali Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to the harsh action of the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan , after the coup attempt , the Kurdish parish of Germany expects a mass murder to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in short @-@ term , I anticip@@ ate tens of thousands of protection from Turkey in Germany , when the Erdogan regime continues to fight min@@ orities and the democratic opposition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the president Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because the government had moved to Kurdish floo@@ ding with Stra@@ its , the 500,000 Kurds in Turkey are on the run .
after the wart@@ ed coup , ethnic and op@@ positi@@ onal Turks would be added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many will start new in Europe if they continue to op@@ press in Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can not be that a state which himself takes refugees in their own country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chief of Defence appe@@ aled the sett@@ ett@@ lement of Syrian Arab in Kurdish , but also in al@@ ev@@ an towns .
thus Erdogan wants to raise the out@@ flow to the remaining Kurds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the last big minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have already been eradi@@ cated or exp@@ elled in the past few years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also the CDU member . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the government proposed that the Federal Government is positioned as sharp as Austria against Erdogan and its followers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Germany there is also a &quot; witch hunt &quot; against Erdogan critics .
in the last few months , I &apos;m not feeling safe in Germany for the first time .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad .
more Turks are seeking asylum in Germany , especially Kurds and opposition .
the fire market as Gü@@ len @-@ supporters destro@@ ys teachers and other ac@@ adem@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he who does not fit and pra@@ ises Erdogan is sitting on flat rates , by the way also the Kem@@ alists and sec@@ ular , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ near foundation dialogue and education , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as reported by the newspaper , the Turks reported on the figures of the German Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs , the Turks put the largest group of asylum in Germany before the coup .
for the closing date of June 30 , this 11.@@ 386 civilians and thus almost 29 percent of all have been justified ( 3@@ 9.@@ 625 ) .
in this survey , there are no wages of war , poverty or perspective .
asylum right after the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. from state side , individually pursued .
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; where to go where it does &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals get nothing from the Summer Choice campaign - and the tourists from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia don &apos;t have to choose the country day .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood .
the country code will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays , the s@@ ine parliament decided at the beginning of the year .
because it is not so far it won &apos;t be : summer holidays , heat and sh@@ ag@@ ony combat - that bit@@ es itself .
the locals , who are to be convinced by the Elec@@ tors are on vacation .
most of the tourists who are in the country , on Use@@ dom , R@@ ügen , or Hid@@ den@@ see are no natives , so you are not allowed to choose the country day .
in addition , practical problems come : in the holidays they are hel@@ pers st@@ ating posters , infl@@ ating bal@@ lo@@ ons , fl@@ yers , and use the end of the vote , to rub only we@@ ary .
until September 4 , 2016 , the electoral and final day of the day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to aband@@ on its presidential campaign almost over the people .
the hot phase , if one can &apos;t say anything at all , has just begun .
and it &apos;s also about something : Prime Minister Erwin Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CDU coalition , must be afraid of his office .
the SPD , the strongest party , founded in 1998 , is clearly behind the CDU .
exciting is how strong new@@ comer AF@@ D cuts and what remains at the end of the coalition .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 , heads of government , makes an almost un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive election campaign , one sees one of his posters .
he travels through the country , distributed ro@@ ses and ch@@ atting a little with the people , as it did as well as his legend Harald Ring@@ stor@@ ff .
otherwise , Seel@@ ering got cold feet and chan@@ cell@@ or Merkel gives the fault at the blo@@ om of the AF@@ D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their refugee policy , you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We create this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; acceler@@ ates the rise of the sp@@ elling team , which will probably cost him the beautiful post . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CDU with its top candidate , the Minister of Interior , Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is when you make the wrong place for election campaign .
she invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to press conferences twice ; the German Chancellor Angela Merkel lies in the northeast .
but the target group did not agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern and Vorpommern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority of other federal states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , in NDR . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it also failed to listen to anyone from other corners of Germany , to listen to Angela Merkel .
otherwise , the Nord@@ ost @-@ CDU largely refra@@ ined on market@@ places and m@@ alls with umbre@@ llas and bal@@ lo@@ ons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this , coconut , plays only a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; minor role &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Union has noted that you are br@@ other@@ ed on the land that it must be very strict , once again to find a wire to the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the left , the SPD , the Green Party , are barely there in the deser@@ ts of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Council of the CDU @-@ S@@ hat@@ ers Kok@@ ert on his fel@@ lows is also self @-@ exposed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have to go there where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ est , Golden Wed@@ dings , every birthday party must be explo@@ ited . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because much on the game stands , Sell@@ ering has called his SPD as a particularly committed election campaign .
in surveys , the S &amp; D Group was finally defeated by 22 percent behind the CDU ( 25 ) and just before the AF@@ D ( 19 ) .
in the election of 2011 , the SPD was still clearly won by 3@@ 5.6 percent in front of the CDU ( 22 ) .
the Gre@@ ens , small party with seven percent in the p@@ olls , will be able to create the leap into the country day .
they make a modern virtu@@ e from vac@@ ations and aband@@ on their election campaign largely on the internet .
&quot; online election campaign &quot; is the president Claudia Müller .
otherwise , green leaves are embar@@ king on domestic search for domestic voting among the tourists .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ ek , the top can@@ di@@ dat@@ in , curved straight through a house boat through the m@@ ec@@ kl@@ en@@ bur@@ gian lakes and still finds it beautiful .
your impression : &quot; electoral holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is no penalty . &quot;
B@@ 27 Re@@ furb@@ ishment : restaurants suffer from se@@ al@@ ment
on the speed@@ iness , with which the B 27 is rehabil@@ itated , there is nothing to complain .
for those responsible for the construction work , start at 5.@@ 30 a.m. and at 20 o &apos;clock in the morning , there are all praise praise .
&quot; they did everything quite un@@ chy , &quot; El@@ vir@@ a T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff tells of the jet fuel station .
this is a super team .
there is no default .
the construction site could be moved to south until the end of October , everything should be completed by the end of October .
the object is also praised to the construction work , for example when it comes to set up accommodation .
since the construction site was moved to the south on Monday and also the lock of the Asp@@ erg@@ straße in O@@ fan@@ d@@ ingen has been lifted and also the connection to Rot@@ tenburg is again relaxed , the road was relaxed within the resort .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; citizens can now drive back on both sides by O@@ fan@@ d@@ ingen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ev@@ asive traffic by the place seems to go back .
&quot; there were some considerable problems , &quot; says the chief manager Florian King responsible for traffic @-@ related management .
the local residents of Bach@@ straße , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ n@@ erst@@ raße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because many Sch@@ leich@@ ways were looking for and rather to their Nav@@ i as the sign@@ age .
what led to that some truck stops in residential areas .
as the speed limit was not maintained , the parish called to ampli@@ fy the measuring vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were significant trans@@ gres@@ sions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says King who made herself a spot on the situation itself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
just two to three per minute were used .
the quick@@ est was on the speed of 77 km / h in the temp@@ o @-@ 30 zone .
since the construction site has been moved , it is still qui@@ eter .
for business people at the B 27 it is just a small consol@@ ation that the road is now open to customers from Rot@@ tenburg .
business people don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
but the B 27 Re@@ furb@@ ishment has led to their sales revenue , everyone who asks them to look through .
however some more and some are less affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who have less to do with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; end customer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means for other companies , for which the rehabilitation has hardly consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also at the Aut@@ oh@@ aus Mai@@ er , Thomas Sul@@ z talks about a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most slight decline &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but also a fact that of course &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the run@@ way is missing &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most explo@@ ited are the local ones along the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds clear words .
this is already exist@@ ential .
not only him , but all the restaurants made it hard . &quot;
the customers were lacking in He@@ ch@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ tw@@ eil .
we will be happy to be over every euro .
the sales tax amounted to &quot; far above 50 percent . &quot;
the street generation took his operation &quot; by two years . &quot;
he has to have dismissed the half of his staff .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half had been released , politics would have re@@ acted differently .
instead , President Jörg Schmidt put on a request of G@@ öh@@ ner if there might be a financial balancing act , with the reference , the restaurant benefits otherwise from the advantages of the location on the B 27 . now they also have the down@@ sides that carry on through the refurb@@ ishment .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows of other coun@@ ties , where something more generous was handled .
at all suits , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will pass on .
after all , the family business has already been based here since 17@@ 15 , he points to the long history .
that other regular guests are now less often subject to the complex traffic guidance , it can understand .
if you cannot go down , it &apos;s also somewhere else .
after the end of the renovation work , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubts about it .
despite the crises of BSE and a bird flu , G@@ öh@@ ner holds the impact of the B 27 construction work on its cli@@ ent@@ ele , which experienced his restaurant in its long @-@ term history .
six months construction work , which is already brutal .
in the name of the terror attacks is constantly scre@@ wed on laws .
following the latest proposals , Interior Minister of the Minister of Interior , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , is now a th@@ icker security package .
but what does a state status have to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all that ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the verse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all his proposals are politically vulner@@ able to the coalition partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Federal Minister of Interior in the Presentation of his new security box . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they don &apos;t ask anybody .
other , more detailed points would initially be discussed within the parties .
even on it I be@@ mo@@ cked me .
but the Minister of Interior , however , is located in results and con@@ sens@@ us con@@ sens@@ us &quot; within the coalition .
following the latest proposals in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère brought a little time after the recent attacks in Würzburg , before he presented his conclusions for safety in the republic .
but they are all the more extensive .
a lot has already been known , announced , stated , that a new security authority to take care of encrypted communication is not new .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even the fact that Germany has to implement several EU specifications for passenger gas data and arms . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the call for more video surveillance and personal security personnel are also un@@ surprising .
in part , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère starts a second attempt to make suggestions for the SPD to date : he wants to put sympath@@ ies for terrorist groups under punishment and jihadi@@ st jihadists with double citizenship to the German passport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spati@@ t the CDU man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he still hold this still for reasonable and demands nothing at the Ko@@ al@@ ition@@ partner anyway . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few new ideas presented by Mai@@ zi@@ ère .
they have partially in themselves : he plans quick process for dep@@ ort@@ ations and more opportunities for dep@@ ort@@ ations of people before deportation .
refugees that are targeted specifically into the country are to check their smartphone in advance and open social media accounts for security checks before .
in D@@ ul@@ ence for exp@@ ired asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to face some worse than so far - such as such , off@@ ences or their papers deliber@@ ately throw away their identity .
a lot of it is political and legal .
some also still seems im@@ po@@ res and makes questions open .
and with some points - in the im@@ itation of imp@@ ati@@ ated for example - the question arises : what does this actually have to do with safety and terror ?
yes , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère says it is important to differenti@@ ate between the topics of refugees and terror .
but it cannot be said in dis@@ agreements that the attacks were refugees from Ans@@ bach and Würzburg .
in addition , many people accounted for security in view of the high number of refugees .
and things that deeply de@@ pressed people , were now unable to cling to const@@ itu@@ res times .
the inner security is enormous in the focus .
only the attacks in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the assurance is great .
and yes , there are const@@ itu@@ encies .
the Union and the SPD are therefore becoming increasingly in position on the subject of internal security .
in the past days , the two parties went high .
only a gar@@ th@@ ous dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police , then on a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons of Interior , in which R@@ ess@@ ort@@ ch@@ efs also demand a Bur@@ ka ban and a revers@@ al of double citizenship .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère takes care of con@@ cili@@ atory tones here .
there is nothing from a passage from a double pass .
we have satisfactory the discussion in Germany .
you re@@ comp@@ lies , don &apos;t make sense .
and in a Bur@@ ka prohibition he has const@@ itu@@ tionally related concerns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether his own package is un@@ constitutional on all corners and whether it is actually &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reasonable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is for the coalition partner , still has to show itself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is a lot of things to worry about dispute .
however , the SPD is currently trying to pro@@ filing itself on the subject of internal security .
&quot; &quot; &quot; party principal Sig@@ mar Gabriel sign@@ alizes only carefully of convers@@ ations and says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to enhance safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Volkswagen gli@@ can still arrive .
despite Diesel sk@@ and@@ als the deliveries are rising worldwide .
but it does not work in all markets .
there is no concept for the call to call .
Volkswagen will start with deliveries in the second half of the year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe &apos;s largest motor@@ home can further demonstrate a plus in the previous year despite its many brands and a few well @-@ run markets . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , in July , the core brand VW weak@@ ened mainly in Western Europe and loaded the overall sales as the company announced in the D@@ ax .
the VW brand sold 1.8 percent less vehicles worldwide in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars than in the previous year .
sales in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s month .
in the home market of Germany , deliveries around almost a hex@@ ag@@ el off .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; managing director Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann led the weaker figures from July , mainly to two sales days less in Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , in some core markets , economic conditions have given &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed economic conditions &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote decided to withdrawal from the EU and explained a spokesperson .
in the U.S. , where the exhaust aff@@ aires first performed , there is also a minus of be@@ ech .
large support for VW is the Chinese market .
all in all , the mainly affected house brand of Lower Saxony is further gli@@ ster@@ ing due to the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months only an extra@@ dition minus of 0.9 percent amounted to 3,@@ 37 million vehicles .
net sales of Fred Kap@@ pler could lead to a sales spl@@ end@@ us from January to July .
1.3 percent more vehicles supplied Volkswagen at this time , 5.@@ 904 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had manipul@@ ated a software exhaust .
in Germany alone , VW calls around 2.5 million cars to upgrade into the workshops .
in the course of re@@ arm@@ ament , VW confirms that the conversion of cars had no negative effects .
after retro@@ fitting the vehicles , there is no deteri@@ oration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor power .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the coach charge the customer after the upgrade a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guaranteed cleaning &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but do not speak of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as it was called on Friday in business trips . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reason be legal aspects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had reported that Volkswagen will give its German customers a guarantee of rounded diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was confirmed on the last Monday VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport .
the Ministry of Transport was confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has completed the editions of my inquiry commission and the KBA fully . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; devi@@ ations from it will not be accepted , &quot; said Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry .
VW has taken the guarantee that for fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance , after retro@@ fitting , have no deteri@@ or@@ ations and all typ@@ ing relevant vehicle values remain unchanged .
Volkswagen itself does not use the term &quot; guarantee , &quot; but not as to travel in business trips .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the wide term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warranty &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers come for example a half year after the upgrade , with a motor @-@ damage to a workshop - and this could affect the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even in customer interest , it is important to avoid that it is in case of any other damages that have nothing to do with the exhaust sc@@ andal , such as it was called .
therefore , VW is not using the term &quot; guarantee . &quot;
the Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ enb@@ ank G@@ mund at T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see will demand pen@@ alties in the future as the second Institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; banking Director Josef Paul said on Thursday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It &apos;s only about 139 customers to park the € 40 million on Gi@@ ro@@ - or daily monetary policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Federal Ministry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German banks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speaks of an individual and does not see a signal : normal as@@ par@@ agus would not fear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to pay for their austerity pen@@ alties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
store banks money over night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay their 0.4 per cent pen@@ alties .
this fee demands the Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ enb@@ ank G@@ mund from September of private and corporate clients for deposits of more than 100,000 euros on gi@@ ro@@ - or daily monetary accounts .
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 costs will be 400 Euro in the year , &quot; said Paul .
he has risen to 40 million euros for some time , which could be with@@ drawn from one day to another , and he could not be able to understand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the central bank account and create 0.4 per cent of costs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ban@@ quet . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t lay down for every one million euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the caus@@ al principle , the cost is now further .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is easy to leave cash in the v@@ aults of Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ enb@@ ank , it would be much too dangerous : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen four dec@@ lines , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the Chief Financial Officer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
most clients had understanding and changed to other requirements .
only few immigrants from other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bayern association declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy caused significant costs in all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it alone is not possible to wear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; economic @-@ economically fe@@ as@@ ible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks have therefore increased their charges for account management , credit cards or transfers .
for deposits of three million euros , the Thur@@ ing@@ ian folk and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ enb@@ ank Al@@ ten@@ burger Country made head@@ lines in 2014 with its sk@@ at@@ bench office in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , CEO of the banking association , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t expect private clients to pay for deposits to pay for deposits , the competition in Germany is much too strong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a ban@@ ker said on the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; a cliff which is a bit l@@ ush from fortune . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can become a small bank for a problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they make free money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Gen@@ co@@ operative bank G@@ mund has branch offices in Bad Wies@@ see , R@@ ott@@ ach @-@ E@@ ggers , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .
in the region , renowned actors , sport@@ s@@ men and entrepren@@ eurs live .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bayern association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bayern &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are currently no further banks that charge a storage set for deposits of private customers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said spokesperson Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the President of the Federal Association of German folk banks and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ enb@@ anken ( BvR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had declared the end of June : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the threshold to go to neg@@ atives &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is very , very high . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
competition is hard , and it threat@@ ens to emig@@ rate to competition .

&quot; &quot; &quot; if this blog would be a news report on TV , I would like to follow the camera , whilst in a busy street in S@@ oh@@ o run , a modest grey suit and wild gest@@ uli@@ ers before I keep to stop my hands and need something to be such as : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so let &apos;s throw a closer look at it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so let &apos;s take a look at it .
even if the heart takes up slowly at his charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where once @-@ independent sellers were located - there are still a hand@@ ful of fantastic record stores .
I would probably ask the c@@ amer@@ aman , to switch the camera for the next part , where I get in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind by observation .
Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , whom I say by Sister Ray ( data number : two young women , three men middle age ) into Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( data number : eight males intermediate age , a woman , probably around the 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours .
is he a collector , I wonder ?
&quot; I guess it , &quot; he says .
I have about 3.000 or 4.000 plates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these records , pictured above ( he sent me the snap@@ shot by e @-@ mail , I &apos;m not following him ) , dress the walls of his living room . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles , is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records that he could not afford to buy stuff when he was recently sold , when he was young and broke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many things I buy , are out of the late 60s , early 70s , who was released when I was 11 or 12 . things that I was probably too young to buy them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he agre@@ es to those who are buying records , rather intro@@ ver@@ ted , and would like to spend time alone , and adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink much . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is my disaster .
NEX@@ T , 25 who works at Sister Ray also believes that many customers that he meets to the You@@ go@@ v profile .
he has also noticed a new wave of people who have influenced by the media , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and get to buy their old records .
of the convers@@ ations I have led , people are usually so around 1998 or 1999 of their collection .
customers who once sold their records to buy CDs , now sell their CDs to buy their CDs again , &quot; he says .
that would explain the boom of tra@@ ilers of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates ?
it takes only a few seconds in a shop like Phon@@ ica to recognize that record stores a so@@ othing community of equality .
according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers participated in the cont@@ act@@ less payment system .
some record fans feel overcome by the digital world and would like to retreat into the stability of familiar sound plate , of objects , the happy ju@@ gen@@ ders .
&quot; I think sometimes it can be the col@@ t of a void or possession of material poss@@ essions as a kind of comfort , &quot; says GMT .
this is with me as collectors and I think it is so many people .
it is a simple way to deal mentally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social worker ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a staff from a flat stack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey conducted by IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of people who have purchased a record last month they have not listened .
the survey also found that 41 % had a turn@@ table that they never use , while 7 % for those who buy one record , do not have any turn@@ tables .
at this time of the news report I would probably look very worried , while I leaf@@ lets to the Bos@@ sa Nova comp@@ il@@ ations .
J@@ onny , 42 , who works at sounds of the Universe ( data number : three men middle age ) has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy &quot; of the Revi@@ val .
&quot; someone just came here recently and said , &quot; I sit no turn@@ table , but I would like to buy a radio record that I can put it into the shelf , &quot; he says .
this is not a large percentage , but it is definitely going to happen .
more productive , less music .
we have people who say : &quot; I have no turn@@ table . &quot;
these are younger people , not older , who only come slowly .
opp , which has almost a whole floor dedicated to the records , has an underground audience than I go .
there are couples around 70 , tourists who make photos , teen@@ agers and women middle ages .
even though the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops , Wild Be@@ asts &apos;s latest syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and sex@@ be@@ pack@@ ers pop from the loud@@ speakers - is it good to see such diversity among customers .
none of them looks very lonely , but nag@@ ging psych@@ ic trau@@ mat@@ a are hard to det@@ ectable , when one stands next to somebody for 30 seconds .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around since a couple of minutes and look at the variety of plates available for sale .
it rather makes a window boom as a big purchase .
it doesn &apos;t des@@ erved a lot , therefore , collecting records no real option , says it .
it costs much .
it &apos;s easy to listen to music from a computer or in another way , but the beauty of records is ... &quot; it drives with a loved sigh@@ te@@ zer .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business , which is said to have inspired by a new generation of record lovers : urban out@@ fit@@ ters .
while I give the appearance of the je@@ ans hot@@ spots , I observe a group of young teenage girls who groups to group a moment around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before making a father and his daughter to buy a Cro@@ sley record player .
on the left is a stair@@ case , a wall full plates of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , Amy Win@@ eh@@ ouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential records for an average collection .
nobody looks at it - perhaps because they are only pure decorative , some as far above that it is impossible to touch them .
it is pure &quot; record art . &quot;
but considering that any attraction for these items mean more money for the industry , and some customers in the depths of So@@ hos could be sent for more , there is nothing to complain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others , even the one that is most important for luxury objects such as records . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even if my research shows that the results of You@@ Go@@ v vote , they leave , at least in record shops in S@@ oh@@ o , the great number of female collectors and record lovers that exist in reality , record shops and On@@ line@@ for@@ en .
these people are probably working hard at school or in offices .
they spend their Thursday morning with security not with the stro@@ ll@@ ing through turn@@ tables of Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves by plates , while star@@ ving the face of an un@@ c@@ anny , 30 @-@ year @-@ old false present@@ er who stands out over the shoulders no crazy men aged over the shoulders .

French Court re@@ jects offer on demol@@ ition of business in the jungle refugee camp
a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , where thousands of refugees live .
in case of a trial , the authorities in Cal@@ ais argue that the state should be able to settle its 72 temporary businesses in other goods , from cigarettes to Energ@@ y@@ drinks , sell , hair@@ dressing services or tea for 50 cents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants .
the Cal@@ ais pre@@ fecture has argu@@ ed that these places should be torn down because they would be a parallel economy , which would not be paid to taxes and the risk of fire and risk of fire .
humanitarian groups distributed to the court that the shops and restaurants are important , as the free meals that are offered by the state @-@ backed association and other groups is not enough foods for growing numbers in the camp .
they also led out that the provisional shops and restaurants often have accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the dism@@ iss@@ al of people who operate 72 pro@@ vision@@ ally businesses , but cleared one that the concerns of the pre@@ fecture of Cal@@ ais &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are absolutely comprehen@@ sible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that food stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role as only people live , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; live in extreme prec@@ ari@@ ous conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said that the areas will offer peaceful meeting points between refugees and volunteers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the places that was threatened by the precip@@ itation was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café des Camp , a non @-@ profit and French cuisine , as well as a consultation on asylum seek@@ ers for hundreds of vulner@@ able un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 170@@ .000 people have signed pet@@ ition to preserve the Kids &apos; Café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it was that the closure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these children would be a catastrophe , of whom the youngest is eight years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

here comes the En@@ forcement trailer
Germany &apos;s shave must focus on the next generation of speed@@ ometer : in various federal states , among others in H@@ esse and Brandenburg , new flash devices are tested , which should bring Tem@@ pos@@ ers especially effectively .
the futur@@ istic @-@ acting En@@ forcement trailer of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden , for example , can be used at accidents , where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement .
for example , on highway building blocks or to rehabil@@ itated bridges , there are often no necessary infrastructure to ensure compliance with a stationary se@@ ater for compliance with the speed limit .
a durable mobile structure can be too dangerous or costly .
the En@@ forcement trailer is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts five days with un@@ interrupted measuring operation five days , the case data will be encrypted via a modem .
with laser measuring technology , all vehicles can also be recorded at the same time .
variable speed limit as well as access upgrade to time , vehicle strips and vehicle class can also be monitored .
in the highly dangerous state , one can move the trailer with each car with trailer hit@@ ch .
so that he is not simply cl@@ ut@@ ured , it is lowered in measuring mode , so that the wheels in the ar@@ mo@@ red and by the way also dis@@ mantle the outer hull .
additionally , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the bl@@ itzer from v@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer is tested according to Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and is now also used .
foreign Auth@@ orities also te@@ ats with the new technology : recently , France has re@@ ordered 100 pieces , following an order of 150 pieces last year .
great Britain covers silver in 7 @-@ year ru@@ g@@ by , after Fiji Master@@ class Gold wins
the impressive performance of Great Britain in the 7 @-@ year ru@@ g@@ by came to a ab@@ rupt stop at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were defeated by 43 @-@ 7 at the De@@ od@@ oro Stadium here in Rio .
Fiji divided a master class in handling , Side @-@ Step@@ ping , After@@ wards , Line and raw power to win gold - its first Olympic medal in each color .
the defeat was missed by the not too bad tro@@ phy of the silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth one in that day - and they were able to be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they struck New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the clear defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ final on the same day could fall to them in the final .
but ir@@ respective of this , Fiji had been defeated a 15 @-@ man team in top form .
it might be a consol@@ ation for GB - but it will probably not - that at least one Br@@ it tomorrow will have a gold medal around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is head coach Ben Ryan , the former head for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don .
GB had a difficult path behind him .
eight years ago , they have lost every game with Ryan Sev@@ ens .
here they just lost one .
this cap will hurt , but progress is amazing .
Fiji began to be wonderful and did the attacks of GB@@ s of fun off .
it felt for the captain Tom Mitchell to and Co . at , when one would walk in driving buses . the World Series winner went upwards from 5 @-@ 0 to the top , as the O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au moved in the corner .
with another four minutes of playing , Jerry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right corner that he walked .
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly took the ball .
an he@@ ge@@ aring T@@ in of Mitchell stopped the mountain of Man Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa a third goal , but Fiji had just stopped .
in the seventh minute J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a l@@ ete a touch down in the right corner and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since the re @-@ release and there was still a minute time playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pre@@ f@@ ake through further weak Tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB teams and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate .
the conversion had a 29 @-@ 0 to the break .
it is as if Fiji had been born to play the 7 , while the GB are still pract@@ ised .
this is how it is .
GB introduced basic changes to half @-@ time by and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for all four minutes , which was good for the rati@@ os of the first half , until Joshua passed through a brilliant inter@@ play of Fiji by Joshua .
Dan N@@ ort@@ on started an attempt for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game went long in favor of the south of SWA , whose fans sang , flags pushed and danced on the tri@@ b@@ une .
it was not hard to admire the playful approach of Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the i bag with another try in the last seconds .
the P@@ fi@@ ff sounds , the Fi@@ j@@ is embra@@ ced itself and exter@@ min@@ ate in the grass .
earlier on the day , Fiji had defeated Japan in the semi@@ finals with 20 @-@ 5 and Britain pressed South Africa in a s@@ nap half @-@ fin@@ al@@ match from the race - Great Britain &apos;s transformation of difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the bo@@ ks in the first half to the front , but Dan N@@ ort@@ on crossed the line with an impressive door@@ step and scored a gate under the post in the second half .
a brilliant , late Tac@@ kling of Marcus Watson , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ seaside team secured the win - and thus the silver medal .
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by fighting with the cancer of the train@@ ers to a rowing victory
there will be no engine of Re@@ yn@@ old Gold than with these games and that wants what hot .
from the first stro@@ kes to the last , 220 hard H@@ ie@@ ve , who meet in history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning had an additional meaning in their golden moment at Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even if there were only the Bei@@ ters who sat at the Ru@@ der , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the train@@ ers Robin Williams was present when she was in a row with no tax lady in a row , the first women in the history of British sport , who used such a scale .
her dom@@ ination was absolute , after all her 3@@ 9,@@ ter hand@@ ler , which also is un@@ parall@@ eled .
what we see are two brilliant athl@@ ets that gli@@ de over the surface with the elegance of sil@@ es , which is not reflected in the nature of the Tri@@ umph@@ al Arch .
behind each gold in the rowing there is a batt@@ ali@@ on to content hel@@ pers that make the difference and it was no more convenient than the trainer , who would not survive this day , as if he was diagnosed with cancer .
as he said he ris@@ ky .
I had ster@@ o@@ rec@@ tal cancer , which is oper@@ able and did they do .
if you don &apos;t do it , it spreads out everywhere .
it would have been quite a bad situation .
it changes a little the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio were lucky that he could start the beginning of 2014 , outside the season , in case the break was on a minimum , if such circumstances is the correct term .
I needed money , so I had to go better again soon .
it was an inc@@ en@@ tive .
I was in the hospital and ran on the station around - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough .
this is how it begins .
the rowing on itself is a challenge , but that makes it even greater .
in the in@@ medi@@ o@@ ability of victory , their first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a ner@@ ven@@ ing morning to talk more than usual , trying to process his own fears .
&quot; &quot; &quot; st@@ anning that was the cent@@ ur@@ ion at the Royal Art@@ illery regim@@ ent in a deployment in Afghanistan , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was this week an emotional wreck . that is perhaps something extreme , but it means so much . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is only repe@@ ating how much I mean , how much I and Helen and Robin worked with Robin .
it was three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
without Robin we would be no one , therefore a massive thank you to him . he is the best trainer in the world .
I could not wish for a better person or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning lost no race in the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm , with which their opponents could not keep up .
even in the last 500 metres , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark had to start up , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had a lot in reserve .
we were caught very at the moment .
Helen called &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it &apos;s really important to let not get involved .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not looking forward to doing something .
we wanted no fireworks today , we just wanted to achieve a good result , going out and win the race , what we did .
the couple will take for one year before making decisions about his future .
bell has to appear next week on a wedding , their own with the TV @-@ advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall .
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that this was my last race .
that would have too much pressure .
in London it took about six months to realize that I am an Olympic Champion .
it was all so new to me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
that feels so much better , &quot; she said .
31 years of exemplary clarity :
the managing director of the &quot; V@@ eit@@ enst@@ entry group , &quot; R@@ upper@@ t G@@ öller , retired .
the association is regarded as &quot; Bavarian . &quot;
a small fur@@ ther@@ ing pot@@ able water @-@ purpose association as a model for the large water producers .
as a result , some time ago it was at the origin@@ ary in a contribution of the Bavarian Radio .
a little later the water@@ forum of the government of Lower Fran@@ ken granted the two @-@ ties association .
the work of the V@@ eit@@ enst@@ ein@@ gruppe &quot; Bavarian as exemplary &quot; was exemplary .
behind all this Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who was 31 years in the special academic co @-@ association , was 28 years as Managing Director .
now he was retired at the age of 65 .
the drinking water sports association of the V@@ eit@@ enst@@ one group based in K@@ ott@@ endorf , municipality Breit@@ brun@@ n , promotes about 15@@ 0000 cubic meters of water and supplies 32 places and ham@@ let with about 5@@ 500 inhabitants .
affili@@ ates are the churches of Kirch@@ lou@@ der , Breit@@ brun@@ n , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the City of B@@ aun@@ ach .
for further cities and mun@@ icipalities there are water supply contracts .
the current chairman , Breit@@ brun@@ ns mayor in Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( FW ) , re@@ minded that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was appointed as a water keeper since 1988 and was nominated as a general manager of the purpose of the purpose in 1988 .
&quot; his duties have been very diverse and they are stretched from water management and maintenance activities , the bud@@ get@@ ary planning , calculation of charges and contributions to emergency revenues in weekends , &quot; said the chair@@ person .
as a prominent events she called up the commissioning and inauguration of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , property purchases in the new foun@@ tains ( 1998 ) and compensation of the new foun@@ tains ( 1999 ) , refurb@@ ishment of a central computer control system ( 2004 ) , and the new acquisition of a central computer control system ( 2004 ) .
there was no n@@ ursing staff and you &apos;ve always received new improvements because Water is covered and drinking water the most important food .
in her Lau@@ d@@ atio , she sang G@@ öl@@ lers loyal , reliable and correct service over 31 years .
he has employed a lot of heart bl@@ ank@@ ers for his water @-@ purpose and he has lived in the water @-@ purpose association as if it would be his own company .
a few weeks ago , he tried to present a true pract@@ iti@@ oner of the success of the V@@ eit@@ enst@@ entry group to nit@@ rate conflict in front of the water forum of the Unter@@ fran@@ ken district .
for this he received a lot of recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öller praised his part lob@@ ber Al@@ f@@ ons sem@@ bel who worked together with him for 28 years .
he is the best water@@ keeper and he was a loyal kno@@ b .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as a highlight in his point of view he described the Brun@@ nen@@ enbau e.@@ The re@@ organisation of the purpose @-@ association .
the biggest challenge and the most difficult use , however , were the sl@@ ump on the high container with Kirch@@ lou@@ der on January 3rd .
at minus 17 degrees the whole night had to work , so that the villages could be supplied with water .
also the supply of Neu@@ brun@@ n can be maintained once more , because the high tank of P@@ ett@@ ingen filled with hoses .
the management of the drinking water sports association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter who will follow the succession of Ru@@ pert G@@ öller .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the medicine made great progress , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the 44 year old of the Italian newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cor@@ riere della Ser@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man had shot in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ te@@ hei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on Friday 10.@@ 45 , and they were injured in a multi @-@ family house .
&quot; the man himself was inv@@ oked and stated to have killed his partner , &quot; said a police pre@@ acher .
the perpet@@ rator be on the run , and after him will be openly denied .
meanwhile , Sven S. might be travelling by car .
the man is about 1.@@ 80 m tall , muscular , brown burned and has a gl@@ at@@ ze .

however , it is a few years old .
meanwhile the man we@@ ars a gl@@ az@@ ze .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still bear the weapon with him , so the police .
if you see Sven S. , let the 110 call .
the police speaks of a &quot; relationship . &quot;
the victim was born in 1988 , the perpet@@ rator in 1981 .
the competent police in Lübeck initially wanted to do any information on the T@@ ather@@ gang or the relationship between perpet@@ rators and victims , but confirmed that a man was killed .
&quot; it is a killing deli@@ kt . &quot;
&quot; we are not saying any more at the moment , &quot; said a police pre@@ acher in Lübeck .
according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a special defence command ( SEK ) was held at the crime scene .
steel - view for German steel industry

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m really happy that we could finally achieve this tough negotiations after two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission initially planned to ask the steel producer , the gases coming from the blast furnace for electricity generation to ask for the cas@@ hier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the German industry industry , the steel industry threatened additional cost from 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel said to the WA@@ Z , I now give a basic agreement with the European Commission after talks with compet@@ iti@@ ation Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only if the generators are replaced in the steel works , an EEG revers@@ al of 20 percent .
but this will not be raised in the steel industry .
the IG Metall welcomed the unification of Germany with the EU Commission on self @-@ breaking production .
so the status quo of the previous regulation will largely be announced .
special significance have the successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; steel ist future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is that a first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; more need to follow . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite the reform of emission standards , climate and employment goals depend on climate and employment goals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated IG Metall @-@ Chef Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the financial crisis of 2008 the steel industry has been suffering under surplus capacities and a considerable price pressure .
last year , the position continued to intensi@@ fy the world &apos;s biggest producers in China given the weak@@ ly increasing demand of massive steel on the world market .
European manufacturers t@@ oss Chinese steel companies prize d@@ umping .
during this spring , the situation has somewhat relaxed .
for one of the mer@@ cen@@ ary tari@@ ffs on import ste@@ els , the economic prospects for China have sur@@ rendered to China .
it is un@@ clear how sustainable the price recovery is .
the German industry pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp was very careful on Thursday .
at last the prices have more stag@@ n@@ ated .
the sector re@@ acts to the difficult situation with further costs .
but Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp didn &apos;t want to exclu@@ de closure of individual works .
at the end of 2015 , around 8@@ 6,000 people were employed in the German steel industry .
in July , German steel manufacturers remain c@@ auti@@ ous despite rising prices and increasing orders .
they produced 3.4 million tons a good six percent less cru@@ de steel than in the previous year &apos;s month as the steel association announced on Friday .
after a short increase in May , the produced quantity came back to the second month in a row .
since the beginning of the year , production grew by two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association expects an increasing demand in the coming months thanks to an improved order system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
community , mind , health : sing sen@@ iors good
the singing has accompanied Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp all her life : as young girl she was in the school choir , she reserved the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a Senior Citi@@ zen choir .
&quot; sing me - emotional and physically , &quot; she describes .
after a rehear@@ sal they feel balanced , cheerful and a total of living , she says .
by the way , she does something good in her health and mind .
because singing is a great hobby for sen@@ iors , says Erhard H@@ ackl@@ er from the German senior league .
most sen@@ iors sing in chor@@ us and sharing with equ@@ ations the joy of music , H@@ ackl@@ er describes .
by regular co@@ hes@@ ion , sen@@ iors may establish and maintain social contacts .
because often social and family structures in the age , a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this experience also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp &apos;s in her choir : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to speak and organize to the others and learn from each other - a chor@@ us is a very special form of combining together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
singing can be st@@ ress@@ ful in the positive sense , H@@ ackl@@ es means .
elderly are a deep and controlled breathing .
who calls his lungs regularly , is not so fast out of the pu@@ rest in everyday life .
even if it comes to preserve the sound of the voice in age , singing is an optimal hobby .
for older people , singing often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz , from the Federal Labour Community of sen@@ iors .
in the older generations , the common singing had a much higher priority , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and in leisure , she explains .
L@@ enz frequently observed that singing or listening of songs in elderly people have ar@@ ous@@ ed many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth .
lyrics and especially melodies ex@@ hor@@ des themselves in the dise@@ ased events of long @-@ lying events .
when singing , a special performance is required when singing , L@@ enz explains .
at the same time , focus on his own voice and on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers , this is a great cognitive challenge .
just older people who live alone , practice this way , not only to concentrate on yourself .
another positive aspect is the recognition that one drives through the singing in chor@@ us , H@@ ackl@@ er thinks .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
even the self @-@ este@@ em is growing by singing in a chor@@ us .
to show yourself : if I have long for something , I &apos;ll get better and watch over me - this experience strength@@ ens .
good reasons to start singing with singing , so there is enough .
who wants to try a new hobby , should not hesitate - even if he means a little talent , L@@ enz shows .
you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 sin@@ ful people , who &apos;s already listening to it when a sound is next to it ?
in search of a suitable offer , Sen@@ iors say different ways , H@@ ackl@@ es says .
if someone sings among the memory in an old bos@@ om , you can easily join .
many cities also offer views of the cho@@ irs in the surroundings .
those who want to sing in a church choir can direct itself directly to the church or the church .
many senior cho@@ irs can also be found on the Internet .
anyone who has no access to the Internet , ask the family , friends or neighbours for help with the Internet .
who wants to sing , should definitely join a chor@@ us , H@@ ackl@@ es advis@@ es .
sing the soul well and has something effective - this is true for every age .
cats react sensiti@@ bler as tom@@ cat on scre@@ ams of the young animals
biolog@@ ists studied in Hanover , what effect the calls of cats have grown on adult animals .
to their surprise the male also didn &apos;t leave the male cold - but they always thought in contrast to the female .
female cats may recognize the ar@@ ous@@ al level of cats on the Mi@@ th@@ aw of the little ones .
they react by ten percent faster on foli@@ age of k@@ ittens who choose themselves in great need as scientists from veter@@ inary Academy and the Hannover Medical School ( MH@@ H ) .
K@@ ater also react to the calls of k@@ ittens - but always the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; evi@@ dently , the acou@@ st@@ ical differences between the h@@ ops of less and heavily ar@@ ous@@ ed young are either not perc@@ ep@@ tible , or not of significance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Bi@@ olog@@ in Wie@@ b@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding from the MH@@ H . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first author of the study published on this Friday in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a previous examination , the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the k@@ ittens cry with the ur@@ gency of their assistance differs .
a total of nine adult cats and eight we@@ eds were observed in the MH@@ H animal hus@@ band@@ ry .
they were played for a call of little ones who were taken from the saus@@ age for three minutes and separated by mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
secon@@ dly , they were confron@@ ted with scre@@ aming of stronger er@@ ted k@@ ittens , which were raised in addition .
the researchers hold their results in spite of the low sample .
&quot; every female , even those who had no own offspring re@@ acted to the cry , &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding .
they turned out faster to the speaker , when this calls played the very reg@@ ained k@@ ittens .
this ability may possibly be born or could develop with the sexually mature .
&quot; a surprise was that the males have re@@ acted at all , &quot; said the Bi@@ ologist .
in the past , scientists have already studied the reactions of women and men on baby sounds .
even in doing so , some studies showed that women were sensitive to babies , whether they were already mothers or not , the Bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported .
Po@@ dol@@ ski attacks with &quot; gala &quot; to Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
the arrest warrant has been issued against the former soccer star Hak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ r .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
a major football match will be held in Turkey for the first time after the coup attempt .
before the Du@@ el of the Arch@@ rival Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ skis Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul around the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced .
already during the suspension of the takeover after the overthrow in July , the government , the daily life of norm@@ ality should not be affected .
however , this does not apply to those suspected of suspected of belonging to the Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len movement , who is responsible for the coup attempt .
but it is not well done prior to football .
the Prosec@@ ution filed an arrest warrant against the former k@@ icker Hak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ r .
according to that , Sü@@ k@@ r is accused of being accused of being a terrorist group .
Sü@@ k@@ r is intended to be followers of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan .
although the exception is valid for 90 days , in fact , this has actually happened to the life of most Turks , as well as no effects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the no@@ c@@ tur@@ nal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy guards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in public places throughout the country has declared Erdogan on Wednesday to end . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - split in p@@ endants and opponents of the Earth .
especially fans of the workers club Bes@@ ik@@ tas are not among the friends of the President .
but what is the Gro@@ s of Turks about dramatic experiences in history , is the strict re@@ jection of military put@@ ties .
even the fans themselves agree - no matter whether their hearts beat for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
at Pok@@ al@@ si@@ eger &quot; gala &quot; there will be more to Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski again .
the Cologne industry set its sporty value as proof : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first time as a Top@@ sc@@ orer of his club .
in the final game against fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce , he scored the 1 : 0 victory .
the paper &quot; Fan@@ atics &quot; prevailed against him : &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot;
he finished the season in an outstanding way and secured his team the tro@@ phy .
thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; the disappoin@@ ting season for the record master took a irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able conclusion .
after the pre @-@ round K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; Lion &quot; will soon come out early in the Europe League .
it was only six to rank six in the Sü@@ per Li@@ g .
the season was not good .
Pok@@ al was the only way to win something .
&quot; we managed that and that is the most important thing , &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ sky .
the game year was better for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
especially thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who started with 26 seasonal buff@@ ers as Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ ch the basis for the 14th title .
this is also the reason that the fans hope to return the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
in fact , when AC Florence was signed among the contract and transferred to Bes@@ ik@@ tas , after the coup attempt , not to return for the political situation in the country after his EM @-@ vacation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he must only say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ icker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; club chief F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the stri@@ ker would have to be willing to aband@@ on approximately one third of its € 7.5 million estimated annual sal@@ aries , Or@@ man stated : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; its salary in Florence can &apos;t pay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite d@@ oping : these athletes still have medals in Olympic Games in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Justin Gat@@ lin had been locked up twice for d@@ oping ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ owa may not start in Rio .
others over@@ led athle@@ tics sin@@ ner can only laugh - they fight in Rio by medals .
the topic D@@ oping definitely defines the head@@ lines at the Rio Olympics .
the Russian s@@ wimm@@ ers of Juli@@ ja Jef@@ im@@ owa , who compl@@ ained after a d@@ oping @-@ lock , was pun@@ ish@@ able shortly before the play , with her start ( 100 m chest ) mer@@ cil@@ ess and hat@@ u@@ ed .
it was a sc@@ ur@@ r@@ ile scene : with a laid smile she was still in the hall and prov@@ oked with her appearance .
as determined , they won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke out in a j@@ ub@@ el@@ storm .
but there are numerous other athletes competing in the Rio Olympics in spite of d@@ oping past .
here is an overview :
Justin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old belongs to the controversial figures in athle@@ tics .
he had been closed two times because of d@@ oping ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
since his spell the Olympic champion of 2004 and ex @-@ world champion runs even faster than before , he is number one in the world over 100 m and is considered the biggest challenge of Us@@ ain Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ season / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ time Olympic Champion and seven times world champion in 2010 had to sit down a six months lock , after having been detected the intake of pain by Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don .
after surgery she had strong pain after surgery , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended .
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( disc@@ us / Croatia ) : 2011 , the Olympic Champion of 2012 , world championships of 2013 and European Championships from 2010 to 2016 was positively tested on the forbidden stimul@@ ant drugs meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amine .
Per@@ kovic denied the sent@@ encing and was blocked for six months .
the four fur@@ th@@ est th@@ rows this year go to the account of the great gold favour@@ ites .
La@@ Shawn Mer@@ rit ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 m / USA ) : the Beijing Olympics and two time world champion over 400 m , was tested positive in 2010 and has been tested for 21 months .
a means to penis enlargement has been responsible , expensive Mer@@ ritt .
this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is the fastest man in the world over 200 and 400 m .
Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( ham@@ let &apos;s throw , Belarus ) : probably hardly any athl@@ ets have been recognized so many medals .
thus , T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title nine years later , after which testosterone d@@ oping was established .
the meanwhile 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to em@@ it Olympic silver in 2004 because of ster@@ oid op@@ pression and the EM @-@ title in 2006 because of testosterone abuse .
he also accepted the 2008 Olympic Games of the 2008 Olympic Games , due to an judgement of the International Criminal Tribunal .
with 8@@ 0,@@ 04 m he is ranked two of the ranking .
Liu Hong ( 20 km walk , China ) : the world record and gold favour@@ ites was only tested positive in May but may still be started in Rio .
the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world championships were found on the intake of a forbidden food supplement using the lock of the world anti @-@ d@@ oping agency WA@@ DA fell mild and ran already on July 13 .
Bom@@ b@@ enter@@ ror in Thailand - Austrian viol@@ ates - Sever@@ al dead
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand rises with the woman in contact , said the spokes@@ man for Foreign Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Fre@@ it@@ ag@@ early .
they suffered bar@@ ges and had been treated in the hospital , but have already left it again .
she planned her hom@@ ebo@@ und journey at the beginning of September .
whether the other explo@@ sions on the holiday island Ph@@ u@@ ket , as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ omp@@ on are also affected Austrian citizens , is still un@@ clear .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is standing in constant contact with local authorities , so pac@@ if@@ ice .
in the approximately 200 kilometres south of the capital of Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in initially ran out on Thursday evening in a Nightlife two bombs .
according to police , the police were killed , and some 20 people were injured , among them the Austrian , three German , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans .
Fre@@ it@@ ag@@ soon then again two jumps were high , so according to the authorities , another man was killed .
Ph@@ u@@ ket was also reported in the early morning .
the det@@ onation near tourists for the popular Ba@@ dest@@ al Pat@@ ong was injured as a taxi driver .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ east coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded , killing a municipal staff .
according to the authorities , the bomb planted in a flower bed in front of the prec@@ in@@ ct of coastal police in the air .
finally , det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g were calling on the south @-@ west coast as well as in Ch@@ omp@@ on on the Southeast Coast several injured .
you go from a link to the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , called it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bomb attack carry the same manuscript , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said armies General Dan@@ ai crit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Fre@@ it@@ ag@@ early before journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we expect it to be a coordinated attack . &quot;
it was too early to express yourself to possible mot@@ if@@ s - probably it is for the deeds of Muslim rebels .
Thai media also wanted to identify a pattern in the attacks , typical for the bombing of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
however , the Thai Police stated that the attacks were not related to the Islam@@ ist uprising movement , or with international terrorism .
&quot; this is only local sab@@ otage , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok .
rather , it dis@@ regard that bombs have been killed by enemies of the ruling military jun@@ ta .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the authorities would have received secret notes on imp@@ ending attacks in the south of the country - but they don &apos;t have been informed about the exact date and the places . &quot; &quot; &quot;
still be un@@ clear , which group behind the attacks .
the police cleared all its officials in the whole country , ensuring security buildings and airports , railway stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and am@@ us@@ ement quarters .
in Thailand there are always smaller bomb attacks , but they mostly do not turn against tourists .
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace that has been used by King of Thailand &apos;s king B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j for years .
after reason of reason explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends its homepage to absolutely follow the instructions of Thai safety authorities .
high security risk ( level 3 ) approved for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ iw@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah Vi@@ be and its surroundings .
after disputes between security forces and Muslim popul@@ ations , non @-@ necessary trips are not recommended in these provinces .
higher security risk ( level 2 ) approved for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday were issued a few days following a controversial referendum on the constitution of the military jun@@ ta .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these cle@@ ars to the military large influence over the coming years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Jun@@ ta boss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Chan @-@ o @-@ cha said that bombs have been an attempt to en@@ force chaos while the country is moving towards stability , an improvement in economic situation and tourism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the military un@@ ta , which took power in 2014 after a phase of bloody up@@ heav@@ als , with@@ stands himself too good to have led the kingdom back to stability and order .
however , the military has not succeeded in getting a grip on the overthrow of Muslim rebels for years in the extreme south of the country .
more than 6@@ 500 people were killed in the conflict .
almost a year ago in Bangkok , a stop at a popular Hindu shr@@ ine had killed 20 people - most of them are foreign tourists .
it was the blu@@ est attack in the younger history of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the visor of the Federal Office for Constitutional Affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after several local offices , the const@@ itu@@ tion@@ ing con@@ serv@@ ation@@ ists have also been under observation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ident@@ ities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; movement for stocks to the freedom of freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Constitutional head Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate said the German press agency in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , migrants are diff@@ am@@ ated from Islamic faith or from the Middle East in extrem@@ ist way .
therefore we watch the movement as well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she turns against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; multic@@ ul@@ ult@@ i @-@ w@@ ahn &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; un@@ controll@@ able mass migration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; loss of their own identity through alien@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
constitutional prot@@ ectors in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thur@@ ing@@ ia - observe the &quot; ident@@ ities &quot; already .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ma@@ ate said , his authority were closely coordinated with the country &apos;s decision . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; groups such as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; try to take their target audience where it stands , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the constitutional head . &quot; &quot; &quot;
generally , extrem@@ ists try to address them with you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music .
the Islam@@ ists as well as legal sex@@ ist .
that is not an ad@@ ore advertisement for the own thing .
the propaganda should address the people emotional .
young people are pr@@ one in a special way .
this is dangerous .
at last , from several provinces , reports on &quot; ident@@ ities &quot; were given to AF@@ D @-@ politicians .
Ma@@ did said , I have no knowledge .
for the constitutional protection possible contacts of this type be relevant only from some point .
it depends on whether the respective party - in this case the AF@@ D - through certain persons , the extrem@@ ist , changes and is so extrem@@ ist .
thus , whether such persons are tax@@ ed to the party .
this is not recogni@@ z@@ able .
with a view to the clear increase of legitim@@ ate off@@ ences and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugee camps Ma@@ ate , he would not speak in this context nor of new right terrorism .
but we &apos;ve found it in recent years that there can be legal structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Fre@@ it@@ aler Group .
it may well be that further legal groups or small groups form the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee camps or attacks from other right @-@ wing mot@@ if@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , a German @-@ wide control of legal proceedings is not recogni@@ z@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the previous groups were created on the regional level or social networks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ma@@ ate worried that many attacks on the account of people who did not have occurred in the right scene before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is the wor@@ rying .
many of the susp@@ ect for asylum seek@@ ers are not known as crimin@@ als , politically motivated off@@ ences or supporters of the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so many individuals have committed crimes committed before with right @-@ wing extrem@@ ists , who were perhaps politically in@@ different , or for example , CDU , SPD or Lin@@ ke , who then radic@@ ally have radic@@ alized by right @-@ sex@@ ist stimulation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ its becomes an inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not always determine the Olymp@@ ians or world records the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this shows the cour@@ ageous appearance of RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ it at the Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro .
at the Aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly over@@ weigh@@ ted s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia was slow to see no more time in the TV pictures .
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut was selected .
in social networks , Hab@@ te became the viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old completed his prec@@ ursor in 48 seconds and finished the 5@@ 9th place of 59 star@@ ters .
it was rather his not just athle@@ tic figure , which attracted the attention of international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still particip@@ ates in the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ian received a special way from the international swimming pool .
this is distributed to make swimming in the represented countries known .
since in Et@@ th@@ op@@ ia most sport@@ s@@ men run , Hab@@ it wanted to make something different .
preparation is all : RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ it makes ready for the big race .
quickly the first nick@@ names made the round .
some media referred to him as &quot; RO@@ B@@ EL of W@@ al . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in accordance with a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; welfare &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the English tab@@ loid The Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made fun with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his time , he only defeated a minute and almost five seconds more than 100 metres of Freist@@ il , because there was no role .
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
Eric Mou@@ ss@@ am@@ ban@@ i hosted the course of media attention during the Olympic Games in Sydney .
unforgettable was the appearance of the bu@@ oy@@ ancy from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to compete in a pre @-@ run over 100 metres of Freist@@ il alone .
the Mou@@ ss@@ am@@ ban@@ i was fired back then .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned to swim for eight months before Olympic and had never completed a long distance before the competition .

accident - Bus slip in cr@@ um@@ m@@ um in dit@@ ch : eight injured
an accident of a travel agency with 43 sen@@ iors as passengers are killed on Thursday in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ ir@@ n ( District Aur@@ ich ) eight people .
two of the occup@@ ants suffered severe injuries , divided the police .
the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach had to devi@@ ate to the opposite direction , according to an opposite g@@ ush@@ button .
the bus came to the right from the street and sli@@ d into a tren@@ ch , like a speaker in the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the bus &apos;s position the people could not leave the bus self @-@ constantly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire brig@@ ade liberated the in@@ mates .
six life@@ cars and an ambul@@ ance came to the accident on the state road 2 .
the un@@ preced@@ ented trav@@ eller were brought back to the Kr@@ um@@ m@@ é@@ ral district of Pe@@ ws@@ um .
you should wait for a replacement bus from the travel company .
the investig@@ ators demanded the load driver and the potential witnesses to sign up in the police .
the fees per cubic metre from October 1 , 2016 for the field of san@@ itation system Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ fare € 3.@@ 44 instead of 2,@@ 10 euros ( previously 2,@@ 26 euros ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 Euro ( previously 2,@@ 18 euros ) .
the waste fee will rise again at the latest in Az@@ endorf , if appropriate improvements may need to be necessary .
after a very sleep@@ y calculation , the waste price in Az@@ endorf is then at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic metre .
as mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , it was noted during the approval of the budget by the coun@@ rat@@ ory and Kul@@ mb@@ ach that there will be shel@@ ters for this wast@@ e@@ water treatment .
the Kas@@ endorf Market is obliged to carry on the grounds as due to legal foundations .
as of October 1 , 2016 , citizens and commercial and industrial companies from Wel@@ fare , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ opp , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Z@@ ult@@ enberg will have to gras@@ p deeper into the pur@@ se .
the fee increases between 48 and 67 percent .
as Managing Director Herbert Schmidt was showing the committee , a new calculation of the fees for wast@@ e@@ water plants was necessary .
in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ - or under@@ covers from the previous calendar period are to be compens@@ ated .
Schmidt thus founded the gra@@ b@@ ating rate increases with all three wast@@ e@@ water plants to make relatively small facilities with a very low se@@ wage fall , between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year .
due to the small distribution of distribution , for example , expenses for the necessary repair of several thousand Euros would have a serious impact .
the wast@@ e@@ water in all three plants should be slightly dec@@ lining .
in the past period of the period , all three plants were not last fallen in a substantial scope due to their age of rehabilitation and repair applications .
the plant in Az@@ endorf was almost 30 years old , the plants for cat@@ fish , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Z@@ ult@@ enberg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and L@@ opp almost 20 years .
Schmidt noted that in the waste water system Az@@ endorf , the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to a damage .
at the p@@ umping station , which had to over@@ take nearly 20 years old conveyor systems from the ground to over 20 years , the first sep@@ tic pond had to be installed and an additional ventilation option has to be installed , in order to maintain the water legal requirements in the future .
Schmidt : &quot; for these extraordinary expenses , the continued support and maintenance costs , which are to be considered in the new calendar period . &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs , which at the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012 still significantly below the current level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; stone houses made clear that at low se@@ wage fall in the three plants , expenses for the operation and maintenance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was full . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thereby , Schmidt , the market community of great entertainment costs had been spar@@ ed to wast@@ e@@ water plants over the past 20 years .
the situation for the af@@ ore@@ mentioned facilities will continue to remain pre@@ ten@@ se after view of stone houses , especially if one could not extend the supply area of the se@@ wer@@ age @-@ purpose Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ acht@@ al to expand these facilities because it is a deficit .

Snap@@ chat &quot; An@@ ime &quot; Effect as Asian cartoon
Snap@@ chat says that this filter is anim@@ e inspired , but some ob@@ servers say that it is un@@ sensitive to races .
with its filter tool it allows Snap@@ chat about 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with ident@@ ities in such a way that borders the absur@@ dity .
you can transform yourself into an pine@@ apple , a dog or a piece that could be from a Roy Lich@@ ten@@ stein painting .
the filters are un@@ f@@ law@@ less , st@@ aging tools that generate more than 30 million improved be@@ fies per day .
all wron@@ g@@ itte arrive to the public .
Snap@@ chat filters have drawn criticism in the past , where they were accused of prop@@ agate the app Black@@ face för@@ dere or white skin as beauty ideal .
when it struck a filter this week , which gave them sl@@ itting , false teeth and ev@@ ap@@ tly che@@ eks , called it some critics a rac@@ ist caric@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; j@@ aun@@ dice . &quot;
they asked if this repeated contro@@ vers@@ y pointed to a bigger problem , that the company has diversity .
the news and indig@@ nation were widely used on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mother@@ board , a day after Snap@@ chat announced that it had disabled the feature .
the company offered an excuse : the filter was an homage to anim@@ e characters and not as caric@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ lying , ra@@ cial sm@@ all@@ us experienced , the filter re@@ minded of viol@@ ating c@@ lich@@ és .
others refused the anim@@ e comparison .
in an e @-@ mail , Grace Sav@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student , whose twe@@ et was spread far beyond the photos that the filter was &quot; vulner@@ able and m@@ ild@@ ly said . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was difficult to argue with the oppos@@ ing of a very contradic@@ tory Asian caric@@ ature and the filter effects . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the filter shows that the filter is not yel@@ low@@ ly protected , but that the yel@@ lowing of the yel@@ lowing is dra@@ ined .
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural stum@@ bling .
the American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration of integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all keep in hand .
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats big audience of young people - who are di@@ vers@@ ed in terms of race than their older nem@@ esis , could rather expect to expect sensitivity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats fil@@ tering is a picture that is ins@@ ulting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it is much more difficult for such things as it was earlier , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday Z@@ hu , who works as product manager and engineer for medium , decided to delete their Snap@@ chat account , others on to do the same .
in an essay for medium and in a telephone interview , she said they believe that r@@ ass@@ en@@ related contro@@ vers@@ y shows a lack of diversity in the adjustment practices in Snap@@ chat .
Z@@ hu critic@@ ized the big part white , only male leadership and ended their nozzle with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ ete@@ Snap@@ chat .
&quot; either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their staff , so that they can make such decisions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there , but not in positions where they are safe or good to say . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint , the Snap@@ chat did not answer un@@ answered .
the company publishes no numbers on diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private enterprise .
on Thursday he refused to discuss the cultural back@@ grounds of his staff , but according to a speaker , the company recently has a staff responsible for sub@@ merged population groups and on internal integration efforts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hu said that she will be shut up with their Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wonder if they need more users than us to say that this is not O.@@ K. . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
military control of ISIS intelligence service information , presents Committee of the Congress
military intelligence of the United States Central Command Pro@@ mis@@ ed Information , in order to draw an optimal image of war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria as it allows the actual states of place in a report on Thursday .
the Pre@@ liminary Report , created by a Task Force of rep@@ ubli@@ can Members , intelligence service commit@@ tees , reported on great dis@@ satisfaction with Central Command Secret Services , reported how to change their ass@@ ess@@ ments to the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , short Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ ampa , Florida , which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; News Online Information , which were typically suff@@ oc@@ ated by the high @-@ level Cent@@ Com Commander of terrorism , reported a positive image of the American efforts to act as the actual states on site and were consistent positive than analyses of other news services , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cited a newspaper article . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer , if bad analyses will be presented our political leaders , &quot; Ken Cal@@ vert , rep@@ ubli@@ can member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives .
the management errors in Cent@@ Com range up to the top point of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analysis of the American efforts in the formation of the Iraqi forces .
although there is no direct evidence that government peaks have given instructions to change the reports , it shows how analysts were exposed to pressure from their suburbs , an optimal picture of the men@@ ace of the Islamic State , also known as ISIS or IS@@ IL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 many central Command press releases , opinions and statements before the Congress were much more positive than it corresponds , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; presented the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Cent@@ Com has publicly known that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s were already begin in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , second largest city in Iraq remains under control of the Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after months of investigation , it is so clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , rep@@ ubli@@ can Congress made from Kansas , in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the middle of the year 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the tops of Central Command changed the recre@@ ational reports to play the danger by ISIS in Iraq .
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans called the Task Force to Life after them played that analysts were worried about manipulation of Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings while investigations continued .
in addition , further investigations of Cent@@ Com reports are underway by the General Manager of the Defense Department .
Democratic members of the news utility committee published their own findings on Thursday , co@@ inci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the rep@@ ubli@@ can Task Force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2014 and 2015 Cent@@ Com created an over@@ ly restricted process for creating renewable services ass@@ ess@@ ments to IS@@ IL and the Iraqi Security Council , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave the highest ranking demo@@ cra@@ t in the Com@@ mit@@ tee , member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , Adam B. Schiff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this process , &quot; Mr. Schiff , &quot; delayed the publication of subsequent reports , &quot; announced the mor@@ als under analysts and &quot; gave excessive space for different opinions . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Mr. Schiff and Democrats den@@ ounced no evidence on a intervention of the White House at Cent@@ Com analysts in regards to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; specific political opinion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
preliminary results of the investigations of the Congress were published on Tuesday through &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
last August , the New York Times was reported by the Pentagon @-@ General @-@ General of the Pentagon , which were taken after complaints from Cent@@ Com analysts .
Lt@@ . C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Evans , a press report of the Pentagon , was in an opinion that the Ministry of Defence would not comment reports of the Congress , while the investigations of the general inspec@@ tor were still underway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he also gave that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts sometimes have quite di@@ ver@@ sive opinions about interpretation of complex data , and that the news services and the Ministry of Defence have welcomed a controversial discussion of these important topics of national defence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the investigations have been beyond the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion that is now made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
however , the accus@@ ations of last year have rejected the question of cla@@ iming President Obama to rely on Central Command entry for military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
criticism of the secret information about the Islamic state remin@@ is@@ cent of the Islamic state of more than ten years ago , when a Cent@@ Com analy@@ st was pointing to the recommendations of many analysts as a small occup@@ ying force in Iraq and a little time imposed on the consequences of the invasion of 2003 .
Mr. Hoo@@ ver also played a key role in the insur@@ rection against the current reporting on the Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; last year , the team led by Mr. Hoo@@ ker according to the government &apos;s statements against the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; government filed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the Islamic State Re@@ fin@@ ery no significant impact on the financial situation of the terror group , since these temporary refin@@ eries had been put into operation to sell oil on the black market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this realization , however , was not published , reported the Times in September .
Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ aging Commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the legisl@@ ature due to his outstanding positive assessment of war conditions at a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin was retired in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel at Central Command .
the US win four @-@ fourth match in the field of women , show@@ down show@@ down with Great Britain .
one day after they shot three goals , during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American field ho@@ ck@@ ey@@ team of women in a match on Thursday around India that the Americans won with 3 @-@ 0 .
five gates in two games should actually represent a memorable effort , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said it could not remember that ever done .
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I don &apos;t belong to the people who keep their goals in mind .
however , they know : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic Con@@ tests and are even in their group with the Brit@@ ons on the first place , who remain un@@ defeated after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
great Britain and the United States will hit twice on Saturday in the last round of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ final , the game will decide which the two will reach the first and second place within their group of six teams .
the first place will take a bit longer from the path that will lead the other group .
as always the game may go out on Saturday , Americans have triggered a surprising host through their success story , four years after they landed in the last London games on the last of 12 squares .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a hockey team in hands ( their two older sisters played the sport at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became the national player of the USA , the youngest in the history of this team .
they missed the Olympics in 2008 because it was not able to qualify for the cad@@ res .
then came the year 2012 in which for her and her team went wrong .
in the following year Craig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , coach of the National Team and thus began to turn things better .
&quot; a change of culture , mental change and a physical shift , &quot; said B@@ am .
we did not have the job in London that we now have .
we &apos;ve got the ru@@ d@@ dle completely ro@@ aring .
on Thursday evening , B@@ am opened the Tor@@ rei@@ gen in the first half of the game with a back@@ sli@@ t from the Middle East .
India has gone without a victory in the game , but the team showed itself surprisingly tough and held the game stand from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter , until B@@ am took the game into their hands .
she completed a spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved to the middle and picked up the ball in the gate to get the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 lead .
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the tournament for the door@@ keepers of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who had to book a gateway in each of the previous games so far .
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in a good position &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will hin@@ ge away from the result of the next game on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
amid the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of Tramp@@ ol@@ ins
wherever you are , how late it is , the Olympic Games are .
the events of Rio de Janeiro feel constant and inevitable , a rapid relay between competition and pursu@@ it .
it is like the Olympic tor@@ ch even a burning rod , who is enough to protect the Turner to the tri@@ athletes .
you can not switch to the TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbors during the queu@@ e in the Coff@@ es@@ hop queu@@ e , without hearing about Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ cover@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is for the first time during the Olympic Games and a women &apos;s s@@ warm with dimples , could have been well received under these known names , which would be sent to Prime Time by sponsors and welfare @-@ TV advertising , if he would be a s@@ wimm@@ ers , Turner or even fe@@ eders .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fighting in the Olympic trampoline for gold .
the Olympic flame is not illumin@@ ating every event .
further from the centre , partly in the shade are the sports , which are not generally recognised : aerial shoot , ar@@ cher@@ y , bad@@ minton , ta@@ ek@@ w@@ ondo .
we will always have the breast swim and may reign for long .
but if I might make a modest arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , let me guide the attention on the dis@@ crete charm of the trampoline .
although the tr@@ amp had already been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it was in Sydney it was noticed that many of them that I had asked , did not know that it is even a Olympics .
that could also be regional ignor@@ ance .
although the USA sent athletes to the competition , there has never been a medal in the trampoline and had a athl@@ ete until 2012 , which has made it to the final round .
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadian who for women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ Lenn@@ on from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
jumping on the trampoline has a certain outer edge char@@ me , partly because it sounds for a C@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ schule for the Olympic Games .
at this point , I should admit that I am not an expert , but only a better enthusi@@ ast .
it has a hum@@ orous potential - the cart@@ o@@ on@@ ous trem@@ or of his never wanted up@@ lifting - but also the Gra@@ zie of gymn@@ ast@@ ness and diving , the two sports which essentially combines it .
the word &quot; trampoline &quot; comes from the Spanish El trampoline , which means so much means &quot; spring@@ board . &quot;
emerging vic@@ tors jump on a giant trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have a number of falling movements ( turning , he@@ els and sage ) before they land at the feet .
they will be evaluated according to the official Olympi@@ ap@@ ro@@ gram for execution , difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot;
eigh@@ ty athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete in Rio each other .
the most common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
med@@ alli@@ sts must continue in their quest for gold , faster , upward and upward , sometimes up to the target , sometimes go and back , up and down on the playground .
they do not only hunt the finish line or the cur@@ sor , but also in the TV broadcast a further polite goal : the world or the Olympics .
the targeted stri@@ ving is no@@ bel , ad@@ mira@@ ble , even fan@@ atic - and it &apos;s enough to even stir up a spect@@ ator .
but it &apos;s also what I feel like trying to watch out of these games as something .
this trampoline offers an attraction .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is located above .
the forward movement is not the goal .
he or she pr@@ un@@ ed , seem@@ ingly heavy like an ast@@ ron@@ aut , goes up , then down , then effort@@ lessly back upwards .
there is also a contest , of course not without difficulty , but while exercising there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no v@@ ault in the distance , only the dre@@ aming , elegant clearing of time and gravity .
it is so Zen as the competition in the Olympic Games can only be .
the qualifying and final customers will take place on Friday afternoon by 13.@@ 00 Eastern Time ; the male on Saturday , also at 13.@@ 00 .
N@@ BC will ex@@ ude the bottom hour as part of a afternoon block at 14.00 on two days .
in the midst of the Olympia @-@ Man@@ ie , they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is likely to over@@ see in general tum@@ ult .
when the consciousness of consciousness can only be achieved through the att@@ itudes and the object of male athletes , according to The Wall Street Journal revealed recently - Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey anticip@@ ates his flying , new fan base .
&quot; a generation of protest@@ ing &quot; in Ethiopia , Long a partnership in the USA
violent protest in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators , the political changes in Ethiopia are demanding to violent resistance of the government .
witnesses say that zig of Protest@@ ants were killed during clas@@ hes with the police .
is Ethiopia just going to collapse ?
in the past ten years it was one of the weal@@ thier countries in Africa , a solid association with a rapidly growing economy .
but in the last few months , protests against the government has shaken the country and widespread in more areas .
last week , thousands of people st@@ acked on roads and required fundamental political changes .
the government &apos;s response was un@@ merciful according to human rights organizations .
witnesses declared that polic@@ emen were shot and killed in un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
in circulation , videos on protests , probably from the last or early of this year , show how security leaders are showing young people with sticks , while they were forced to make a hand against a wall .
the head of the UN Committee on Human Rights now demands an incoming investigation .
&quot; it has always been difficult to hold this country , and in future , it will become even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group .
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country of Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
American military and secret services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians , to fight terrorist attacks on the region , especially in Somalia . only few countries in Africa , if at all , get so much western help .
Ethiop@@ ians economy expanded in considerable temp@@ o .
his infrastructure dra@@ stically improved - there is a new pend@@ ul@@ um in the capital Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba .
streets are usually quiet , safe and clean .
even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have constantly led the op@@ pression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted , dis@@ si@@ dents have been effective to silence .
many were sent to exile or prison , sent to the deser@@ ts of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you supp@@ ress people and they do not have any other options except to protest , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a teacher in the Ethiop@@ ian Ethiop@@ ian . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all youth protest@@ ed .
a generation of protest@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are numerous complaints that cover all from the ground up to worms in relation to power of ruling coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after an extensive election last year , the ruling party and its allies were given the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament .
at the same time , ten@@ sions rise along the border to Er@@ it@@ rea ; a struggle for this controversial , controversial line required in June hundreds of lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; analy@@ st fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts such as the O@@ ro@@ mo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden , which were more or less forced in recent years , would use the turbul@@ ence and arm themselves again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
several factors explain why feelings of provo@@ cation after years of abuse has now explo@@ de under the surface .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
only in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians were able to communicate with social media , since cheap smartphones were always more common and improved the Internet services .
even if the government has access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do in regular intervals , especially at protests , do many people still communicate more about Internet Pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they stop .
several young Ethiop@@ ians gave the fact that they were so close to protests .
the second factor is that there are more solidarity between the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ nic@@ ities in Ethiopia .
the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
since e@@ ye@@ es , Am@@ har@@ as , which come from Ä@@ th@@ op@@ iens are mainly Christian high@@ lands , in politics and business , while they explo@@ ited the O@@ ro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are living and in low@@ lands .
but this also changes .
&quot; we are to coordin@@ ate under a screen , &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of O@@ ro@@ mos .
the largest protests were held in areas of Am@@ har@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray , which accounts for around 6 percent of the population and dominant in military service , in trade and politics .
the third reason for the un@@ rest is death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was up to his death at a non @-@ public@@ ity illness in the year 2012 17 years of Ethiopia &apos;s prime minister .
he was considered a tac@@ tical gen@@ ius , a man who could think of corners .
analysts say that he was particularly dis@@ semin@@ ated in use early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and to use Sonder@@ Commission@@ ers to edit opponents and make them harmful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime is missing in this basic skill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ le@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen from relatively op@@ a@@ que reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es .
other than Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray Region North Ethiop@@ ians , is Lord H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am from the South .
analysts say that he enjoys not enjoying the confidence of the Tig@@ ray controlled safety services .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last time Ethiopia had such a u@@ pro@@ ar in 2005 , after thousands of elections protest@@ ed by the government seem@@ ingly , according to information from analy@@ tics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
during the following Raz@@ ants many Protest@@ ants were killed , even though it were less than in the last few months and this time of distur@@ ban@@ ces went relatively quickly .
development experts lob@@ ten Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their visionary infrastructure plan , like the new pend@@ ul@@ ler suit , as well as for its measur@@ able progress in poverty reduction .
but obviously this does not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal abuse of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and she takes a dangerous ethnic form .
last month , Protest@@ ers attacked in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ ic town , by Tig@@ ray , guided shops and hatred towards the Tig@@ ray is becoming increasingly exerc@@ ised in social media .
analysts say that protests in the U.S. and other Western allies occur in a pec@@ uli@@ ar position .
the U.S. government used Ethiopia as a base for D@@ ron@@ en@@ vi@@ on to neighbouring Somalia , even if they recently shared that it closed this base .
while the West wants to support democracy , he doesn &apos;t want his ally to collapse in an already vol@@ at@@ ile area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , Mr Ab@@ di said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin ti@@ gh@@ trop@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains his asser@@ tion Obama was &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m . &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump attempted to scatter the last contro@@ vers@@ y on Friday , defe@@ ating his campaign by repe@@ ating that his multi @-@ repeated asser@@ tion , President Obama and Hillary Clinton had been the &quot; Fo@@ under &quot; of the terror state of the Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this clari@@ fication threw new questions on the communication skills of the Presi@@ dential candidate of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , whether he is able to communicate clearly with the American public . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it also brings his fel@@ low@@ men who try to take care of him during an event@@ ful period , in the pec@@ uli@@ ar position to explain what he could not have meant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after he had made the clari@@ fying of a campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump had made his asser@@ tion on Thursday and consisted in interviews that he did not int@@ end to signi@@ fy the President and Mrs. Clinton .
but in an early morning twe@@ et Mr. Tr@@ ump said , he was just sar@@ c@@ astic .
unlike the previous day , Twe@@ et was contrary to Mr. Tr@@ ump in a number of interviews he said the accus@@ ation was completely serious .
when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ oder@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t wanted to we@@ aken the statement , that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS , wanted nothing to know the Republi@@ can Presi@@ dential candidate .
the last storm of criticism drops down to Mr. Tr@@ ump while he tried to focus on his campaign &apos;s focus due to falling cargo values to the economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton held spe@@ e@@ ches to the economic situation in Michigan , this week .
on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump tried again to return to this topic .
he warned on Twitter that Mrs. Clin@@ tons &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he had found their speech boring .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of July he put strong criticism when he said , the Russians should get Mrs. Clin@@ tons &quot; emails but later he declared &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Of course I said the sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to shift the language barriers in politics and then return to demand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages of his fans will be taken , as they arrive , and then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert , the language of both candidates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but I think he is smart enough to keep his testimony vag@@ ue enough , so that they can be interpreted in a different way .
instead of def@@ using the sound for the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump has taken a still cor@@ rosive tone , because its cargo values have gone further .
a new survey conducted by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ is who was published on Friday , showed a guided tour with big lead in the states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump is trying to excuse for his pro@@ voc@@ ative remarks , he often accused his critics to dist@@ ort his testim@@ onies or to understand his hum@@ our .
but while he is focusing on the focus of attention in recent months of its presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps joke has brought his loyal companion to him , regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative might have his remarks .
Rudolph W. Giuli@@ ani , former Mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ um@@ ps most prominent advoc@@ ates , has made great effort to defend the candidates in a CNN @-@ interview from Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe what he says are legitim@@ ate , political comments &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Giuli@@ ani so he was asked about the correc@@ t@@ ness of Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps , whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true in this sense that before Obama was an almost unknown , small organization , he called them am@@ b@@ anners , completely wrong , and so it happened because he with@@ drew the troops from Iraq .
most ma@@ inst@@ ream rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to argue that the Obama administration , in Mrs. Clinton , served as an Secretary of State , has allowed to spread to spread the situation in the Middle East and under control .
before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media , and threw himself against them in any of his words and must be bi@@ ased against him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he de@@ fied the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; TV experts , who try to understand him and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t understand it ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the Democrats spread over Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps sorry as a further proof that it was un@@ suitable for the presidential guard .
once upon the price of the market , café in Green@@ point comes back
Ver@@ b Cafe was a sh@@ ab@@ ated café in William@@ sburg , where you could only pay cash , but no Wi @-@ Fi , but 15 years long good coffee served .
of course , the prices of his Bed@@ ford Avenue Lad@@ en@@ front was pushed forward .
the shop So@@ ap Ch@@ ery , replaced by Ver@@ b in the summer of 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
native people considered the last loss in a serious city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the artist Mol@@ ly Cra@@ b@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know , New York is change , but I still can &apos;t believe that C@@ oh@@ ull is dead , the Chelsea Hotel except and ver@@ b is a soap business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but if New York change is , it is also new .
a re@@ vit@@ alized ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new ver@@ b has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same employees and a similarly simple atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the Ver@@ b is Cisco Rodri@@ guez , a long @-@ standing employee of the old cafe , the owner and managing director of the new cafe .
he began working in Ver@@ b in 2001 and remained there until the end .
when a customer offered to provide money for a new outside , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ guez , 36 , kept much in mind .
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for bag@@ els , the same es@@ pres@@ so machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old ver@@ b .
but Rodri@@ guez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu , sand@@ wi@@ ches with bacon and cheese and there are gar@@ ages such as cap@@ ers and auti@@ ous onions .
there is natural bowls .
the café serves no beer any more , but fresh ju@@ ices are available .
after nine months Rodri@@ guez said he had noticed a stub@@ born stream .
&quot; many old customers were also pressed by Prices of William@@ sburg , &quot; he said .
recently , on a Sunday Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in William@@ sburg earlier and visited Ver@@ b regularly .
even after being drawn to Green@@ point , it would take the way forward .
after the ver@@ b had closed , she gave a while to the coffee , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was clear to me that I was at the coffee and the culture in the Ver@@ b who liked it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now they drink coffee again , even if they be@@ aded a Bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea with this day , which is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a long @-@ standing and loyal customer since the start of the Ver@@ b in 2003 .
he went there before work and always ordered the same .
&quot; I came to seven , every day , like a Swiss watch watch , and they prepare my Everything @-@ Ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; he said .
Foto Rodri@@ guez said he wanted to experiment and put new ingredients in the menu .
today Ros@@ enthal gets still his usual order , but sometimes he altern@@ ates his Everything @-@ Ba@@ gel with bacon , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ guez said he did not understand a den@@ ll that the soap business has taken the old business room .
in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie used to produce a special soap for ver@@ b with cold spra@@ yed coffee of the coffee shop as an ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we will go down to her offering , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ guez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional , Polish inhabitants Green@@ points have also accepted the café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ guez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to make them soon , so that his new neighbours will feel welcome . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the site also has further advantages .
a local juice supply would like to fill and sell cold spra@@ yed coffee into bottles .
there is a chance that the café is expanding to a neighbouring building .
a new ver@@ b is sufficient for many customers to get their old favor@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said that he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed .
when the new cafe opened , Wh@@ itt said that the subject of Lok@@ als and the Order had a new coffee as a hom@@ ec@@ oming .
&quot; I had to smell it , &quot; he said .
the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; a rich meal &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after its ascent to the President Franklin Del@@ ano Roosevelt took his lunch at O@@ val Office .
as a g@@ our@@ mets , President Roosevelt had a pen@@ chant for refined Del@@ ic@@ at@@ essen Fifth Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de Fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland water tur@@ tle fish soup .
his menu on this day was a bit more modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and as dessert a pl@@ um @-@ men@@ p@@ ud@@ ding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jane Z@@ iegel@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; There was also a message to Americans , as they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food hist@@ ori@@ ans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ es last book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worked out of Chinese cuisine in the USA while Z@@ sealed in her book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about living in a residential home on the Lower East Side of the food perspective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday at the Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity when they meet with a rep@@ orter in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sandwich Shop , a small , schn@@ ör@@ k@@ ell@@ os@@ em I@@ mb@@ iss in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in store since the stock market crash in 1929 .
bri@@ ck@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh milk back with olive pieces , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key , boiled m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable mixture .
when the rep@@ orter found Hack@@ ney , this found the couple for a discussion about the food in the era of Great Depression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rich food were very popular , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said brick . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were pean@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread .
they were prepared from an ingredient and a bit cheap that stretches the ingredient .
imagine , so many pean@@ uts have to eat that they serve them as dinners .
Co@@ e gr@@ in@@ ste .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must have been in the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ you @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at @-@ Buffet .
teams of women co@@ ded for male ri@@ ots and it was served fresh baked past@@ es for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there were Americans who sent food to a hungry European world during the First World War . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shows the path that the country went with it , no longer the lar@@ aff@@ en@@ land . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time in the food for the Americans a central , divided topic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; beg@@ ged Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
just as ten@@ se was the new Bud@@ get@@ di@@ es : mysterious dishes such as bread and cold water have become a stap@@ le food , the c@@ asser@@ y as &quot; wonderful way of re@@ productive resi@@ dues , &quot; noted bricks , because Kö@@ che could hide un@@ appe@@ ti@@ zing ingredients under a cre@@ amy sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced by cheap d@@ rought .
meat that had been the centre of American cuisine for years was a rarely serv@@ iced luxury .
pec@@ uli@@ ar compounds have been tried out , as a cal@@ ory and nour@@ ishing satisfaction had prec@@ e@@ dence over flavor or even healthy food stood .
while studying for the book that also includes recipes , bricks prepared a dish made of this ep@@ och , baked onions with pean@@ ut butter , too .
&quot; it was not a popular supplement on the mid@@ day , &quot; says Co@@ e .
Bri@@ ck@@ mann continues : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pean@@ ut butter and fried onions do not fit together .
it was typical for many of the household concepts .
like never before or ever since , that fiscal econom@@ ists - including Louise Stanley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 @-@ 1943 - the country &apos;s eating habits .
&quot; &quot; &quot; having published recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines , they encourage women to become &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bud@@ get@@ ary &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the challenge to transform p@@ amp@@ ons like cre@@ amy sp@@ aghetti with carrots in delicious meals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; is a feast of historical treats .
particularly tasty is the reports of the government &apos;s response to star@@ ving citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ vers L@@ ass @-@ Me @-@ Cake @-@ Essen .
while he publicly praised the simple Iowa farm kitchen of his kitchen , he served as the one @-@ million@@ th man of the world to whom he became .
&quot; he liked continental kitchen like fish with cucum@@ bers , &quot; said Co@@ e .
he ate in a almost g@@ ild@@ ed dining room and took a smo@@ king .
he was a wonderful reality .
President Roosevelt would perhaps have committed the same mistake , if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had promp@@ ted him to equi@@ p an example with his stomach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as described in the book , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a house@@ keeper with no interest to flavors &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Ms Roosevelt would suggest that the White House brought the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most controversial food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the types of great depression in the era of Great Depression was rejected once the country was back on the legs .
the legacy is based on our continuing focus on calories and food , Z@@ bri@@ man said , as well as science was applied to food .
the couple gave much better to understand the book &apos;s eating habits in law in law - for example how they could not throw away food .
&quot; she had a real fear of waste of food , &quot; said Co@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; brick rec@@ alled : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she actually made people ill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the wind@@ mill incident .
after the plates were left off at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they moved and co@@ es out a dessert , which they prepared at home : the pl@@ ums that President Roosevelt had lunch for lunch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Z@@ iegel@@ man and added that it was a usual trick to miss a nice name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were no proposed cream , just pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everyone showed something contradic@@ ted a spoon into the tough , brown gli@@ b@@ ber .
amaz@@ ingly , it was not bad .
Co@@ e took up three times a night .
&quot; &quot; &quot; like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ dies he said to his wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A few min@@ ced wal@@ nuts would help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
killed during bombs : he was the Ale@@ ppo hero .
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khaled Omar .
he was the ruler of Ale@@ ppo : Khaled Omar dedicated his life to man in Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old died in a Fass@@ bomb attack on the Assad regime .
Omar was a member of the &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a civil protection group , who so far ret@@ ched the lives of 60,000 people so far .
29@@ 00 volunteers set their own life on the game to attract people from bom@@ bed houses and to make their first aid in the war zone .
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
Omar was the face of the group : a video of civil servant that shows him during an 11 hour rescue a babies from the ruins of a house , went to the world in 2014 .
it made the Syrians of the shining symbols in the hor@@ ror of war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as heroes , he never saw himself , said according to the image : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , this is the genuine Ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I die to save lives , I think God sees in me a mart@@ yr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before Omar himself fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria .
the helicop@@ ters rejected four versions of the Alz@@ adia district , a chlorine gas filled with chlor@@ am@@ gas .
one woman and two children died , seven people suffer from respir@@ atory tract .
&quot; we now remove the toxic remains of the bomb , so that no children can play with it , &quot; quotes his last words before he died .
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to hit terrorists .
Grön@@ land@@ hai : the oldest sp@@ ine is nearly 400 years old
rare sight .
Grön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie usually come to the surface only in winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to go back to the sea after an investigation on board ship S@@ anna .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats with a 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Grön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie got only about 150 years of offspring .
the Greenland airport swi@@ ms down the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour he has an average of 1.@@ 220 meters .
only when it comes to it , the five meter long animal speeds on sat@@ in 2.6 km / h - and this top speed is half as fast as a Rob@@ be .
this one of long @-@ term lifestyle seems to be a sponsor &apos;s concept for a high age .
Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; Science &quot; at any rate from a Greenland who could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; mad@@ ness , &quot; commented Alexander Sch@@ atten@@ lein from the Max Planck Institute for demo@@ graphic research in Rostock , this lif@@ espan which means for ver@@ te@@ br@@ ates a world record .
although the Evol@@ ution@@ bi@@ ologist already assumed that Greenland &apos;s stone may be pet@@ ri@@ fied .
only the evidence failed .
Grön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie are difficult to observe , eventually they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated co@@ asts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard .
because they are water @-@ temperatures of the six degrees Celsius , they usually immer@@ se them in the surface only in winter .
scientists know very little about the lifestyle of Greenland .
her time@@ pent@@ emp@@ o measures it , when you cut six animals in front of S@@ val@@ bard , with a broad@@ c@@ aster .
however , these shar@@ ks make these shar@@ ks : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a Rob@@ be , another had swallowed up the jaw bone of a young polar bear .
you may ch@@ ase them sleeping animals or pat@@ rol on the bottom of the ice cream and look for cad@@ aver , which tor@@ ch from higher water layers according to bottom .
Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues studied 28 Greenland and the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland and S@@ val@@ bard as by@@ catch from the depth of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cen@@ tim@@ eters long , whereas the largest 502 cen@@ tim@@ eters dimension .
to determine the age of animals , they analyzed the carbon core of the shar@@ ks with the carbon @-@ 14 method .
this centre of eye lens already arises in front of the birth of the shar@@ ks which contained proteins are no longer renewed .
the two smallest shar@@ ks had a much carbon @-@ 14 in the core core .
its birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s , when nuclear weapons tests a large amount of this radio@@ active carbon in the atmosphere .
in the length of 220 cm length , the Lin@@ sen@@ core contained a low surplus to carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons , so it should have celebrated its 50th birthday at its investigation in 2012 .
in contrast , all the larger Greenland varieties had normal carbon @-@ 14 amounts , which is created by cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 clock showed an age of 335 years for a 4@@ 93 cen@@ tim@@ eters long Greenland , while the record shar@@ k should be 3@@ 92 years old even 3@@ 92 years old .
that Grön@@ land@@ hai @-@ females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known .
now the researchers were able to associate a age .
since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 cen@@ tim@@ eters were probably at the threshold of the sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years , Grön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie with the multip@@ lication seems to be at least one and a half centuries .
this should also be the world record for ver@@ te@@ br@@ ates .
that such meth@@ yl em@@ es live above all in icy waters is no co@@ incidence .
also the previous record holder , a 211 @-@ year old Greenland , in whose bacon on the neck was a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ po@@ on top was captured on Alaska .
due to the low temperatures , the organism of living animals living there often also live on spar@@ rows .
so they mature later - and they slow down .
in order to keep warm in cold water , the animals are often particularly large .
for the volume grows much faster than its surface , through which the animal keeps heat .
the heat loss of one gram is therefore much larger than in one gram elephant .
another advantage : they have less enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a smaller animal lives so dangerous and should concentrate on it as if possible to have as many descendants as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains the Evol@@ ution@@ ary biolog@@ ist Sch@@ advent@@ lein as soon as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a very big animal should rather invest his resources in a long life .
building site in double pack
with themes around building , the municipal council in recent meeting has dealt with major focus .
with relief , the committee adopted the message of mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; finally , the marketing of the recently reported housing belts can begin . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the property , par@@ zel@@ li@@ ation and closing questions , and the mot@@ ions could be placed on survey@@ ing , the sale of plots in residential areas &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; street &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( area Bin@@ der@@ straße - Extension section 1 ) is nothing more in the way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the municipal council is convinced that the construction work in the rural and peaceful residential community Schön@@ au young families and f@@ ather@@ sen@@ iors alike .
as it was called , building content may be informed immediately in the town hall , on the awar@@ ding of the par@@ c@@ els is expected to advise the municipal council in its September session .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to continue requests to res@@ ett@@ lement further commercial companies , the municipal council decided to re@@ tire until the spring of this year , newly created . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , in the area of Unter@@ timeless , the industrial area expanded by two plots towards the state road 2@@ 112 .
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ xit
therefore , the City of Main has the best chance to attract new jobs and companies in London , Dublin and Luxembourg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt benefits most of Bre@@ xit vote , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , Head of the Compet@@ ence Financial Markets and Real Estate Markets of the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the Bre@@ xit referendum , it is uncertain that money markets continue to operate from London &apos;s financial transactions throughout the EU .
for the so @-@ called EU passport , approval is sufficient for them in the UK .
this has just been using major US banks .
several banks have already announced to shift jobs .
the lob@@ by@@ union &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; reck@@ ons with 10000 new jobs in the Main within five years .
for Frankfurt , such as the I@@ W , the headquarters of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks of the euro@@ zone , as well as other important authorities such as the European insurance policy E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk of risk ES@@ R@@ B .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) , however , is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to the emergency tank is important for banks , as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luxembourg also heated a big fund sector , but as well as Dublin in the infrastructure .
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the big airport .
further points the city with slightly available commercial real estate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris , it &apos;s not easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ ack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the Seine , the rent for first @-@ class commercial real estate is 50 percent higher than on the main .
in addition , Frankfurt offer higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical supplies and infrastructure , and less crime .
in a ranking of the company advis@@ ory Mer@@ cer , the town fell to No.@@ 7 , Luxembourg in place 19 , Dublin on No.@@ 33 and Paris at 3@@ 7th place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; although quality of life is a question of pre@@ ferences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its strong position as a financial location for the European domestic market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the I@@ W tor@@ ates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but London , however , will remain the most important financial centre in Europe despite the Bre@@ xit vote .
the crisis rati@@ os in London also speak : in London , according to figures of Landesbank Hel@@ aba , around 14@@ 4,000 people in the banking industry , in Frankfurt , it was 6@@ 2500 .
Gilead gets right @-@ cost of the hepat@@ itis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
a US in@@ verter decided that Gilead &apos;s Sciences Inc is entitled to a refund of the right costs that you were created from the Hep@@ at@@ its C dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June Gilead was freed from a damages deposit of $ 200 million for the injury of two patents of Mer@@ ck , which in connection with block@@ bu@@ ster drugs S@@ ov@@ al@@ di and Har@@ v@@ oni of Gilead , after a US judge a pattern of mis@@ behaviour on mer@@ cks , including Mein@@ ei@@ des and other in@@ eth@@ ic actions .
when referring to the complaint on Thursday , U.S. official judge Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to reimbur@@ sement of costs , which were created during the defence of the F@@ alles .
Mer@@ ck is trying to mount Gilead , which domin@@ ates the market of a new generation of hepat@@ itis C drugs that can cure about 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
the case goes back to 2013 , when Gilead and Mer@@ ck received mut@@ ually def@@ endants and property on laboratory works , of which Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir ad@@ mits to those of active ingredient in the medicines of Gilead .

Clin@@ tons earn 10,@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % Federal taxes
Hillary Clinton published their tax return for 2015 on Friday , this resulted in the Presi@@ dential candidate of Democrats and her husband a income of USD 10,@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4,@@ 2 % .
in 2015 , the Clin@@ tons donated $ 1 million for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former president Bill Clinton achieved an income of USD 3 million by Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster &apos;s former Foreign Minister for her book on her office in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
Clin@@ tons candidate for Vice President , Senator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , published together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton his tax declaration in the past ten years .
they paid a effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; Hillary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; gave Clin@@ tons fighter hel@@ per in Jennifer Pal@@ mier@@ i .
in a contrary , Donald Tr@@ ump hides behind false pron@@ unci@@ ations and re@@ mun@@ eration with regard to his previous promises to publish his tax returns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax returns , although they are not obliged to do this for the law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his attor@@ neys have stated as a reason for his ref@@ usal to control the tax authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the train , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Clin@@ tons &apos;s Choice V@@ ote in Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , referring to the publication of the Presi@@ dential candidate of Democrats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday Michael C@@ oh@@ en , Tr@@ um@@ ps Special Advisor said to CNN , that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to publish something before the controls are not complete .
Tr@@ um@@ ps critics , among others also the Republi@@ can Presi@@ dential candidate of the year 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney have already heard that his ref@@ usal would have questions regarding wealth , his donations for char@@ itable organisations , his business partners and various other compounds , especially with Russia .
Clinton has already over@@ thrown himself on the issue and published a video on the Internet in the high level of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans Tr@@ ump to publish his tax returns .
on Thursday she spoke also during a speech to the economy in Michigan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ref@@ uses to do what each other candidate has done in the last decades and publish his tax returns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said too much . &quot; &quot; &quot;
POL@@ IT@@ ICO has reported that tr@@ ump has not paid any or very few taxes for two years , and an economic journalist of the New York Times cited a number of tax @-@ lawyers and tax advis@@ ers , the indications that this could still be the case .
Bundes@@ govern@@ ors have become a theme in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a regulation that is named after a billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett that people earn more than USD 1 million a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during a campaign for Hillary Clinton in Omaha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called for his seat in Omaha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka , whose Ber@@ kshire H@@ ath@@ away Industri@@ ek@@ on@@ glomer@@ ate here his seat , Tr@@ ump to exchange their tax returns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Buff@@ ett said he was also subjected to a tax test of IR@@ S and Tr@@ ump have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before voters and not before tax authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clin@@ tons &apos;s campaign has published tax returns to the year 2007 .
the Clin@@ tons , who now live in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , paid an effective federal tax rate of about 32 % between the years 2007 to 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 4@@ 0.5 % .
the 2015 tax exemp@@ tion showed that this was only USD 100 of their income as a reward , unlike most of all Americans .
its main investment was a cost @-@ effective index fund from which the Clin@@ tons Divi@@ den@@ ds and yields of USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 were tax@@ ed .

con@@ doms with Ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ der , Fire @-@ co@@ il@@ ation promote Tanz@@ an@@ ias Ele@@ phant@@ astic Protection
natural protective in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodox way to prevent eleph@@ ants from passing by people - they throw con@@ doms on them that are filled with ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ ties .
the method has proven to be effective as effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , which has already exerc@@ ised the idea of promoting volunteers in the north of Tanz@@ an@@ ias , trained to use a non@@ violent stri@@ ped method to protect their houses and crops without harm animals .
previously , many spe@@ ars have used to defend itself .
Friday is a world day dedicated to animal protection .
&quot; since we have developed the ... Tool@@ kit , we could observe an amend@@ ment to their attitude , with them much more confident that they can stop the eleph@@ ants from their fields without harm the eleph@@ ants from their fields , &quot; said the Managing Director of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Damian Bell in a Communication .
the first two steps include the light of the eleph@@ ants with a tor@@ ch and the bubbles in a horn .
when he is not deter@@ red , a so called &quot; ch@@ ili@@ ft &quot; is thrown .
ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ mi@@ xt with earth is packed together with a fire@@ work body into a con@@ dom , whose end is turned to the ignition only .
when it is lit , the con@@ dom is heated with a b@@ ang and spra@@ ys fine dust to ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ bic in the air .
as a rule , a hint was usually taken to hunt the eleph@@ ants .
one last way is a thro@@ wer , who sho@@ ots a golf fire in the air , causing a loud , light explosion .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; basically we welcome new business operators , but at this location in the exp@@ on@@ ated location on the Rhine River , the ki@@ osk does not fit &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath for the CDU faction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jewish director defe@@ ats Berliner Hotel , because Israeli sen@@ sel@@ ects has been removed after &quot; Arab &quot; - RT News
&quot; &quot; &quot; a French director with Jewish roots cap@@ tiv@@ ated a media watch@@ man after he betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski Bristol hotel has not listed Israeli elections , since it had called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an Arab guests &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to an employee . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Hol@@ oc@@ aust@@ Document@@ ation &quot; Sho@@ ah &quot; worked out his anger at the Kemp@@ inski Bristol hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German magazine FA@@ Z .
during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel on the list of the hotels .
however , the country was not listed among the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room .
how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , possible that Israel has been eliminated and deleted ?
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Bristol offers a possibility to choose Israel through an independent Call Center .
after a explanation , the director was looking to the hotel reception .
the answer that he got there , &quot; shot him , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel stated that the measure had a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of management of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason that was behind it , solved even more anger in the director .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the election is deleted &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the employee was quoted by Lanz@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das Handels@@ man called this a &quot; great dis@@ grace , &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung reports .
we were horri@@ fied and troubled by this event .
that is really very sh@@ ame@@ ful .
the fact that this is worn in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even greater dis@@ grace .
this does not need any explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the right conclusion &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the ministers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident triggered a pretty big response from the Internet , where people called the whole a sc@@ andal .
some submitted the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that would have had the alleged &quot; or@@ age of Arab guests . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shame you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; named it in another post that was pointed out that the hotel , which is located at the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , close to a synagogue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel quickly pointed all the accus@@ ations from himself and called the incident an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dis@@ ap@@ ologi@@ an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Lanz@@ mann , Der Spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there never existed a direct order , &quot; Israel did not include into the quick selection list , &quot; cited the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung a speaker at the Kemp@@ inski Hotel .
it adds that the country code has now been added .
police deplo@@ ys Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as &amp; rubber cover against protest@@ ing Brazilian students
students gather together on Thursday in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo with the police , when they were assembled to demonstrate against the government &apos;s reforms .
the police put Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and rubber cover against the protest@@ ers .
the difficulties began when police officers were trying to work out what led to the police in rubber and Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as police .
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations to express their const@@ ern@@ ation over the plans .
according to the suggestions of the Govern@@ ors of Sao Paulo Ger@@ aldo Al@@ ck@@ min , some less than 100 public schools are closed while 300,000 students are being implemented to save money .
some of the Protest@@ ants saw gra@@ ffiti against the preliminary President Michel T@@ emer &apos;s walls spray .
the recent protests occurred some days after protest@@ ers went to the streets to support the suspended president Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff that had been dismissed from the post by a vote of the Senate .
trading between Russia and Iran suddenly rise to 71 % - RT Business
with the abol@@ ition of the sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ h@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the trade agreement between Moscow and Teheran rose by 7@@ 0,@@ 9 percent .
since the international sanctions against Iran , the interest in Russian companies grew strongly in stores in the country , the ambassador did not share .
Russian companies set up existing compounds with Iran , while new companies are willing to provide access to the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , another trade construction is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said D@@ z@@ h@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he noted that the trade sum@@ s between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2016 rose by 7@@ 0,@@ 9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 , and $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , Russian imports increased by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran , and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
the trade show was reached by deliveries of machines , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; the ambassador said .
D@@ z@@ h@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan goes for this year from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
last year , Russian foreign exchange issued some 35@@ ,000 Vis@@ as , primarily travel to Iranian citizens .
in addition , Iran reached the top 20 countries that concerns the tourist number in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia have been broken , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , only a few Russians visit Iran , something of whom the ambassador hopes it will change .
&quot; I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d , who received the monuments of the old Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; he said .

S@@ cot Call@@ um Sk@@ inner is stor@@ ming back home when Br@@ it achieves gold for cycling
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner &apos;s last evening in the Vel@@ od@@ rom in the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio to glory as the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 year old from Glasgow took the lead role , who had made his fellow country@@ man Sir Chris Ho@@ y to E@@ igen and made the legend hau@@ gh@@ ty when he had stor@@ med to home a victory of New Zealand &apos;s Favor@@ ite New Zealand .
England claimed a sho@@ cking victory four years ago , while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympics .
they repeated the trick , after arriving at the underground world championships in London , despite the return of Ho@@ ys only a modest sixth place .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as execution .
Ho@@ ys retired to conclude a gap , the K@@ ian Em@@ adi and Matt Cr@@ ampton tried to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man when they stayed when they saw potential in the vill@@ i that un@@ folds now .
Hin@@ der , Kenn@@ y - those four years ago with Ho@@ y vic@@ t@@ orious - and Sk@@ inner set up a Olympi@@ ord in the qualifying rounds , but the New Ze@@ al@@ anders wins the first round .
and the British Trio won the du@@ el with gold .
after his turn , after his lap , Kenn@@ y brought the team up and Sk@@ inner held it .
a strategy change made a great part of transformation that drove it to slow down in a higher gear to slow down it and allow to maintain the pace and above all Sk@@ inner .
Ho@@ y saw his position as BBC expert from his position and fell Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ der when they rose to the podium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 23 year old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and to make me a name .
we set up a Olympi@@ ord in the En@@ dr@@ unde and conquered the world champion .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph of 2012 on the side of Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys there were evidence that after a weak start , he deliber@@ ately fell to the track .
he returned this statement later and there was no ob@@ jection of England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
this time there was no problem with such a victory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it feels with all the UK flags on the tri@@ b@@ une like London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have joined the team in the last three months .
so far , we have come so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win at the Olympi@@ ad .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , which were won seven of 10 titles in Beijing and London .
if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress in the last five months , expect us to expect a successful five days in Vel@@ od@@ rom .
with the shape of Kenn@@ ys , it is in the field of possible that he repeated Ho@@ ys victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition .
that would be for Kenn@@ y - that was born exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on March 23 ( apparently most holy date for British sports ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal .
this would be the same from Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y takes part in the Sprint , which starts today and will start over three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 year old of Bol@@ ton said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels quite lonely to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If he wins two more gold medals , he should be defeated to kn@@ ights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only med@@ alli@@ ative competition in the day , but there were more good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ que@@ Wig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and Ow@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ hour race run .
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 .
the world record that won in London in 2012 was 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 .

the UK team relies on its strong railway team to domin@@ ate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a band of medals .
after a truly extraordinary representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio were shut down .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they played in the background &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the background , so the resign@@ ation of the technical director Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April in the midst of sex@@ ism and bul@@ b@@ ing@@ backs as well as the retirement of sizes like Ho@@ y and Victoria P@@ end@@ let@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;

future of the melt of Portland due to the lifting of the energy demand fra@@ grant
the future of aluminium mel@@ ts from Portland , Victoria - as well as hundreds of workers of workers - are on the game since the system operator will cancel the energy supply contract and thus deliver all delivery contracts , such as the supplying energy company .
this stage followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsi@@ dies to operate the system .
a subsi@@ dy for 20 years is going to be published in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the plant of AL@@ CO@@ A in Portland are at stake .
no less than 2000 jobs -@@ direct and indirect - could be at risk of closure .
in addition , it could cause dom@@ ination of dom@@ ino , because the melt some 10 per cent of the total power generation of Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as .
in 2014 , AL@@ CO@@ A closed the Point of Henry melt , leading to the last year to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea force .
the melt of AL@@ CO@@ A in Portland loses money and ris@@ ked a closure .
this step follows the lon@@ gl@@ asting spec@@ ulation regarding the future of the complex , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last@@ ly due to the current price of the plant .
AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminium melting plant with its Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , told that three other owners will announce their contracts .
the plant is located in the majority shareholder of a joint venture between AL@@ CO@@ A and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p shares smaller shares .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L goes from that the plant in Portland continues to run , which means an additional physical demand for electricity through the melt , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; divided the company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L said that the tre@@ aties so called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; backup transactions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should have entered into force from November 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contracts have a 12 month period of notice , so they will finish in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , AG@@ L comes from that contracts in the financial year 17 are contribut@@ ing to the revenue &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the electricity supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impacts on AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecast of strong dates for wholesale prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L divided the value of contracts already written in its annual decline in the amount of $ 187 million in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; expect@@ ation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; AL@@ CO@@ A said that the decision to negoti@@ ate the contracts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; skill to operate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or the melt of the melt and in@@ crimin@@ ate the supply of the melt &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US company said that 2010 has concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , who should have entered into force in 2010 , even if it is still a statement , why it came back from the contract .
in addition to the bad economic conditions of the industry , analysts believe in front of the possible closure of the Portland melting shop in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago facility near Newcastle .
in reference to the analysts at the beginning of the week , Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Portland annually began around 600 mega@@ watts and Tom@@ ago to power around 900 mega@@ watts .
should both systems disappear from the market , that would mean significant reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
and for us as a generator it wouldn &apos;t be good , &quot; he said .
more than just a kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an reality TV star , Kendall is on the cover of the September issue of V@@ ogue
Antonio J@@ enner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the Man@@ ag@@ an @-@ J@@ enner C@@ lans Kris is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September issue of US V@@ ogue .
Antonio , the brand ambassador of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der is and ran on the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced the news on her Inst@@ agram account on Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this Co@@ vers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crying &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot;
the disclos@@ ure of the Co@@ vers followed a bizarre ( or simply keeping up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ style ) , which shows the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ enner family ( with the exception of the problem ) Rob and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n as well as in the presence of her sister , Ryan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) , as they have forgotten the cover of her sister and that with a classical W@@ hole : they all have a surprise week .
this is the c@@ lich@@ é plot almost every birthday episode of a children &apos;s episode ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; you thought that we had forgotten you ? , &quot; with hon@@ esty of a character set at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) but Kris had to participate in this public@@ ity .
with regard to the September issue of V@@ ogue a new era of kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans started .
Kend@@ al &apos;s big sister Kim may she , as regards the V@@ ogue cover , have struck ( her and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were on it in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue is a league for itself .
the September issue is the most sold edition of the year for V@@ ogue .
with a circum@@ ference that re@@ sembles an image volume as a fashion magazine , the output attracts a large number of advertis@@ ers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista were from the 8@@ 32 pages of the rolling stock 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) .
disclos@@ ure of his Co@@ ver@@ stars will be eag@@ erly a@@ waited that in the last two years the magazine has gone through the magazine before the official announcement .
women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Campbell , Linda evangel@@ ista and Kate Mos@@ s .
in recent years , clearly more &quot; celeb@@ r@@ ities , the Mod@@ ules &quot; as &quot; models , the celeb@@ r@@ ities are &quot; on the cover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oscar winner and Di@@ or brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence has been on the cover in 2013 , a year after Lady G@@ aga had honor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but even with the low chance that Mrs J@@ enner - described by the magazine as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; breakthrough model &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of their generation - is located among the previous category , it is in good company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these celeb@@ r@@ ities are not related to famous people or the reality stars or you@@ ths of today , who know how to turn a good Snap@@ chat video ( even if anything goes to J@@ enner ) .
they are really talented women who are drawing in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once appeared on the last cover , had the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade a one of the most successful years of her career .
of course , J@@ enn@@ ers don &apos;t like success to everyone .
with its reality TV history , J@@ enn@@ ese &apos;s position was always stra@@ ined in the fashion world .
in June , the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ model Stephanie Se@@ ym@@ our J@@ enner and her colleague Gig@@ i H@@ adi@@ d critic@@ ized her &quot; the Mist@@ akes of the Moment . &quot;
these feelings return up again when the news came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the V@@ ogue cover .
but riding on the mist@@ ress seems to pass by the point .
Kendall J@@ enner is on the cover of the September issue of V@@ ogue .
it is a super@@ model in the sense of the word .
she runs for Marc Jacobs .
it makes advertising for your under@@ coat of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der .
she and all her sisters are selling to you on their respective Pay@@ wall apps .
she sells from her well @-@ made pictures of C@@ ind@@ y Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds &apos;s daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in their free time they can see in reality TV . probably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .
population centres propos@@ e 160@@ .000 people each year
more than 160@@ .000 of the country needs to be rejected by the common population , while the sector will impact on the impact of other medium @-@ reli@@ ed transactions .
in Queens@@ land , there are already three of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means of un@@ fair del@@ og@@ ations and the similar rules - in their search for free legal advice and legal services .
legal services of the municipality , which are already extinct , are ready for further reductions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; starting in June next year , this legal center will lose a further 30 percent of its federal agents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Director of the community centre of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell said that the last survey of the National Union of municipal council centers yiel@@ ded that thousands of people were exp@@ elled every year .
Far@@ rell said that the situation would be even worse without a repe@@ al of the decision of the federal government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Queens@@ land council centers are under@@ funded , which means thousands of people of important services that you need , rejected , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people who leave violent relationships , people with aw@@ ful and repe@@ ating debt , families , who have been dismissed by separ@@ ations , workers who have un@@ fair problems - all these people have problems legal way and this survey shows that they cannot receive the help they require .
in June 2017 , the Federal Government will cut the funding by 30 percent , which means that thousands of helpful people from Queens@@ land will be forced to agree with their legal problems without any help .
we urge the General Friends and Federal Minister of Justice as well as Sen@@ ators of Queens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to immediately raise this medium abbrevi@@ ations , so the people will need help to get involved in legal problems .
last year , the state government filled its promise to raise funds for legal services on the national average .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is now at the time to watch the needs of the community centre and their customer community as well as the government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k invested in this important work . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Berlin / Schwerin : survey before countries elections : SPD and CDU lose
in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) , substantial losses for the government fac@@ tions and the CDU continue .
this resulted in a representative p@@ olls of opinion research institution IN@@ SA for the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the red @-@ black government coalition could continue to gover@@ n in the north , this is not possible according to the situation in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in both states the SPD would be the strongest party and would have good chances to keep the heads of government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD collapsed from 3@@ 5.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent .
according to the survey , the party won only slightly ahead of the CDU , which could return to 23 percent .
third place is controversial between the Left and the AF@@ D .
at 19 percent ( previously 18,@@ 4 percent ) , the AF@@ D would be represented by 19 percent for the first time in the country day .
the Gre@@ ens still hes@@ itated despite slight losses with 6 per cent ( previously 8.@@ 7 percent ) in the s@@ uns@@ iner country day .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP were not represented by 3 percent in the country day .
as a result of the Berlin Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ enh@@ ancers , the SPD in the survey said only 23 percent ( of 2011 : 2@@ 8.3 percent ) .
the CDU reached only 18 percent after 2@@ 3,4 percent .
she was still working behind the Green Party with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but before the left with 15 percent ( before 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
with 14 percent , the AF@@ D was first represented in the Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties .
at 5 per cent , the F@@ DP could hope to return , the pirates would not miss the move in contrast to 2011 .
Nokia 9000 Commun@@ ic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ Mail and the Internet in Tim@@ lu@@ pe : 20 years ago Nokia &apos;s Commun@@ ic@@ ator came on the market .
the success@@ ors now domin@@ ate the world - its manufacturers experienced a disaster .
the equipment weighed almost half a kil@@ ogram and was more than four times as difficult as an iPhone 5 .
it was th@@ icker and bigger , so it was not good in the hand .
on the contrary , it was quite knock .
the built @-@ in memory was at first eight Meg@@ aby@@ tes , which would suff@@ ice today for approximately two be@@ ati@@ fies of high resolution .
an iPhone now comes with at least 16 gig@@ aby@@ tes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nokia 9000 Commun@@ ic@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , into the shops , and it was the first smartphone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a few euros lovers can buy the equipment on the Internet , but they come somehow from the time of the internet era .
20 years ago , the Commun@@ ic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier on the computer trade fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hannover as &quot; office in the West@@ ern@@ ers format . &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent and received for that time standards a lot : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received via fax was the Commun@@ ic@@ ator .
even the access to web pages was possible via HTML @-@ browser , if also sque@@ e@@ zing slowly .
a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be opened as a laptop .
then a small keyboard and a black @-@ white screen took place .
quite proud was the price : 2700 D @-@ Mark , i.e. approx . 1400 euros .
the average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
no one could notice in August 1996 that the Commun@@ ic@@ ator would become the start of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
smart phones are a success story if not for Nokia .
the Finn@@ s cell division experienced an un@@ preced@@ ented disaster that was finally sold to Microsoft and handled .
today , the market gover@@ ns the market which all came later than Nokia .
ever and anywhere online , this is today for a lot of people daily life .
in 2015 , there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide .
around 1.4 billion units sold to Samsung and Apple were sold alone by 5@@ 55 million units .
worldwide sales with the units are around 400 billion euros .
to do this , the well @-@ running business of the countless App providers and the t@@ elecommun@@ ications company are coming .
a whole industry is created around the smartphone .
the decisive breakthrough on the mass market came first in early 2007 , then Apple CEO Steve Jobs on Mac @-@ World announced the introduction of i@@ Ph@@ ones .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an Internet communic@@ ator , easy to use via touch screen .
the triumph@@ al march of Apple began , today the iPhone is the most important product of the group .
Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market , had to see .
finally , they disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
our days now have Apple and Asian suppliers such as Samsung .
the smartphone is a self @-@ understanding for 20 years after its invention .
today , in the meantime , each German has meanwhile met 88 times a day on his cell phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all need to learn to put the smartphone even once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , responsible for the Siemens management board . &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent acc@@ essibility has become a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must direct the Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row will not only be in our local mun@@ icipalities and throughout London , but throughout the country of renewal and prosperity .
for me , this was the biggest attraction of He@@ ath@@ rows , just as in 2012 in London when we had a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games .
the Olympics brought great benefits for Strat@@ ford and the East End .
and we will achieve this again by creating new opportunities for local and companies close to He@@ ath@@ row .
for our local communities alone , we will manufacture 10,000 new apprenti@@ ces to create 40,000 new jobs and prepare the youth unemployment in the airport environment .
as they were ahead in London in 2012 , they will be able to think that the challenge of enlargement He@@ ath@@ rows is too big .
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be bl@@ am@@ assing us on the world stage .
the two musicians were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to over@@ coming , but He@@ ath@@ row answered every given question .
like the Olympic Games , He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for individual infrastructure project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enlargement is a way to create up to 180@@ .000 new jobs , £ 211 billion to wit@@ ty growth and to leave a legacy of skills and employment both to the airport and in the whole UK . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has implemented a £ 11 billion higher infrastructure investment programme , from the T@@ 5 - the five years as a result of the world &apos;s best airport terminal , up to T2 , which was built in the midst of the two most frequ@@ ented cat@@ walk of the world .
now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment .
the 2012 London Games were a great success for GB and I am confident that He@@ ath@@ row &apos;s expansion will also be one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is time that we direct this Olympic spirit and build He@@ ath@@ row as well as creating our future commerce and create a legacy of skills and employment to be proud of the UK . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in the &quot; K@@ atz and mouse game &quot; regarding ad block@@ ages
&quot; &quot; &quot; for companies dealing with online advertising , make attempts to avoid advertising block@@ ages , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kat@@ z@@ - and mouse game &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block display block@@ ings on its desktop page , Ad@@ block Plus released a blo@@ g@@ post where users could update their filters in the program to block advertising in the social network again .
on Tuesday , Facebook shared that its des@@ kt@@ op@@ side would change the coding concerning its advertis@@ ements to identify it &apos;s notice , which is part of the page advertising .
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to circum@@ vent new codes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a blo@@ g@@ post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams , that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ und @-@ Her Figh@@ ters is underway since the invention of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; entic@@ ing Open Source Community and &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fact that the world &apos;s largest company for social media has launched in the fight is a powerful indi@@ z that has become a wor@@ rying indication for the industry .
according to a study conducted by Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe around 200 million people worldwide , according to a study conducted by Pa@@ fe@@ air ; almost four times as much in 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion a day of active users who access Facebook over their mobile devices , hand@@ y@@ des@@ ks makes 84 per cent of the value range fac@@ ebooks .
the company has on ad block@@ ages on desktop PCs , because mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on fac@@ ebooks mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ agram , shared a speaker .
advertising on desktop PCs make a sufficient amount of income , so Facebook will see the investment of such a step as worthwhile .
on Tuesday , Facebook announced that it would update his &quot; ad @-@ fer@@ encing tool &quot; to have more control over it to have completed advertising .
on Thursday , Facebook claimed that Ad@@ blo@@ c would have wor@@ rying new filters , because they would also block content on the side , which are no public@@ ity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for users this is not a positive experience , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a speaker on Facebook with an e @-@ mail message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad block@@ ers are a bl@@ unt means that we have concentrated on developing tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences instead , to put more control into the hands of people .
woman with suspected suicide on Swiss highway
the victim was lying in the middle of the night on the free@@ way .
the police calls witnesses to call after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday with a susp@@ ect suicide by several vehicles on a highway .
the incident occurred on the A1 motorway near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d just after midnight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a woman placed himself in the dark &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an act of despair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the road and were met by several cars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police in Vau@@ d . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is obvious that a Swiss company at the age of 49 , those of several vehicles , including a lor@@ ry , wanted to kill himself .
she died still on site .
several drivers have already been heard , but some have not yet been identified , said the police to report this , as well as every witness of the incident .
an investigation process was opened , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter told the Le Trib@@ une de Gen@@ eve .
however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed .
was a clas@@ h avoid@@ able ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is something which the prosec@@ utor must decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that the driver will not be with@@ drawn to responsibility .
in any of the two cases - with whom a person ran in the dark on the highway - was decided that drivers did not need to assume that a pedestrian in the middle of the night runs as it was in the newspaper .
last year a polic@@ eman of the negli@@ g@@ ent k@@ illings were acquitted when she had slain a man and had killed one night on the A1 in the proximity of Pay@@ erne in August 2014 .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk , and has become un@@ conscious on the road , the judgment took off .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the court noted that the polic@@ eman -- who had responded to an emergency call -- was a justified way and that the presence of a man on the road was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; completely extraordinary and un@@ predic@@ table situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the judge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
anyone who has more information about the incident on Thursday in the vicinity of Morges should sign up at the police under number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA Climate am@@ od@@ ell : Venus was once guarded
the Venus was probably hab@@ itable for the projec@@ tions of a new NASA climate model .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies , developed a model in order to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms , re@@ semble from climate research .
the model was designed to determine if the Venus could be upgraded with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere .
scientists have hin@@ ted that the slow revolution of the Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere .
but the newest simulation indicates that the Venus could have had a thin , er@@ d@@ less atmosphere and still slowly turned on .
the model also lighted the top@@ ography of early Venus .
the planet probably pointed out more dry areas than de Earth , but once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to accommodate life and protected against ev@@ ap@@ oration .
the early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation the slow revolution of the Venus exp@@ on@@ ates the slow revolution of the Sun for almost two months , &quot; said G@@ ISS scientists Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release .
this heat the surface and produces rain , which creates a thick layer clouds that looks like a umbrella on the surface of most of the sun heat sh@@ iel@@ ding .
the result are average temperatures that are some degree cooler than the Earth today .
the model created a story of Venus that re@@ sembles evolution that was previously conceived by planetary research .
although it was presumably inhab@@ itable , the Venus - in the course of over billions years --@@ too much heat and ultra@@ violet light was exposed .
their oceans had ev@@ apor@@ ated and their water vap@@ our were burnt away from ultra@@ violet light .
as its hydro@@ gen with@@ drew only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect - the Venus , which we know it today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy joins the Aval@@ an@@ che trainer
Patrick Roy came back as a coach and vice president Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che and led to a low @-@ determination role in the team &apos;s decision @-@ making .
&quot; &quot; &quot; alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and realized that the association will immediately look for a new trainer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the last three years I have assigned my duties as Head of Trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determin@@ at@@ eness , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in an opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
during the summer , I thought long and much about how I could improve this team to give him more depth , this requires it and bring it to higher level .
to achieve this , the vision of the Train@@ ers and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations have to be perfectly adapted to the organisation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he must also have a co @-@ determination in decisions that affect the performance of the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these conditions are not currently being fulfilled .
Sak@@ ic , who hired Roy on 23 May 2013 , than@@ ked him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; Patrick informed me about this decision , &quot; said Sak@@ ic .
we all appreciate what he did for our organisation and wish him the best for the future .
during his debut season with the Aval@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as winner of the Jack Adams Awards , the winner of the premi@@ er league for the league was awarded .
he resulted in the club on 112 points and on the first place in the Central Vision , but Colorado became in the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minnesota and missed in each of the two last years the post@@ season .
the Aval@@ an@@ ches recorded in the 2015 @-@ 16 season a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 stamp and fell behind the Wild for a second wild@@ card spot in the western Conference by five points .
Roy &apos;s Hall of Fame Tor@@ wart has won four Stanley C@@ ups -- two tracks with Montreal Can@@ adi@@ s and the Aval@@ an@@ che .
Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ öl@@ ers again take talks , set out strike
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the strug@@ gles for the re@@ mun@@ eration for North Sea workers are suspended , while all parties involved in a new round of talks on the table , said the negoti@@ ator . &quot; &quot; &quot;
strikes against the oil @-@ service provider Wood Group were spor@@ adic on platforms in the North Sea , run by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wood Group as well as the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT unions can confirm that we have agreed to re@@ iter@@ ate the moment of current Stre@@ ites , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in a common statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will keep a few daily sessions in the next few weeks , starting the beginning of next year to re @-@ start the problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the trade unions said that their last strike , who is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
wood Group took the install@@ ments to its contra@@ sts in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the company &apos;s rating will follow a 10 percent decline in on@@ shore contrac@@ tors in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company said that additional cuts to the company provides the required space in order to break the market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Shell has announced for his part of thousands of people and plans to spend his oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries as a result of its business activities as a result of its meg@@ az@@ us@@ c relationship with the British energy company BG Group .
energy companies are under pressure on the lower cru@@ de prices under pressure , an economic situation , which was strengthened by the British decision in June , the European Union .
the Scottish parliament , Dave Anderson , met with workers leader at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the largest employment agreements , which took place in the North Sea since one generation .
the North Sea is important for regional economy , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need an economy that works for many and not only for few , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion will be expected to spending new projects in North Sea as compared to an average of around $ 7 billion in the past five years .
Kepler measures rotary rate of stars in the star@@ ry of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with the Kepler Space Teles@@ cope helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalogue of rotation rates among the stars of the P@@ lei@@ ades .
the new data help the astronom@@ ers understand why stars are rotating at star@@ ry to different ranks as well as in what context the rot@@ ational areas with the planet origin stand .
&quot; we hope that we learn through the compar@@ isons of our results with other stars , more about the relationship between the mass of a dying , his age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the star@@ ry of the P@@ lei@@ ades is located 4@@ 45 light@@ years from the earth .
many stars in this star@@ ry , which originated approximately 125 million years ago , can now reach adul@@ thood .
they are now fastest in the world .
this gri@@ pping stars reach great amounts of stars coming from the stars .
as these winds are travelling through the stars of the stars , they have a slow effect on the stars .
when a star r@@ ushes , his rot@@ ational rate begins to slow down .
Kepler measures the rot@@ ational rate of every day by announ@@ cing the time between the appearance of a recognis@@ able star@@ fle@@ cks -- such as sun@@ spots .
the latest catalog of rot@@ ational rates indicates that mas@@ si@@ p@@ pled stars turn slower than less massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , whereby larger stars revol@@ t more slowly than smaller pi@@ rou@@ ettes .
&quot; at the Ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades , we see that long rot@@ ors tend to be massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the star@@ ry of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare Stell@@ ar qualities as rot@@ ational rates .
&quot; the Stern@@ enh@@ agen of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for the theoretical models of the stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; Reb@@ ull said .
it &apos;s still much ahead of us what we want to learn more about how , when and why stars slow down your rot@@ ational rates and say their &quot; dance shoes . &quot;
Reb@@ ull and her colleagues have reported in detail about their latest analysis of the P@@ lei@@ ades , which will soon appear in the Astr@@ onom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial Bas@@ eball @-@ Star is starting
with Alex Rodri@@ guez , tears ran faster than the US bas@@ eball @-@ star in the best days of Base to Base .
after his emotional withdrawal announcement , the 41 year @-@ old pro will carry against the T@@ ampa Bay R@@ ays last time the tri@@ cot of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say &apos; Good@@ bye &apos; , the 14 @-@ time all @-@ star game participants of the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) declared .
three times Rodri@@ guez was voted the most valuable player of the League , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es .
his signature , under a tenth year contract , issued 27 million US dollars annually since 2007 .
by the end of the contrac@@ tor on 31 December 2017 , he will be acting as a consultant and youth coach - in full content .
as a player it paid Rodri@@ guez long time with performance .
with 6@@ 96 hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas Rang@@ ers ( 2001 @-@ 2004 ) and since 2005 , he managed some milest@@ ones .
with the Hall @-@ of @-@ Fame members H@@ ank Aaron and Willi@@ e M@@ ays only two other bas@@ eball player in the most important statistics are similar .
however , 41 @-@ year @-@ olds should not be included in the hall of the hall of the bas@@ eball .
because so successfully Rodri@@ guez - nickname &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; - on the field was , that &apos;s the occurrence outside the place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already in 2009 the super@@ star gave &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to have banned ster@@ o@@ ids between 2001 and 2003 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in August 2013 , he was closed due to a settlement in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ andal by the end of 2014 for 211 games .
Rodri@@ guez is considered to be a major susp@@ ect for years about an anti @-@ aging clinic in south Florida .
in a legal dispute , the lock was still reduced to 162 meetings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the league could even have done a favour for the year 2014 , because I played 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rodri@@ guez said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even his deportation days did not go silent .
while many bas@@ eball le@@ gends got the big stage once more , Rodri@@ guez often had to sit on the bench .
&quot; my job does not include a crash tour . &quot;
&quot; my job involves the attempt to win any game , &quot; Lin@@ ear Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ardi .

Olympia 2016 : Chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are the first Dop@@ ing@@ ra@@ ins
because of a positive op@@ d@@ um , Wei@@ ch@@ the@@ ber Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland must not start in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games will be over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed by the first official d@@ op@@ pression .
an ignorant Ath@@ let@@ in would have won almost a medal .
before the seventh race day , the first official d@@ op@@ presses have become known for the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
the Chinese swi@@ m@@ pool Chen X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter obst@@ acle in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa from Bulgaria and the Polish weight lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski were tested positively and excluded - directly before the beginning of the already critical Athletics competitions this news came to the accident .
in Chen was diagnosed with hydro@@ chlor@@ othi@@ azi@@ de last Sunday , which is used as a mas@@ cul@@ ating agent for Dop@@ ing@@ substance .
the International Sports Court of Yugoslavia confirmed their exclusion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon .
on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ old had the fourth place in the final over 100 m Butter@@ fly , just around 0.0@@ 09 seconds , she missed the bronze medal .
on Friday , Chen would have allegedly participated in the predecessor of more than 50 m of Freist@@ il .
Chen has applied to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) opening of the B @-@ Test and a hearing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the national association take on the matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very serious and demands &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; serious cooperation in the investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cited X@@ in@@ hua from a communication : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will work with the International Sports Court of Justice and will accept the verdict . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first time in history is no longer the IO@@ C , but the CAS for the sanctions of athletes with positive cases .
also in the night of Rio , the news about the positive rehear@@ sal at Dan@@ ek@@ ova through which 33 @-@ year @-@ old went into the offensive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a tremendous shock , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; be innocent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplement , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the athle@@ tic race . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report it is supposed to act with the banned substance for the EP@@ O blood d@@ op@@ ing@@ agent .
after B@@ NT it was suspended , according to B@@ NT the B sample should already be positive .
Bulg@@ arians Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ v reported immediately with criticism at the Ath@@ let@@ in &apos;s word .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why the sport@@ s@@ men do not draw the right battles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We are Bulg@@ arians under observation , so many have been excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
about all the weights from the chronic d@@ op@@ ing@@ loaded nation may not take part in Rio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday the case &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was also known , the London Olympic Champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested like his brother Tom@@ as@@ z three days earlier on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ rol@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both den@@ ies the in@@ gest@@ ion , however , they may not start in class up to 94 kg .
before the start of the athletes , the case Dan@@ ek@@ owa is another heavy blow for the reputation of the whole sport .
the IA@@ AF world association had banned the complete Russian team until one exception because of systematic Dop@@ ings , Kenya also produced numerous bad news in Rio .
in the swimming pool , the earlier clubs in China had taken care of severe disputes between athletes .
thus the Fren@@ chman Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympics Sun Yang har@@ p .
&quot; sun Yang p@@ ink@@ elt purple . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I see the podium about 200 m Freestyle , I want to pass , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in the French Radio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was in the centre of a confron@@ tation with Australian M@@ ack H@@ ort@@ on .
&quot; I have no time and no respect for d@@ oping sc@@ amm@@ ers , &quot; said this .
sun was positively tested on the Chinese nationals for the stimul@@ ant of Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din , but had to sit down only a three @-@ week lock .
dat@@ kl@@ au : so per@@ fi@@ de cr@@ e h@@ acker their ran@@ som
program@@ ing malware program@@ mers are currently att@@ acking the targeted company - and are successfully involved .
according to a recent survey of the malware anti @-@ defense specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes under 540 companies in North America , UK and Germany , 40 percent of survey@@ ed companies in the past twelve months were at least once , partly multiple victims of an attack with Er@@ pres@@ ser software .
in Germany almost 20 percent of companies were already the target of a ran@@ som@@ ing ex@@ tor@@ tion .
40 per cent of the victims were willing to use the sol@@ ders offered by the perpet@@ rators to re@@ use the requested systems and data .
the perpet@@ rators speci@@ alize their black@@ mailing software according to observ@@ ations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes on attacks in corporate networks .
if they succeed , the potentially ran@@ smit@@ ter ran@@ som is significantly higher than in private users .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we watch today a sc@@ ary quick evolution of the malware , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ boss Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2008 , most of the Mal@@ war@@ e@@ programs were laid to send advertising .
then the perpet@@ rators of black@@ mailing software discovered .
first , private users were the goal , but the change to business attacks was fri@@ ghtening rapidly in recent months .
Ran@@ som@@ ware works after a simple pattern : once active on the computer of a victim , she searches for un@@ recently changed files such as Word@@ - , Ex@@ cel@@ - or Database Files as well as to archives of images and videos .
these files en@@ codes the ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als .
the software will then be presented by the demands of the Er@@ pres@@ ser .
to get the end code code to the files , the victims must be cash - mostly in the form of Cr@@ yp@@ to@@ bre Bit@@ coin .
but where private users are using the personal Photo database on the game , it goes to companies for sensitive customer data or project databases , without which the production is shut down .
accordingly , the damage exp@@ ires , if a ran@@ som@@ ware hits .
22 per cent of the affected German companies reported revenue losses due to Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent had to completely dis@@ rup@@ ted business activities , in one case , people were in danger of life .
in Germany , multiple hospitals were victims of attacks , whose patients may be threatened by the loss of ac@@ utely ac@@ utely ak@@ ut .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always say the victims : pay not , you only support the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay , their data will return .
for managers , it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpet@@ rators .
the h@@ ack@@ ers again know this and try to build a good reputation .
in a recent study the safety researchers of F @-@ Secure investig@@ ates the user interfaces and the contact with the black@@ mail and come to the result : the perpet@@ rators are actually trying to set up a kind of customer service to find more money .
they explain how they can pay by chat , as they can pay by Bit@@ coin , send freely accessible support sites , or de@@ cryp@@ t free sample files for free .
and individuals shall be redeemed after payments of a few hundred Euros , companies have to deal with hard negoti@@ ate and five digit sum@@ s to get their data un@@ encrypted .
given the potentially high and relatively ris@@ ky profits from the Ran@@ som@@ ware @-@ black@@ mail , h@@ ack@@ ers are always professional and share the work , explains security experts Che@@ ster Wis@@ nie@@ wski of the antivirus provider Sop@@ hos : &quot; a single person may write a ran@@ som@@ ware circa within a week . &quot;
more likely , it is that it is three or four people .
the program@@ mers sell their malware software then in the form of a software building box to the actual black@@ heads .
the malware kits were created by the malware kits , offering advice and additional tools for one @-@ time , solid price between 1000 and $ 10,000 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the scope of delivery includes an adaptation tool , so that smaller configur@@ ations , appearance and bran@@ ding can be changed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Wis@@ nie@@ wski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ex@@ presses are looking for further h@@ ack@@ ers to spread the newly purchased software under the victims .
we live in a service sector .
so , one of the forums in the underground , the set buys a crime and asks for another to install the software on a lot of PCs as possible .
payment is made per given calcul@@ ator .
&quot; usually , the crimin@@ als then carry sp@@ ammer with the spread , &quot; explains Wis@@ nie@@ wski .
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is well known for many companies that ensure their data better .
over 50 percent of companies in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes survey are confident that Ran@@ som@@ ware can be able to defend Ran@@ som@@ ware by file back @-@ ups and sc@@ ann@@ er@@ software .
the perpet@@ rators are already pursu@@ ing new strategies .
&quot; if the encryption is no longer sufficient for successful recovery , the perpet@@ rators im@@ press the release instead of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ boss Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski .
this makes the potential for damage , depending on the type of data , even higher than before .
the perpet@@ rators could also take new goals in the internet of things in the internet .
at the Hack@@ er@@ Conference Def@@ con demonstrated safety for@@ gers as they could have received with the Internet connected thermo@@ stat under their control .
in the middle of winter the activ@@ ating of such a blocked heating could be quite a ran@@ som .
if the perpet@@ rators will block the entire production line in a factory instead of heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also become a theme in Industry 4.0 .
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and everyday @-@ duty
in the small HR @-@ V , Honda will grab everything : a little SUV , a little cou@@ pe and even the versat@@ ility of a min@@ iv@@ ans .
sounds rather over@@ loaded , yet the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , has actually proved very flexible in everyday life .
although only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V works rather small , the passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the F@@ ond , there is no place closely .
the materials of the interior are well processed and are pleasant , only the cockpit upper falls below .
the HR @-@ V is more versatile than comparable vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is not only a trunk of 4@@ 53 l at high @-@ positioned and 10@@ 26 l at the reverse back @-@ rests , but there is the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is less magical than it sounds : the seat surface of the back bench can be folded as a chin @-@ up bar and thus provide storage space , which is 1.@@ 24 m high from the ground up to the ceiling .
the luggage boot can be loaded well , but the load @-@ height of 650 mm is slightly higher than in the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1.6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 HP acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in large speed ranges .
he is likely to perform his work somewhat qui@@ eter .
the everyday consumption of 4,7 l / 100 km is pleasing .
there is another motor@@ ization : a 1.5 @-@ liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
the behaviour is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort .
but the steering is likely to be more direct .
the equipment is not open in the tested Top @-@ variant &quot; Executive . &quot;
the safety systems belong to the City @-@ Not@@ bre@@ ms@@ coach ( works by pace 32 ) , the coll@@ ision war@@ n system and the sp@@ ur@@ king assistant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the coll@@ ision avo@@ ids sometimes because he over@@ sees many obstacles as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her@@ ent objects &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the distance assistance is very reliable .
and the intelligent tem@@ po@@ re@@ gler re@@ acts to traffic detection and thr@@ ott@@ les the speed .
but the full connectivity is only available for the top @-@ equipment : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , Nav@@ i , App @-@ Integration and More .
two USB@@ - and an HDMI socket are under the arm@@ rest and are therefore somewhat cum@@ ber@@ some to reach .
the approximately 29@@ 000 Euro for the well @-@ equipped top @-@ diesel are fine .
if you don &apos;t want to invest so much , the gasoline will get 20,000 Euros , the diesel from 23@@ 000 Euro .
the engines comply with the Euro 6 emission standard .
with HR @-@ V , Honda provides a versatile and everyday @-@ tag@@ ging car .
Air@@ line is not liable : fall on air@@ lift
an air@@ line is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger jet@@ ty .
for any liability is conc@@ ei@@ vable only with dangers that are typical of air traffic , the Ober@@ landes@@ gericht Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) .
the sound had broken down a kne@@ ec@@ ap at the down@@ fall .
however , the accident could happen everywhere - it is a common risk of living , so the court .
the airline had to pay no compensation for the man .
disease case : when paid the organis@@ er
after their journey only money gets back after their journey , when the cause of the illness is desper@@ ate to find at the hotel .
but this is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests have proven to show the same symptoms .
in the negoti@@ ated case , a family was severely affected by diar@@ rho@@ ea and vom@@ iting the second day of their turquoise .
she spent almost the entire vacation in the room .
their disease resulted in a defective case back , which supp@@ os@@ edly poll@@ uted the se@@ a@@ water .
the family was the view that we had been def@@ icient - and compl@@ ained against the organis@@ er .
before court , the K@@ lä@@ ger had no success .
although the her@@ b@@ ary situation was indeed defective .
but the organis@@ er knew only shortly before departure of the K@@ lä@@ ger .
until then , he had to assume that the se@@ a@@ water was fine .
he did not viol@@ ate his information , so the Jud@@ gment .
especially in the samples of water , no imp@@ ur@@ ities have been found .
the disease of several hotel guests - perhaps by infection among each other - belong to the general risk of life .
of 6@@ 91 guests only 38 people were ill .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mai@@ zi@@ ère , after the violence committed against refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people had worried about other attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the state should be so@@ ber and decided at the same time to act on terror .
for sure : our country will not answer the violence of the perpet@@ rator with hatred and split .
we won &apos;t get this triumph over terrorists .
if off@@ ences would have to leave the country , it increase the security and strength of the population for refugee policy .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère wants to achieve a implementation of the proposals until the 2017 parliament .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it also announced another person@@ alised rein@@ forcement of security forces , namely &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in medium @-@ digit range of mag@@ n@@ itude for several years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sympath@@ ies for terrorism will be under punishment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; video surveillance is to be improved , which will only be amended by the purchase of weapons on the Internet . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last much discussed sweat obligation for physi@@ cians should pers@@ ist according to de Mai@@ zi@@ ères words .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , in dialogue with the sleeve he wants to search for solutions , as the endanger@@ ing of the citizen can be reduced , he said with regard to psychological beliefs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to treat a radic@@ alization of refugees , the minister keeps a better social care for it .
teachers would need to be prepared better than dealing with trau@@ mat@@ ised people .
on the persecution of crimin@@ als in special areas of the Internet ( Dar@@ k@@ net ) , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère plan to use cover@@ ter investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD boss Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to enhance safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is important that the Interior Minister did clearly oppos@@ e action against action .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a cra@@ ck@@ band for the hin@@ ge makers in the CDU / CS@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gabriel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gabriel the newspapers of the spark of media ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had rejected calls from the Union to a Bur@@ ka ban and the abol@@ ition of double citizenship .
he den@@ ounces a general prohibition against full @-@ suffering he is subject to constitutional law .
you can &apos;t miss everything you are ref@@ using , and I reject the wearing of the Bur@@ ka .
talking about rules about road traffic or for witnesses .
green @-@ Che@@ fin Simone Peter threw the minister , he wants to sim@@ ulate new anti @-@ terror packages and action .
&quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ party leader Bernd Rie@@ x@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fleet of prover@@ bs and a deep@@ ening of the residence do not bring people to the people in this country anymore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
repair traffic flow on the motorway bridge
it looked regularly on the b@@ ypass road - here a picture of November .
but this should change : the de@@ fle@@ ction should be extended .
this is good news for all the car who are working in the occup@@ ational traffic on the ambient road every night in St@@ au when they drive over the motorway ( A 43 ) .
road construction extends on Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16th / 17th of August ) in the area between the Hammer Street and the descent Wes@@ er Straße , the right track for 700 meters .
drivers can then turn right from the Hammer street to the right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the big advantage : the traffic will present early , thus improving the total process on the most varied section of the highway 51 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea with the extended exit had the CDU faction in the District of Münster @-@ West .
driving on the Zu@@ br@@ inger turns the drivers before everything between 17 and 19 .
the return trip dates back to the bridge over the bridge on the Alber@@ tus Road and sometimes also .
reason is the needle eye on the B 51 just before the descent Wes@@ er Straße .
from here traffic will only be guided without trace along the motorway bridge .
the second lane had to be rebuilt over a three @-@ quarter years ago .
the reason : static calculations have shown that the bridge is no longer necessary to absorb the heavy duty for heavy traffic .
how long this bott@@ len@@ eck and the associated thrust of St@@ au will continue , the state company can &apos;t say .
however , it is expected to pay for years : because the bridge has an official resi@@ dual duration until 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the right track , the state company deliber@@ ately sought to pay off the traffic @-@ weaker time in school holidays because with disabilities .
traffic will be tra@@ cked on the site on Tuesday and on Wednesday .
Inter@@ cultural Journey : cultural opportunities for schools
the international class of the Wald@@ schule visited the theatre piece &quot; The invisible house . &quot;
the club N@@ ima &apos;s and the boy theatre now plan a musical project .

rain instead of Stern@@ schn@@ u@@ ppen : hope to improve the weather
the weather has made the star@@ ters Gu@@ ck@@ les in the southwest of Germany at night to Friday a walk through the bill - but there is still hope .
the night was not suitable for clouds and rain , to observe the sky &apos;s spectac@@ le , the chairman of the ob@@ servatory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning .
our hope is on the night for Saturday .
the weather should be good , then we &apos;ll see many shooting stars in the sky .
the star@@ ters is a Persian cycl@@ ist , which belongs to the fastest shooting stars with 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour .
they have their names , because they apparently come from the constellation Per@@ se@@ us coming up in the North East .
relaxing night : tips for sleeping disorders
in the evening you are going around forever , at night you wake up to hours , in the morning it is far from the wake @-@ up cl@@ ing@@ les to think about sleep .
that is anything but relaxing .
after all , one is in good company with such problems : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about one quarter of adults sleep and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing .
how do sleep problems or sleep problems ?
there are several forms of sleep problems , and there can be many causes of common causes , emphas@@ izes Hans @-@ Günter We@@ e@@ ß , member of the board member of the German Society for Schla@@ ff@@ icking and Sle@@ ep@@ medicine .
what you under@@ stands among them is , however , the In@@ som@@ nie , thus an entry and sleep distur@@ b@@ ance .
just to sleep through this , many people feel as uns@@ at@@ is@@ factory or in@@ adequate , Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht says , member of the German home@@ cian association with practice in the Lower Sax@@ on Var@@ el .
what &apos;s behind sleeping disorders ?
the causes of sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces are complex .
they can cause organic , psychological or behavi@@ oral factors , but also medicines .
not rare is the disorder expression of another disorder .
&quot; very early w@@ aking is often frequent during depression , &quot; says We@@ e@@ ß .
and it may be that different factors quote each other .
those who have a her@@ ni@@ ated disc can lie badly , w@@ aking up every two to three hours and starts bl@@ ur@@ ably to p@@ onder@@ ing about everyday problems and care , there is an example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
when should I become a doctor with sleep problems ?
who should not sleep well over a month of at least three nights a week , and is imp@@ aired on the day , should consult a doctor .
the imp@@ air@@ ment can look quite different : one is down@@ cast , tired , in@@ sufficient , has difficulty with attention and concentration , is slightly irrit@@ able , has mood disorders , or bodi@@ ly problems like stomach or head@@ aches .
to ease the sleep problems , it is important to find out their causes .
as a therapy options , such behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ oral therapy or even medications - classic sleeping pills only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - in@@ quire .
in Germany , Prof. Ingo Fi@@ etz@@ e , head of the Inter@@ disciplinary Medical Center of Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin , can hardly be emphas@@ ized in Germany .
therefore , one should consult with sleeping problems at first , advis@@ ing We@@ e@@ ß .
who can clari@@ fy studies , whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to sleep laboratory , and what happens ?
for instance , for exam@@ ining the sleep @-@ lab medicine , for instance , with snor@@ ing with respir@@ atory problems , in case of disease , or if you can &apos;t find the cause of a sleeping disorder , Fi@@ etz@@ e explains .
one does not need to prepare for the investigation .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; please do not make any mid@@ day sleep , &quot; says Fi@@ etz@@ e .
after sh@@ elling , one goes to bed in his normal time .
in addition to the electro@@ des on the body one carries a nostr@@ ils , a chest strap and a fe@@ at@@ ler on the finger .
it also features a camera on the ceiling of the sleeping area .
how can the problems get in the handle ?
there are quite a lot of pitch screws on which one can sit for better sleep .
We@@ e@@ ß is on : regular sleep and over@@ time , not too long in bed , don &apos;t sleep on the day , not watch television to sleep , avoid drinking alcohol and at night not at the clock - then you begin to calculate immediately , and that &apos;s all at all and not condu@@ ci@@ ve .
what the jungle camp with missing medals in swimming
the former German swi@@ mmer Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has expressed himself on Facebook for the most disappoin@@ ting cut of the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 he had brought gold for the first time in Doha and presented his first world record at the same time .
now the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ let Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has protected against his ex @-@ team @-@ te@@ amm@@ ate in the cr@@ iti@@ que of his critic@@ isms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a country in which an Olympic champion receives 20,000 € of award and a jungle @-@ King 150,000 € should no man wonder about missing Med@@ als , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the 26 year old in the night to Friday on his Facebook page . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the convey@@ ing system in the swimming pool is bad , the d@@ oping controls are very good .
with this , we can not compete with countries that are very much promoting and while d@@ oping do not run so accurately , or even run it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t say that controls are to be termin@@ ated here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
wanted to start a com@@ eback , D@@ ei@@ bler would have to be announced nine months before his initial launch of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( NA@@ DA ) .
it should be exactly the same way with countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who can not control a certain time before World Cup / OS of independent Controll@@ ers of WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A must not participate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls for election @-@ ham@@ bur@@ gers that operates an ice cream . &quot; &quot; &quot;
airport : Ban@@ de from Bag@@ gage
professional th@@ ie@@ ves at the airport Düsseldorf
civil servants of Düssel@@ dor@@ fer Police succeeded to capture two women and two men aged 50 to 61 years of age .
the susp@@ ect had perpet@@ rated several hand@@ bags and bags .
at 21.@@ 30 o &apos;clock civil servants were back in the field of Düsseldorf &apos;s Düsseldorf Airport , which was known for polic@@ emen from past theft .
the two women and two men had committed several Del@@ ik@@ te since mid @-@ July and had been collabor@@ ating and particularly professional .
the specialists of the crime fiction 34 can have entered Die@@ ben , who had traveled to Germany for the walk of crimes in Germany to show four actions .
they had carried out more than 15.000 Euro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; old buildings , a few left @-@ paths , a few left @-@ pav@@ ement : the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain doesn &apos;t work on the first glance , but the police is among the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dangerous places &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the city . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you go along the road from east to west , one comes along playing ground , a freshly painted kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ades pass .
at the facade of a grey house someone has &quot; ugly ! &quot; spra@@ yed .
opposite a Li@@ dl , which will soon be demolished , it will already be built : until 2017 there will be a house with high windows and 133 new apartments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; articles on this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trendy district &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as the competent real estate company Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain , will however be preferred by burning cars in recent weeks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents of the rental contracts , on the ground floor are still occupied rooms and are used for events .
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially the Berlin Interior &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Interior , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had been challenging several times for a hard advance of the police against the project , the area called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No @-@ Go Zone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after 22 June , the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schm@@ ie@@ de , had been cleared with 300 police officers , pat@@ rolled out parts of the road with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars in front , locked parts of the road and held visitors to enter the house with number 94 .
during which renovated building worker was commissioned by the owner of unknown home@@ owners .
on 13 July , a Berlin administrative court ruled that the clearance was illegal , and a day later , police and construction workers took up under the Ju@@ bel of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents .
on this summer afternoon , the road works peace@@ fully : parents walk with children , people sitting on the side@@ walk before the houses in the sun , others are talking about late Sp@@ ät@@ i .
in the immediate vicinity of the skin projects , an elementary school and nur@@ ser@@ y gardens are located .
the left force is not the main concern of many local residents : K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in Kiev since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , which attracts three children here , are mainly generated by the police presence .
with the residents of the skin projects , they share the concern of increasing suffering and gent@@ ri@@ fication .
it doesn &apos;t sound like a p@@ inch , who wish to become a majority @-@ reflection on the left .
the tren@@ ch , who built the Berlin Interior and the police force between home networks and their neighbours , does not seem so clearly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional business district , which also has an average income of income and high poverty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also home @-@ occup@@ ations and their native home projects have long been part of the Kiev : in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , including almost the entire Main@@ zer street near the Rig@@ a@@ er .
while the Main@@ zer had been evacu@@ ated under a regular police force , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Rig@@ a@@ er and are still inhabited by people who occupied them 26 years ago .
at the same time , the district in recent years has become increasingly becoming mag@@ nets for tourists and suff@@ ers from all over the world : now they share their lap@@ se from GDR times and former home networks .
this is also noticeable during the rent , which has increased by almost 60 percent since 2009 .
many of the new@@ buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are attacked as symbols for this development : they are recogni@@ z@@ able on applied discs or freshly painted fac@@ ades that were cast with color bags .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no other road was mentioned this year so often with the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ autonomous violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a reason why not all neighbours that consider it as a problem , could be that they are not necessarily affected by crimin@@ ality : off@@ ences such as body injury become almost exclusively against polic@@ emen .
the most part of the off@@ ences make things disappointed , which are more likely to meet new@@ builds and newly renovated houses .
for K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in a rental house for 17 years , cannot be persu@@ aded by un@@ certainty .
in terms of violence , it is important : people in 94 are their neighbours who don &apos;t have been this .
even the famous burning cars is no longer give up in the Rig@@ a@@ er anymore .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for this archit@@ ec@@ tom@@ y was not a criminal burning point , on the contrary : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here one helps one another , lives together on the street and gets more from each other than elsewhere . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is deliber@@ ately drawn into the Rig@@ a@@ er street - and stayed .
this is why it was so important that the local residents got their way back : from the police , politics and the media , which suddenly claimed the inter@@ pret@@ ations of the district in July .
but in the eyes of inhabitants like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road will continue to take away : through non @-@ historical buildings in former building g@@ aps that displ@@ ace old inhabitants .
&quot; these are ultimately con@@ domin@@ iums , which are not interesting for many , - here are people who are not so well covered , &quot; she says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violence and destruction I can absolutely not gu@@ ate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what should we do if one never list@@ ens to anyone ?
there is fru@@ stration at all sides , even by the police and the residents .
for early dra@@ ins that ten@@ se over colour bombs , K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the skin projects and the left scene belonged to the Kie@@ z .
who draws , should be aware of that - just like someone who moves to a pub , complain about noise there .
all mentioned persons have asked to have asked , not to be named with their right name
Ur@@ bach : An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is new refugee officers
An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact partner in the integration and organis@@ er .
also , she is social worker .
since July An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee treas@@ urer for Ur@@ bach .
the social ped@@ agog@@ y supports the team of managing Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
it looks as a contact partner for all players : refugees , working group refugees , administration , authorities and who else are involved .
Reg@@ ine customer of the working group indicates that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now being thank@@ ful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now there that has a problem above all .
thus , some - less sp@@ ot@@ ting than rather on the multitude of desired tasks - that meant , when managing the place wanted to write .
a management expert was sought out with a talent for languages and people , associated with a long @-@ term experience in social work , anim@@ ating a jeal@@ ous wo@@ olen .
but administrative work is not its central area , An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le comments .
above all , it concerns organization , work with the people on site and also behind the scenes as well as network activity .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
it has a 50 percent position on three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was high time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine client , that An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le and main actors are supported . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are large and small problems , organiz@@ ational , human and understanding problems .
soon new containers in the Was@@ enst@@ raße
it has been a significant problem for some time to find apartments for connecting flights who have been recognized .
the mun@@ icipalities are in charge of the provision .
they must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented residential premises .
the costs for construction , rent or renovation of these accommodations must carry the mun@@ icipalities themselves .
responsibility changes from the coun@@ rat@@ ory board and mun@@ icipalities .
problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been quite difficult for some time .
in fact , administration does not find private apartments .
so far , it does not have to be dependent on private apartments so Deu@@ sch@@ le .
thus , communities have to be er@@ ased , as it is so beautiful .
so , new container will soon be erected in the washing road .
but only with flats it is not done .
pro@@ spect is the cat@@ ch@@ word , are Reg@@ ine customer and An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le ein@@ ig .
in addition to a firm stay there are internship plac@@ ements , training places , training places , one @-@ euro jobs and assistance services for refugees and migrants who have to be folded or furnished .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reports Reg@@ ine customer .
many work in the building yard or help house@@ work , do @-@ profit work - and that motiv@@ ates and very tidy , like An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
she hopes the work for the community leads to a positive influence .
this is &quot; no employment therapy . &quot;
activity , however , does not mean work .
the day has a fixed structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer .
humans would need to develop an influ@@ enza experience .
so there are offers such as sports , contacts with locals and especially language courses .
professional courses are rare .
so we also jump on managing and volunteer .
it is central that the refugees feel the feeling they are welcome in Germany and welcome .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they must explain the refugees that it just takes and they can bridge it sensible , for example with language courses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wh@@ osoever would like the feeling of evolution , he could not help anyone in Ur@@ bach , but should not work and be un@@ profitable , he will never integrate himself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the clear majority is motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; problem cases is also , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says customer honest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; People who do nothing at all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is always willing to motiv@@ ate others . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s all a &quot; mamm@@ oth task . &quot;
a difficult question : have the two of the most recent inci@@ dents afraid of radic@@ alization , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , Reg@@ ine says quite clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What man@@ cher may call nai@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but a risk of dying could not ban it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensitive .
these inci@@ dents are subject to the refugees .
they would have the fear that the attacks bring them completely in demand .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer .
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so we must watch main and volunteer work locally and in the region &apos;s activities .
in fact , they are always in the background that soon a new push of refugees and migrants could come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a upper limit ?
this question seems to answer , sh@@ akes up politics .
actually , it is un@@ fair to place hel@@ pers on site .
&quot; we haven &apos;t arrived in Ur@@ bach , where we would go , &quot; says An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
no new refugees , that would be able to relax .
Reg@@ ine customer also makes it clear that the Ur@@ bacher can already be reli@@ eved even so that the previous people are r@@ ational .
these are currently 100 persons , mainly young men .
but when people are in need , they should help them , both women are lonely .
the political world situation is so complicated , there is no simple answers .
chim@@ dorf : in@@ crimin@@ als searched with helicop@@ ters

eventually the unknown in fact fell near the apartment and during their escape .
