<seg id="1">Golfer Langer receives the sports pyramid</seg>
<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the end of a golf course in South Africa, Bernhard Langer was looking for a little variety with a ride on the beach.</seg>
<seg id="4">For the 58-year-old it was a premiere.</seg>
<seg id="5">CHIO: "golden sports pyramid" for Bernhard Langer</seg>
<seg id="6">After a couple of minutes the horses remember their holiday, they pursued after his speeches in the quick gallop.</seg>
<seg id="7">One kilometer at this pace, I was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="8">"it was not a good experience," Langer says.</seg>
<seg id="9">And thus the equestrian arries ended again.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Saturday the best golfer in all times - 101 tournament victories - was again close to horses.</seg>
<seg id="11">He left his family over the plant of the ALRV, on a horse he did not go for photo purposes.</seg>
<seg id="12">It was the first time in Aachen and thus also at CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German sports aid was handed over to the man from Anhausen in a small gala to the Golden Sports pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="15">In awards, the sympathetic athlete is not lacking.</seg>
<seg id="16">Bundesaccursed Cross, Silver Lorbeerblatt, Champions-Tour-Player of the year...</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British Queen has already sacked him.</seg>
<seg id="18">Long is the 18th prize winners of the sports pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Aachen he met the first winner of Hans GÃ¼nter Winkler on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="20">"this award is very much," says Langer, "because she is not only awarded for sportive successes but also for social commitment."</seg>
<seg id="21">For decades, Langer promotes the offspring.</seg>
<seg id="22">And so he continued the prize money of 25.000 Euro.</seg>
<seg id="23">With 15 other outstanding athletes, the two-time US master winner was inducted on Saturday in the "Hall of Fame of German Sports."</seg>
<seg id="24">Among the excellent includes the athletes of Hartwig Gaudi and Harald Schmitt, the fairies Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the odoka Frank Wieneke, the Erecite Alwin Schockemerle and posthumously the Handballer Erhard Wonderful.</seg>
<seg id="25">Many of these sportsmen came to Aachen on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="26">After the official part, the illustrative society wandered into the springtime, where the Lavazza prize was running.</seg>

<seg id="1">Clintons and Trumps Economic Policy Comparison: it's All about the Money</seg>
<seg id="2">Invest in infrastructure and prevent the TTP trade agreement - both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the two US presidential seekers are, however, in the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental question.</seg>
<seg id="4">The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is based on a basic, rather philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">The role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to keep in doubt rather small and warns against the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulators.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wants to regulate and regulate the economy and regulate death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">He himself would be completely different, asserts Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">He will advance regulators massively, and he advocates a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private persons and for companies.</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton said: the state has certain tasks to fulfil, he has disadvantaged opportunities to open, and needs money for it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Therefore, taxes for the rich would be increased, they say.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the nuts invests, Trump and Clinton say almost to the same.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programmes in the infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are rejected by the government-critical Teisy-wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">So, on Trump, there could be still a partisan discussion.</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policies are more clearly.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal power plants and rebuild the coal mining in the US.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil extraction should also be possible in so far protected territories that he wants to cancel the Paris Climate Agreement.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "Clinton with their investment programme explicitly wants to expand and demands renewable energies with their investment programme:" "" "a country will create the super power of clean energies and create millions of jobs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements the two competitors are not too far from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transpazifish trade agreement, both do not want to sign.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "" "" "at the same time, both do not want to isolate international trade from international trade, but simply use American jobs." ""</seg>
<seg id="25">They should then be paid better, some Clinton calls for.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7,25 U.S. dollar is a hunger rewarding.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump wants to do in this question is not clear: once, he says: the minimum wage does not have to be changed, then he says he will not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the coming months is likely to develop the control policy of both camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "" "" "on one hand, Trump, who wants to discharge the economy and its citizens to boost growth." ""</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics keep him before, so that the budget deficit would only grow bigger.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton wants to ask at least from the rich they want to pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution.</seg>

<seg id="3">When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.</seg>

<seg id="30">Who believe that, as soon as they anchor in Germany, Bahr relates.</seg>
<seg id="31">Here too many women in refugee camps would often be regarded as inferior and worst.</seg>
<seg id="32">This leads to some 90 percent of women who live in the north of Munich, traumatised, estimates them.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "Alliance of Foreign Policy"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "" "" "the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to surrender hands and proclaim an official end of the eight month's war of words and economic sanctions." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish opponent in the gold-gilded hall of the St. Petersburg Palastes reception, I cannot stop myself from the trusting that Ankara doesn't want to reject this reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the envelope, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smile worked dirty, and he hardly radiate warmth, even for his restrained conditions.</seg>
<seg id="7">However, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke about his "dear friend" Putin - according to a report all five times.</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis but even to improve.</seg>
<seg id="10">On the next day, a paper describing Erdogan would have happened that it would never happen something bad.</seg>
<seg id="11">But his enthusiasm seemed to me the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin had a beaming, sustainable cooling showed that Russia's government had forgotten nothing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first to mentioned in his introductory words: the shooting of a Russian fighter aircraft at the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was horrified.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin shared out and accused Ankara to be in the back.</seg>
<seg id="16">Leaving it even bigger, since it was committed by an alleged friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">The coughing rebuild is difficult, if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">The public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "for months, the nationally controlled media carried a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">Suddenly it seemed like the Turks would carry all the guilt.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "the accusations of senior officials were that Earth's own family benefited from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria, controlled by the so-called Islamic State." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">He denied this vehement.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse from President Erdogan as he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the benefits of an armistice are obvious.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan is primarily necessary all friends who he can get after last month during a failed coup d "Ã©tat of almost his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terror attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - particularly the ban of charter flights which usually bring multiple millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has declined by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, travel operators and charter companies will be facilitated if the flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They are counting on an unisonaisonous onslaught of the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week the state television predicted fruit and vegetables as soon as Turkish agriculture imports are allowed again.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "a report in Vedemosti formulated it as follows:" "" "tourists stay there long, tomatoes here long." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is angry at the West, as it was a response to the attempted seizure of power as a weak answer.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "in addition, the prolonged Groll of EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pike is to take advantage of the cool mood and reduce the relationship between Turkey to the West." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian head of government won in Ankara with security to give a bonus for the attempted coup d "Ã©tat of the elected state organe.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is a self-understanding for Moscow, who has changed a deep-sitting fear of regimes itself.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "the summit meeting in this glittering palace in the sea enabled Russia and Turkey, one as described as an analyst," "" "Alliance of Foreign Affairs" "" ": two countries that overthrew themselves from the West and are now banned." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two still.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "" "" "the largest difference is Syria, where Moscow has recently issued the role as a peace maker, but Russia and Turkey." ""</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "" "" "it could be indicative that after almost three hours of first conversations, both presidents say on the press conference that they had not even striped the issue." ""</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the President of Turkey deliberately discards answer to a question about their differences while Putin decided to emphasise this." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus about where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>

<seg id="2">Dettori sprays champagne after a double at Newmarket, which brings him 3.000,000 gain</seg>
<seg id="3">At Friday, the Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3.000th British win at Newmarket on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="4">He set on Predilection which is trained by John Gosden, on his local race track with his second win of the night a milestone.</seg>
<seg id="5">The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth Jockey which reached the milestone in the flat race.</seg>
<seg id="6">He succeeds Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddry and Willie Carson.</seg>
<seg id="7">The three-day winner Dettori, who had won on Ghayyar, said, "It is something special."</seg>
<seg id="8">I'm very emotional because my family is here too</seg>
<seg id="9">I am very happy that it will happen at Newmarket because I landed here 30 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="10">It's not a big meeting, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a banquet Friday evening with 20.000 people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I am relieved and very modest.</seg>
<seg id="12">Dettori taketh the Jul when he brings victory at Predilection</seg>
<seg id="13">Two Jockeys reached the milestone in obstacle race - Jockey Richard Johnson and the retired 20-time winner Sir Anthony McCoy who reached over 4,300 victories in a record-breaking career.</seg>
<seg id="14">Lester Piggott, the ninety Derbysieger had 4,493 career points</seg>
<seg id="15">Frankie is one of the best Jockey der Moderne and it's no surprise that he reaches this milestone, which only few reached before him.</seg>
<seg id="16">He has style and is strong, but it is his tactical intellect, who differs him from the other in the weight control room.</seg>
<seg id="17">He's fantastic ambassadors for race, enthusiasm and charisma for years already for this sport.</seg>
<seg id="18">I said Frankie a couple of weeks ago at Epsom, that he had already scored 6,000 prizes if he was not only a weekend and big turnibjockey!</seg>
<seg id="19">Frankie has already suffered almost 30 years of winners, which is great.</seg>
<seg id="20">He has a vivid personality, which is good for a British race, but beyond that he is an incredible jockey.</seg>
<seg id="21">Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dismount</seg>
<seg id="22">From Flying Finishes to Flying Dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the figurehead of the British flat-floor for two decades.</seg>
<seg id="23">It was annoying.</seg>
<seg id="24">A whole series of major tournaments, including his famous "glorious seven" 1996 in Ascot, but he also survived a plane crash and received a drug prohibition.</seg>
<seg id="25">Three years ago he had in the beginning of trouble when he returned from his six months lock, but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to withstand his branches and to return to its top shape.</seg>
<seg id="26">And he is still not at the end - Dettori has said before, that he wants to continue his at least 50,ten years before competitions.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia's Putin fired up Chief of Staff Sergey Ivanov</seg>
<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin has relieved his Chief of Staff Sergey Ivanov.</seg>
<seg id="3">IVANOV was part of Putin's close confidentiality collection.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old was appointed Special Representative for Environmental and Transport.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "in an opinion of the Kremlin, it is that Putin have ordered the dismissal Ivanovs of his duties as chairman of the Russian President." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who had been the deputy commander since 2012, was appointed to his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the renowned Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in Tokyo's Embassy in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the site of the Kremlin it is called (in Russian) that he later became log head and Chief of heads of the government.</seg>
<seg id="10">He said to Putin about his appointment: "thank you for your trust."</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as head of heads for legislation and controls on implementation of your instructions." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov asked to leave his position and encouraged Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Convince the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This stage took place in Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="15">SergeIvanov was a long time one of the closest assurance of Vladimir Putin and works as he worked for the Soviet secret services, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin that was broadcasted on TV, both men asserted that the Chief of Staff went back on his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smile for the cameras, only a few of them are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So, is the result of a sort of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody currently knows.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official claim - that a man, who was called as a potential president once, wants to lead the Russian environmental policy - pushed forward to great skepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "in his remarks on Putin that are quoted on the site of the Kremlin, Ivanov said," "" "It is true that I asked you in a conversation with me this very complicated item - you might almost say - complying for four years." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian President for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV received the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">He was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin former member of the KGB State Security Service.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Military Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed Deputy Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin met the power, he called Ivanov as one of five people he trusted most.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once it was assumed that Ivanov could become a second term president of Russia as a third term of putting Putin against the constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another, close allies of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister, before he became President for three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="17">This was a massive and very finicky activity.</seg>

<seg id="1">PokÃ©mon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that pays off</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to watch how the world is changing.</seg>
<seg id="3">That teenager and child will not go out without any longer, but rather they prefer to spend their free time on screens, was complained in the last decade of many.</seg>
<seg id="4">With Pokemon Go, it's about getting people from the sofa and become more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time at the screen was on TV, then video games and most recently limited to smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">Therefore, it is great to see that technology and activities do not exclude each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">I am referring to the PokÃ©mon Go-Wahn, an app based on characters that were initially created for the video games in the 1990s (later it created a cartoon series, maps and other spin-off).</seg>
<seg id="8">How many phenomena of pop culture sank the interest in the release of the game in the US, Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was shifted by massive demand that overloaded the server.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days, PokÃ©mon Go more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, players with their smart phones go outside and looking for PokÃ©mons, who are followed with a GPS and once they have been found, "taken" (about a screenshot on the phone) or "captured."</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the wreck and jumped for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "in the U.S., the game led to a sizable increase in steps which the" "" "average" "" "person put back every day." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, followed by a app for Apple Watch, announced the Washington Post recently, that within two days after the launch of the game, the number of people followed by 45 per cent, who jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays PokÃ©mon Go - only the raw data for improving performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "many public awareness campaigns for health, people want to take" "" "walk from the sofa" "" "during 30 minutes" "" "and" "" "every day actively to be active" "", "because many public messages are boring for health and coming from people coming to look." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be overrated.</seg>
<seg id="19">Those who regularly do sports, reduces his chances of developing cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps with weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to take them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful on PokÃ©mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors, making them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Three pillars of health covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine and have fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even close new friends on the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always, there are also oral struggles, which must always complain about anything.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could walk against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What's it supposed to do?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if smart apps like Fitbit earlier were able to track our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to play sports as it does.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and the use is redone with the time.</seg>
<seg id="30">Because of poker success, however, there will be more games that will unite Apps and virtual reality with the active in the real world and help many people in hunting, more active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="17">There was a final exam in Brazil, a competition, which went not so much between Biles and the Rest of the Athletes, but rather between her and a burden of oversized expectations.</seg>

<seg id="21">Although Biles insisted on the top, never intended to have the future planned, this is not really true.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">This is what I propose to me among women's Olympics in the Turning Tower, and that is more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First, I have been part in every summer Olympics in 1984 and the USA had never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And second: this team has three turnerves, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, that inspired many young girls of other skin color.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jewess is and Madison Kocian who is Catholickin, makes everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the US.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years the number one under female Turnerves was an Afro-American woman.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year, Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2 were married.</seg>
<seg id="10">That shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the last Olympic Games Gabby Douglas was a surprising victory in the Olympic and America jubilee.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three times world championships in Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they were unexpected, yet masterful Gymastikroutines delivered.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday, Simone was the fourth, heterosexual Americans that won with an individual surplus event for women gold.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won Silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We are witnessing the top of this sport, but you don't see gym classes all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie struck all the same way as Aly and Madison, to create it into the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "they are the" "" "Last Five," "" "because the next Olympic champion is only four gymnastics in the team. besides, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">But reality looks like that turnes is an expensive sport and gymnasts in the first line in private gym that will maintain by parents, which will be maintained for training, furnishing and hotel costs (for the trainers and their Turner and families). the list can be rendered arbitrarily.</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these trainers lie in wealthy suburbs, which can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs the gymnasts of their whole training and that is for families an expensive and long-term commitment.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, have trained both their athletes and since they started with Turning.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to be inspired by the congregations of Aun countless, young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, a better and easily accessible gyms.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my gym of 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">With my events we have offered free and affordable Turning in Harlem for about 15,000 sturanteens (especially black and hispanic) and exercised national and international victors.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my home town) to offer the young high quality Turning to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Turning develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determinateness for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers lifetime advantages for health and training and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It's the inspiration of this team that bring thousands of young girls to be interested in the turnes and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to take part in sports, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">That is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real portrayal of "Girl Power" through the Holen of the Olympic team golds and thank you who motivate so many young girls with different background to start their way, healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="1">Travel Ian Wright shuts out his tongue to the dirty places of Europe</seg>
<seg id="2">A British traveller undertook his immune system and WÃ¼rgereflex - by taking some of the most dirty and most vulnerable places of Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The moderator and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk shot his course on a euro shot, a banker at Piccadilly Circus, a washing machine in Russia to put the resilience of its immune system under proof.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before the leaking of each object he used a Luminometer to show up and show us, on what he will let.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment that was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" brought some surprising results in daylight.</seg>
<seg id="6">The idea to block the scroll button of a train toilet, which was already used by thousands of others, may be completely revolting, but actually in a kitchen sink more bad bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria and its own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately, nothing left what he leaking, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright was known to test the resistance of its intestines by travelling through the world and ate wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public funds to train stations up to flush buttons of toilets, the task set his immune system definitely under a sample</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "he told me in the film:" "" "as a child, I was relatively inworried about my health and I have put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film, he was certainly just in his reputation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">Its promulch showed a Luminometry of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">In comparison with this, the number of freshly washed hands is less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet that he refused to wipe off after their Luminometres had over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands have one out of less than 60</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr Wright and the Finnish producer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the bacterial number of different places like the bathroom.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "in the film he says:" "" "this is what I smoked in a toilet, close." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing dirt than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I'm not going to sock here, because it is inside.</seg>
<seg id="21">The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength "was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company uses Mr Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the extraction of intestinal bacteria and the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">Valios Senior Venice President for Snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "we wanted to provide the consumer for a really new.</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the advantages of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We led crazy brainstorings through which we finished that we call "Lass us Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them into a bigger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "" "" "the growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and the documentary we could provide more information in an interesting way to consumers" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "Tom Hakala, who led the film of the film, added:" "" "let me say that I had lost my respect for Ian, if he had tasted some of the things I have instructed to lick him, like the ekelty Russian toilet that will be shown in the film." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course, there were things in which it was easier to put Ian to lick them and others, in which this was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "I'm glad we recorded some of these dirty leaks on film." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">In one of the conducted survey conducted by the year 2015, 84 per cent of all respondents in lactic acid bacteria were associated with the well-being of stomach and intestine and 58 percent, that at least occasionally products they contain the enclosed lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="3">With this, a surprising Cecilia Bartoli.</seg>
<seg id="4">A musical conquered Salzburg: the "West Side Story," Leornard Bernsteins masterpiece.</seg>
<seg id="5">The artistic director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of the classical music and filled with the role of Maria a youth nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the orchestra pit, the SimÃ³n BolÃ­var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel: "this music is full of rhythm," he warmed.</seg>
<seg id="7">We always say that it is very Latin American.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are many Latin American ingredients in their pace and melody.</seg>
<seg id="9">It's a wonderful mix, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="10">I would say that we really have Bernsteins music in our blood!</seg>
<seg id="11">In this staging, Bartoli plays a very older Lady.</seg>
<seg id="12">She remembers her love with Tony, while the younger daughter plays and dances.</seg>
<seg id="13">The role of Mary always fascinated me.</seg>

<seg id="2">Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals get nothing from the Summer Choice campaign - and the tourists from North Rhine-Westphalia don't have to choose the country day.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">The country code will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays, the sine parliament decided at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">Because it is not so far it won't be: summer holidays, heat and shagony combat - that bites itself.</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals, who are to be convinced by the Electors are on vacation.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most of the tourists who are in the country, on Usedom, RÃ¼gen, or Hiddensee are no natives, so you are not allowed to choose the country day.</seg>
<seg id="8">In addition, practical problems come: in the holidays they are helpers stating posters, inflating balloons, flyers, and use the end of the vote, to rub only weary.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until September 4, 2016, the electoral and final day of the day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has to abandon its presidential campaign almost over the people.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase, if one can't say anything at all, has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it's also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD / CDU coalition, must be afraid of his office.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, the strongest party, founded in 1998, is clearly behind the CDU.</seg>
<seg id="13">Exciting is how strong newcomer AFD cuts and what remains at the end of the coalition.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008, heads of government, makes an almost unobtrusive election campaign, one sees one of his posters.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels through the country, distributed roses and chatting a little with the people, as it did as well as his legend Harald Ringstorff.</seg>
<seg id="16">Otherwise, Seelering got cold feet and chancellor Merkel gives the fault at the bloom of the AFD.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "their refugee policy, you" "" "We create this" "" "accelerates the rise of the spelling team, which will probably cost him the beautiful post." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The CDU with its top candidate, the Minister of Interior, Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is when you make the wrong place for election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="19">She invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to press conferences twice; the German Chancellor Angela Merkel lies in the northeast.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the target group did not agree, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and Vorpommern.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "there was probably the majority of other federal states," "" "said Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, in NDR." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But it also failed to listen to anyone from other corners of Germany, to listen to Angela Merkel.</seg>
<seg id="23">Otherwise, the Nordost-CDU largely refrained on marketplaces and malls with umbrellas and balloons.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "this, coconut, plays only a" "" "minor role" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "" "" "the Union has noted that you are brothered on the land that it must be very strict, once again to find a wire to the people." ""</seg>
<seg id="26">As the left, the SPD, the Green Party, are barely there in the deserts of the country.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "however, the Council of the CDU-Shaters Kokert on his fellows is also self-exposed:" "" "they have to go there where people are: Dorffest, Golden Weddings, every birthday party must be exploited." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Because much on the game stands, Sellering has called his SPD as a particularly committed election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">In surveys, the S & D Group was finally defeated by 22 percent behind the CDU (25) and just before the AFD (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">In the election of 2011, the SPD was still clearly won by 35.6 percent in front of the CDU (22).</seg>
<seg id="31">The Greens, small party with seven percent in the polls, will be able to create the leap into the country day.</seg>
<seg id="32">They make a modern virtue from vacations and abandon their election campaign largely on the internet.</seg>
<seg id="33">"online election campaign" is the president Claudia MÃ¼ller.</seg>
<seg id="34">Otherwise, green leaves are embarking on domestic search for domestic voting among the tourists.</seg>
<seg id="35">Silke Gaek, the top candidatin, curved straight through a house boat through the mecklenburgian lakes and still finds it beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="36">Your impression: "electoral holidays in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is no penalty."</seg>

<seg id="2">On the speediness, with which the B 27 is rehabilitated, there is nothing to complain.</seg>
<seg id="3">For those responsible for the construction work, start at 5.30 a.m. and at 20 o'clock in the morning, there are all praise praise.</seg>
<seg id="4">"they did everything quite unchy," Elvira Tetzlaff tells of the jet fuel station.</seg>
<seg id="5">This is a super team.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is no default.</seg>
<seg id="7">The construction site could be moved to south until the end of October, everything should be completed by the end of October.</seg>
<seg id="8">The object is also praised to the construction work, for example when it comes to set up accommodation.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the construction site was moved to the south on Monday and also the lock of the AspergstraÃe in Ofandingen has been lifted and also the connection to Rottenburg is again relaxed, the road was relaxed within the resort.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "citizens can now drive back on both sides by Ofandingen." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">The evasive traffic by the place seems to go back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"there were some considerable problems," says the chief manager Florian King responsible for traffic-related management.</seg>
<seg id="13">The local residents of BachstraÃe, SteinlachstraÃe, HafnerstraÃe and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise because many Schleichways were looking for and rather to their Navi as the signage.</seg>
<seg id="14">What led to that some truck stops in residential areas.</seg>
<seg id="15">As the speed limit was not maintained, the parish called to amplify the measuring vehicle from MÃ¶ssingen.</seg>

<seg id="19">Since the construction site has been moved, it is still quieter.</seg>
<seg id="20">For business people at the B 27 it is just a small consolation that the road is now open to customers from Rottenburg.</seg>
<seg id="21">Business people don't like to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">But the B 27 Refurbishment has led to their sales revenue, everyone who asks them to look through.</seg>
<seg id="23">However some more and some are less affected.</seg>

<seg id="25">"" "also at the Autohaus Maier, Thomas Sulz talks about a" "" "most slight decline" "", "but also a fact that of course" "" "the runway is missing" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The most exploited are the local ones along the road.</seg>
<seg id="27">J. Albert GÃ¶hner, owner of the steakhouse, formerly crown, finds clear words.</seg>
<seg id="28">This is already existential.</seg>
<seg id="29">Not only him, but all the restaurants made it hard. "</seg>
<seg id="30">The customers were lacking in Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil.</seg>
<seg id="31">We will be happy to be over every euro.</seg>
<seg id="32">The sales tax amounted to "far above 50 percent."</seg>
<seg id="33">The street generation took his operation "by two years."</seg>
<seg id="34">He has to have dismissed the half of his staff.</seg>
<seg id="35">If I had a company with 4000 employees and half had been released, politics would have reacted differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, President JÃ¶rg Schmidt put on a request of GÃ¶hner if there might be a financial balancing act, with the reference, the restaurant benefits otherwise from the advantages of the location on the B 27. now they also have the downsides that carry on through the refurbishment.</seg>
<seg id="37">GÃ¶hner knows of other counties, where something more generous was handled.</seg>
<seg id="38">At all suits, GÃ¶hner is sure that his restaurant will pass on.</seg>
<seg id="39">After all, the family business has already been based here since 1715, he points to the long history.</seg>
<seg id="40">That other regular guests are now less often subject to the complex traffic guidance, it can understand.</seg>
<seg id="41">If you cannot go down, it's also somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="42">After the end of the renovation work, GÃ¶hner has no doubts about it.</seg>
<seg id="43">Despite the crises of BSE and a bird flu, GÃ¶hner holds the impact of the B 27 construction work on its clientele, which experienced his restaurant in its long-term history.</seg>
<seg id="44">Six months construction work, which is already brutal.</seg>

<seg id="22">In Dulence for expired asylum seekers, he wants to face some worse than so far - such as such, offences or their papers deliberately throw away their identity.</seg>
<seg id="23">A lot of it is political and legal.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some also still seems impores and makes questions open.</seg>
<seg id="25">And with some points - in the imitation of impatiated for example - the question arises: what does this actually have to do with safety and terror?</seg>
<seg id="26">Yes, de MaiziÃ¨re says it is important to differentiate between the topics of refugees and terror.</seg>
<seg id="27">But it cannot be said in disagreements that the attacks were refugees from Ansbach and WÃ¼rzburg.</seg>
<seg id="28">In addition, many people accounted for security in view of the high number of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="29">And things that deeply depressed people, were now unable to cling to constitures times.</seg>

<seg id="2">Lonely men love middle-age panels.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you rush to comment, in order to oversee him under the pseudonym of non-alleginal men with rough insults, this statement is derived from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the most important re-emergence of records does not want to have a boom in millennials, who want to greet the novelty of physical objects, but attributed to Midlife nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">For those who recently bought a record, all previews are between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most likely buyer group.</seg>
<seg id="7">There is also no hordes by Hobbysammers - it has an emotional meaning: older platesmen always retain their feelings for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it to spend time alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But are the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "if this blog would be a news report on TV, I would like to follow the camera, whilst in a busy street in Soho run, a modest grey suit and wild gestuliers before I keep to stop my hands and need something to be such as:" "" "so let's throw a closer look at it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="10">So let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even if the heart takes up slowly at his charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where once-independent sellers were located - there are still a handful of fantastic record stores.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman, to switch the camera for the next part, where I get in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind by observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I say by Sister Ray (data number: two young women, three men middle age) into Reckless Records (data number: eight males intermediate age, a woman, probably around the 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I wonder?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess it," he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3.000 or 4.000 plates.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "these records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I'm not following him), dress the walls of his living room." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles, is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records that he could not afford to buy stuff when he was recently sold, when he was young and broke.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "many things I buy, are out of the late 60s, early 70s, who was released when I was 11 or 12. things that I was probably too young to buy them," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "he agrees to those who are buying records, rather introverted, and would like to spend time alone, and adds:" "" "I don't smoke and I don't drink much." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my disaster.</seg>
<seg id="22">NEXT, 25 who works at Sister Ray also believes that many customers that he meets to the Yougov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">He has also noticed a new wave of people who have influenced by the media, people who have heard about the comeback and get to buy their old records.</seg>
<seg id="24">Of the conversations I have led, people are usually so around 1998 or 1999 of their collection.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs, now sell their CDs to buy their CDs again, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">That would explain the boom of trailers of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a shop like Phonica to recognize that record stores a soothing community of equality.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to WEZ, some of the older customers participated in the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans feel overcome by the digital world and would like to retreat into the stability of familiar sound plate, of objects, the happy jugenders.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be the colt of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort," says GMT.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is with me as collectors and I think it is so many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like their social worker!" "" "a staff from a flat stack." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey conducted by ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of people who have purchased a record last month they have not listened.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found that 41% had a turntable that they never use, while 7% for those who buy one record, do not have any turntables.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report I would probably look very worried, while I leaflets to the Bossa Nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works at sounds of the Universe (data number: three men middle age) has noticed a "trophy" of the Revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone just came here recently and said," I sit no turntable, but I would like to buy a radio record that I can put it into the shelf, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a large percentage, but it is definitely going to happen.</seg>
<seg id="41">More productive, less music.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I have no turntable."</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older, who only come slowly.</seg>
<seg id="44">Opp, which has almost a whole floor dedicated to the records, has an underground audience than I go.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around 70, tourists who make photos, teenagers and women middle ages.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even though the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops, Wild Beasts's latest synthesizers and sexbepackers pop from the loudspeakers - is it good to see such diversity among customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks very lonely, but nagging psychic traumata are hard to detectable, when one stands next to somebody for 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been running around since a couple of minutes and look at the variety of plates available for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It rather makes a window boom as a big purchase.</seg>
<seg id="50">It doesn't deserved a lot, therefore, collecting records no real option, says it.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs much.</seg>
<seg id="52">It's easy to listen to music from a computer or in another way, but the beauty of records is... "it drives with a loved sightezer.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business, which is said to have inspired by a new generation of record lovers: urban outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I give the appearance of the jeans hotspots, I observe a group of young teenage girls who groups to group a moment around Polaroid cameras before making a father and his daughter to buy a Crosley record player.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left is a staircase, a wall full plates of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential records for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">Nobody looks at it - perhaps because they are only pure decorative, some as far above that it is impossible to touch them.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that any attraction for these items mean more money for the industry, and some customers in the depths of Sohos could be sent for more, there is nothing to complain.</seg>
<seg id="60">"" "" "" "it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others, even the one that is most important for luxury objects such as records." ""</seg>
<seg id="61">Even if my research shows that the results of YouGov vote, they leave, at least in record shops in Soho, the great number of female collectors and record lovers that exist in reality, record shops and Onlineforen.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people are probably working hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They spend their Thursday morning with security not with the strolling through turntables of Berwick Street and the leaves by plates, while starving the face of an uncanny, 30-year-old false presenter who stands out over the shoulders no crazy men aged over the shoulders.</seg>

<seg id="2">The impressive performance of Great Britain in the 7-year rugby came to a abrupt stop at the last hurdle in the form of Fijis, when they were defeated by 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji divided a master class in handling, Side-Stepping, Afterwards, Line and raw power to win gold - its first Olympic medal in each color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was missed by the not too bad trophy of the silver medal - Britain's fourth one in that day - and they were able to be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they struck New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day could fall to them in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But irrespective of this, Fiji had been defeated a 15-man team in top form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It might be a consolation for GB - but it will probably not - that at least one Brit tomorrow will have a gold medal around his neck: Fijis head coach Ben Ryan, the former head for England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path behind him.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago, they have lost every game with Ryan Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they just lost one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This cap will hurt, but progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji began to be wonderful and did the attacks of GBs of fun off.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for the captain Tom Mitchell to and Co. at, when one would walk in driving buses. the World Series winner went upwards from 5-0 to the top, as the Osea Kolinisau moved in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With another four minutes of playing, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner that he walked.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB hardly took the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">An hegearing Tin of Mitchell stopped the mountain of Man Leone Nakarawa a third goal, but Fiji had just stopped.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute Jasa Veremalua lete a touch down in the right corner and it stood 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new since the re-release and there was still a minute time playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou prefake through further weak Tacklings of the GB teams and stormed up to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion had a 29-0 to the break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is as if Fiji had been born to play the 7, while the GB are still practised.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB introduced basic changes to half-time by and closed the fijian gap... for all four minutes, which was good for the ratios of the first half, until Joshua passed through a brilliant interplay of Fiji by Joshua.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touch down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game went long in favor of the south of SWA, whose fans sang, flags pushed and danced on the tribune.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not hard to admire the playful approach of Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame put the i bag with another try in the last seconds.</seg>

<seg id="3">From the first strokes to the last, 220 hard Hieve, who meet in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning had an additional meaning in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even if there were only the Beiters who sat at the Ruder, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the trainers Robin Williams was present when she was in a row with no tax lady in a row, the first women in the history of British sport, who used such a scale.</seg>
<seg id="5">Her domination was absolute, after all her 39,ter handler, which also is unparalleled.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant athlets that glide over the surface with the elegance of siles, which is not reflected in the nature of the Triumphal Arch.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind each gold in the rowing there is a battalion to content helpers that make the difference and it was no more convenient than the trainer, who would not survive this day, as if he was diagnosed with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said he risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had sterorectal cancer, which is operable and did they do.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you don't do it, it spreads out everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been quite a bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a little the outlook.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio were lucky that he could start the beginning of 2014, outside the season, in case the break was on a minimum, if such circumstances is the correct term.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I had to go better again soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in the hospital and ran on the station around - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">The rowing on itself is a challenge, but that makes it even greater.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the inmedioability of victory, their first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nervening morning to talk more than usual, trying to process his own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "stanning that was the centurion at the Royal Artillery regiment in a deployment in Afghanistan," "" "I was this week an emotional wreck. that is perhaps something extreme, but it means so much." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">It is only repeating how much I mean, how much I and Helen and Robin worked with Robin.</seg>
<seg id="23">It was three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin we would be no one, therefore a massive thank you to him. he is the best trainer in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">I could not wish for a better person or a better trainer.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning lost no race in the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm, with which their opponents could not keep up.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even in the last 500 metres, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark had to start up, Stanning and Glover had a lot in reserve.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were caught very at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">Helen called "stay in the process, stay in the process."</seg>
<seg id="31">It's really important to let not get involved.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we were not looking forward to doing something.</seg>
<seg id="33">We wanted no fireworks today, we just wanted to achieve a good result, going out and win the race, what we did.</seg>
<seg id="34">The couple will take for one year before making decisions about his future.</seg>

<seg id="1">Community, mind, health: sing seniors good</seg>
<seg id="2">The singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp all her life: as young girl she was in the school choir, she reserved the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a Senior Citizen choir.</seg>
<seg id="3">"sing me - emotional and physically," she describes.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a rehearsal they feel balanced, cheerful and a total of living, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">By the way, she does something good in her health and mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">Because singing is a great hobby for seniors, says Erhard Hackler from the German senior league.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most seniors sing in chorus and sharing with equations the joy of music, Hackler describes.</seg>
<seg id="8">By regular cohesion, seniors may establish and maintain social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because often social and family structures in the age, a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "this experience also made Ursel Kipp's in her choir:" "" "to speak and organize to the others and learn from each other - a chorus is a very special form of combining together." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be stressful in the positive sense, Hackles means.</seg>
<seg id="12">Elderly are a deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Who calls his lungs regularly, is not so fast out of the purest in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even if it comes to preserve the sound of the voice in age, singing is an optimal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">For older people, singing often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz, from the Federal Labour Community of seniors.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations, the common singing had a much higher priority, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and in leisure, she explains.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz frequently observed that singing or listening of songs in elderly people have aroused many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.</seg>
<seg id="18">Lyrics and especially melodies exhordes themselves in the diseased events of long-lying events.</seg>
<seg id="19">When singing, a special performance is required when singing, Lenz explains.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, focus on his own voice and on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers, this is a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Just older people who live alone, practice this way, not only to concentrate on yourself.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition that one drives through the singing in chorus, Hackler thinks.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">Even the self-esteem is growing by singing in a chorus.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show yourself: if I have long for something, I'll get better and watch over me - this experience strengthens.</seg>
<seg id="26">Good reasons to start singing with singing, so there is enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">Who wants to try a new hobby, should not hesitate - even if he means a little talent, Lenz shows.</seg>
<seg id="28">You don't sing alone - with 50 sinful people, who's already listening to it when a sound is next to it?</seg>
<seg id="29">In search of a suitable offer, Seniors say different ways, Hackles says.</seg>
<seg id="30">If someone sings among the memory in an old bosom, you can easily join.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer views of the choirs in the surroundings.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in a church choir can direct itself directly to the church or the church.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">Anyone who has no access to the Internet, ask the family, friends or neighbours for help with the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="35">Who wants to sing, should definitely join a chorus, Hackles advises.</seg>
<seg id="36">Sing the soul well and has something effective - this is true for every age.</seg>

<seg id="2">One day after they shot three goals, during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the American field hockeyteam of women in a match on Thursday around India that the Americans won with 3-0.</seg>
<seg id="3">Five gates in two games should actually represent a memorable effort, but Bam (27) said it could not remember that ever done.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I have no idea." she said.</seg>
<seg id="5">I don't belong to the people who keep their goals in mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, they know: the Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic Contests and are even in their group with the Britons on the first place, who remain undefeated after their 2-0 victory against Japan.</seg>
<seg id="7">Great Britain and the United States will hit twice on Saturday in the last round of the first round.</seg>
<seg id="8">Both teams have already qualified for the quarter-final, the game will decide which the two will reach the first and second place within their group of six teams.</seg>
<seg id="9">The first place will take a bit longer from the path that will lead the other group.</seg>
<seg id="10">As always the game may go out on Saturday, Americans have triggered a surprising host through their success story, four years after they landed in the last London games on the last of 12 squares.</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time with three years a hockey team in hands (their two older sisters played the sport at the Drexel University), with 16 years she became the national player of the USA, the youngest in the history of this team.</seg>
<seg id="13">They missed the Olympics in 2008 because it was not able to qualify for the cadres.</seg>

<seg id="1">Amid the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of Trampolins</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, how late it is, the Olympic Games are.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events of Rio de Janeiro feel constant and inevitable, a rapid relay between competition and pursuit.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is like the Olympic torch even a burning rod, who is enough to protect the Turner to the triathletes.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can not switch to the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbors during the queue in the Coffeshop queue, without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Lecovery or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who is for the first time during the Olympic Games and a women's swarm with dimples, could have been well received under these known names, which would be sent to Prime Time by sponsors and welfare-TV advertising, if he would be a swimmers, Turner or even feeders.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fighting in the Olympic trampoline for gold.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame is not illuminating every event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the centre, partly in the shade are the sports, which are not generally recognised: aerial shoot, archery, badminton, taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breast swim and may reign for long.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I might make a modest arguments for my particular darling, let me guide the attention on the discrete charm of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the tramp had already been an Olympic event since 2000, when it was in Sydney it was noticed that many of them that I had asked, did not know that it is even a Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="14">That could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the USA sent athletes to the competition, there has never been a medal in the trampoline and had a athlete until 2012, which has made it to the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadian who for women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennon from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">Jumping on the trampoline has a certain outer edge charme, partly because it sounds for a Clownsschule for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a better enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has a humorous potential - the cartoonous tremor of his never wanted uplifting - but also the Grazie of gymnastness and diving, the two sports which essentially combines it.</seg>
<seg id="21">The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means so much means "springboard."</seg>
<seg id="22">Emerging victors jump on a giant trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have a number of falling movements (turning, heels and sage) before they land at the feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">They will be evaluated according to the official Olympiaprogram for execution, difficulty and "flight time."</seg>
<seg id="24">Eighty athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio each other.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists must continue in their quest for gold, faster, upward and upward, sometimes up to the target, sometimes go and back, up and down on the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They do not only hunt the finish line or the cursor, but also in the TV broadcast a further polite goal: the world or the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="28">The targeted striving is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it's enough to even stir up a spectator.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it's also what I feel like trying to watch out of these games as something.</seg>
<seg id="30">This trampoline offers an attraction.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is located above.</seg>
<seg id="32">The forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she pruned, seemingly heavy like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back upwards.</seg>
<seg id="34">There is also a contest, of course not without difficulty, but while exercising there is no hectic attack on the goal, no vault in the distance, only the dreaming, elegant clearing of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is so Zen as the competition in the Olympic Games can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualifying and final customers will take place on Friday afternoon by 13.00 Eastern Time; the male on Saturday, also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will exude the bottom hour as part of a afternoon block at 14.00 on two days.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the midst of the Olympia-Manie, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to oversee in general tumult.</seg>
<seg id="39">When the consciousness of consciousness can only be achieved through the attitudes and the object of male athletes, according to The Wall Street Journal revealed recently - Mr. Dooley anticipates his flying, new fan base.</seg>

<seg id="1">"a generation of protesting" in Ethiopia, Long a partnership in the USA</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protest in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Demonstrators, the political changes in Ethiopia are demanding to violent resistance of the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that zig of Protestants were killed during clashes with the police.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just going to collapse?</seg>
<seg id="6">In the past ten years it was one of the wealthier countries in Africa, a solid association with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in the last few months, protests against the government has shaken the country and widespread in more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week, thousands of people stacked on roads and required fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The government's response was unmerciful according to human rights organizations.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses declared that policemen were shot and killed in unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">In circulation, videos on protests, probably from the last or early of this year, show how security leaders are showing young people with sticks, while they were forced to make a hand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN Committee on Human Rights now demands an incoming investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it has always been difficult to hold this country, and in future, it will become even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country of Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and secret services work closely with the Ethiopians, to fight terrorist attacks on the region, especially in Somalia. only few countries in Africa, if at all, get so much western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopians economy expanded in considerable tempo.</seg>
<seg id="17">His infrastructure drastically improved - there is a new pendulum in the capital Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">Streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have constantly led the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted, dissidents have been effective to silence.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent to exile or prison, sent to the deserts of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "if you suppress people and they do not have any other options except to protest, it breaks out," "" "said Seyoum Teshome, a teacher in the Ethiopian Ethiopian." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">All youth protested.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation of protesting.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "" "" "there are numerous complaints that cover all from the ground up to worms in relation to power of ruling coalition." ""</seg>
<seg id="26">After an extensive election last year, the ruling party and its allies were given the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, tensions rise along the border to Eritrea; a struggle for this controversial, controversial line required in June hundreds of lives.</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "" "" "analyst fear that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, which were more or less forced in recent years, would use the turbulence and arm themselves again." ""</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of provocation after years of abuse has now explode under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years, many Ethiopians were able to communicate with social media, since cheap smartphones were always more common and improved the Internet services.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government has access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do in regular intervals, especially at protests, do many people still communicate more about Internet Proxies that hide where they stop.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians gave the fact that they were so close to protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there are more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">Since eyees, Amharas, which come from Ãthopiens are mainly Christian highlands, in politics and business, while they exploited the Oromos, of which many Muslims are living and in lowlands.</seg>
<seg id="37">But this also changes.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are to coordinate under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="39">The largest protests were held in areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, which accounts for around 6 percent of the population and dominant in military service, in trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr Meles, a former rebel leader, was up to his death at a non-publicity illness in the year 2012 17 years of Ethiopia's prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could think of corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly disseminated in use early signs of dissatisfaction and to use SonderCommissioners to edit opponents and make them harmful.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the current regime is missing in this basic skill," "" "said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailleariam Desalegn, was chosen from relatively opaque reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Other than Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray Region North Ethiopians, is Lord Hailemariam from the South.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he enjoys not enjoying the confidence of the Tigray controlled safety services.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">"" "" "" "the last time Ethiopia had such a uproar in 2005, after thousands of elections protested by the government seemingly, according to information from analytics." ""</seg>
<seg id="51">During the following Razants many Protestants were killed, even though it were less than in the last few months and this time of disturbances went relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts lobten Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure plan, like the new penduller suit, as well as for its measurable progress in poverty reduction.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this does not prevent the intensification of the internal abuse of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And she takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month, Protesters attacked in Gondar, an amharic town, by Tigray, guided shops and hatred towards the Tigray is becoming increasingly exercised in social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that protests in the U.S. and other Western allies occur in a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The U.S. government used Ethiopia as a base for Dronenvion to neighbouring Somalia, even if they recently shared that it closed this base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West wants to support democracy, he doesn't want his ally to collapse in an already volatile area.</seg>
<seg id="59">"" "" "" "this, Mr Abdi said," "" "is a very thin tightrope." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains his assertion Obama was "sarcasm."</seg>

<seg id="6">But in an early morning tweet Mr. Trump said, he was just sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">Unlike the previous day, Tweet was contrary to Mr. Trump in a number of interviews he said the accusation was completely serious.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative Radiomoderator Hugh Hewitt wanted to weaken the statement, that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, wanted nothing to know the Republican Presidential candidate.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism drops down to Mr. Trump while he tried to focus on his campaign's focus due to falling cargo values to the economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton held speeches to the economic situation in Michigan, this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday Mr. Trump tried again to return to this topic.</seg>
<seg id="12">He warned on Twitter that Mrs. Clintons's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he had found their speech boring.</seg>

<seg id="14">"" "at the end of July he put strong criticism when he said, the Russians should get Mrs. Clintons" emails but later he declared "" "" Of course I said the sarcastic. "" "" "" "</seg>

<seg id="17">But I think he is smart enough to keep his testimony vague enough, so that they can be interpreted in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of defusing the sound for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has taken a still corrosive tone, because its cargo values have gone further.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey conducted by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Maris who was published on Friday, showed a guided tour with big lead in the states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump is trying to excuse for his provocative remarks, he often accused his critics to distort his testimonies or to understand his humour.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while he is focusing on the focus of attention in recent months of its presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps joke has brought his loyal companion to him, regardless of how provocative might have his remarks.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former Mayor of New York and one of Trumps most prominent advocates, has made great effort to defend the candidates in a CNN-interview from Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments" "" "said Mr. Giuliani so he was asked about the correctness of Mr. Trumps, whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State." ""</seg>

<seg id="25">Most mainstream republicans try to argue that the Obama administration, in Mrs. Clinton, served as an Secretary of State, has allowed to spread to spread the situation in the Middle East and under control.</seg>

<seg id="7">But if New York change is, it is also new.</seg>
<seg id="8">A revitalized verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.</seg>
<seg id="9">The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same employees and a similarly simple atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="10">The coffee is still good.</seg>
<seg id="11">The new owner of the Verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-standing employee of the old cafe, the owner and managing director of the new cafe.</seg>
<seg id="12">He began working in Verb in 2001 and remained there until the end.</seg>
<seg id="13">When a customer offered to provide money for a new outside, he was excited to do it, he said.</seg>

<seg id="16">It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.</seg>
<seg id="17">But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment.</seg>
<seg id="18">He introduced new ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="19">On the menu, sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are garages such as capers and autious onions.</seg>

<seg id="35">Rodriguez said he did not understand a denll that the soap business has taken the old business room.</seg>
<seg id="36">In fact, the owners of the Soap Cherie used to produce a special soap for verb with cold sprayed coffee of the coffee shop as an ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="37">"" "" "" "I think we will go down to her offering," "" "said Rodriguez." ""</seg>

<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">GrÃ¶nlandhaie usually come to the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to go back to the sea after an investigation on board ship Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and floats with a 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">GrÃ¶nlandhaie got only about 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Greenland airport swims down the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour he has an average of 1.220 meters.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it comes to it, the five meter long animal speeds on satin 2.6 km / h - and this top speed is half as fast as a Robbe.</seg>
<seg id="9">This one of long-term lifestyle seems to be a sponsor's concept for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" at any rate from a Greenland who could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"madness," commented Alexander Schattenlein from the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock, this lifespan which means for vertebrates a world record.</seg>
<seg id="12">Although the Evolutionbiologist already assumed that Greenland's stone may be petrified.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence failed.</seg>
<seg id="14">GrÃ¶nlandhaie are difficult to observe, eventually they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they are water-temperatures of the six degrees Celsius, they usually immerse them in the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">Scientists know very little about the lifestyle of Greenland.</seg>
<seg id="17">Her timepentempo measures it, when you cut six animals in front of Svalbard, with a broadcaster.</seg>
<seg id="18">However, these sharks make these sharks: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a Robbe, another had swallowed up the jaw bone of a young polar bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">You may chase them sleeping animals or patrol on the bottom of the ice cream and look for cadaver, which torch from higher water layers according to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues studied 28 Greenland and the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland and Svalbard as bycatch from the depth of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, whereas the largest 502 centimeters dimension.</seg>
<seg id="22">To determine the age of animals, they analyzed the carbon core of the sharks with the carbon-14 method.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of eye lens already arises in front of the birth of the sharks which contained proteins are no longer renewed.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had a much carbon-14 in the core core.</seg>
<seg id="25">Its birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons tests a large amount of this radioactive carbon in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the length of 220 cm length, the Linsencore contained a low surplus to carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons, so it should have celebrated its 50th birthday at its investigation in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">In contrast, all the larger Greenland varieties had normal carbon-14 amounts, which is created by cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14 clock showed an age of 335 years for a 493 centimeters long Greenland, while the record shark should be 392 years old even 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That GrÃ¶nlandhai-females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers were able to associate a age.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimeters were probably at the threshold of the sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years, GrÃ¶nlandhaie with the multiplication seems to be at least one and a half centuries.</seg>
<seg id="32">This should also be the world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methyl emes live above all in icy waters is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">Also the previous record holder, a 211-year old Greenland, in whose bacon on the neck was a 120-year-old harpoon top was captured on Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures, the organism of living animals living there often also live on sparrows.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and they slow down.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in cold water, the animals are often particularly large.</seg>
<seg id="38">For the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal keeps heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram is therefore much larger than in one gram elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: they have less enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "a smaller animal lives so dangerous and should concentrate on it as if possible to have as many descendants as possible," "" "explains the Evolutionary biologist Schadventlein as soon as possible." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">A very big animal should rather invest his resources in a long life.</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland's Callum Skinner's last evening in the Velodrom in the Velodrom in Rio to glory as the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23 year old from Glasgow took the lead role, who had made his fellow countryman Sir Chris Hoy to Eigen and made the legend haughty when he had stormed to home a victory of New Zealand's Favorite New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick, after arriving at the underground world championships in London, despite the return of Hoys only a modest sixth place.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time as execution.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retired to conclude a gap, the Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man when they stayed when they saw potential in the villi that unfolds now.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hinder, Kenny - those four years ago with Hoy victorious - and Skinner set up a Olympiord in the qualifying rounds, but the New Zealanders wins the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British Trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">After his turn, after his lap, Kenny brought the team up and Skinner held it.</seg>
<seg id="13">A strategy change made a great part of transformation that drove it to slow down in a higher gear to slow down it and allow to maintain the pace and above all Skinner.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy saw his position as BBC expert from his position and fell Skinner, Kenny and Hinder when they rose to the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "23 year old Skinner from Glasgow said:" "" "it's a flattering comparison." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just here to do my best and to make me a name.</seg>
<seg id="17">We set up a Olympiord in the Endrunde and conquered the world champion.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the triumph of 2012 on the side of Kennys and Hoys there were evidence that after a weak start, he deliberately fell to the track.</seg>
<seg id="21">He returned this statement later and there was no objection of England's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">This time there was no problem with such a victory.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "said:" "" "it feels with all the UK flags on the tribune like London." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">We have joined the team in the last three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">So far, we have come so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win at the Olympiad.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, which were won seven of 10 titles in Beijing and London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, expect us to expect a successful five days in Velodrom.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the shape of Kennys, it is in the field of possible that he repeated Hoys victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.</seg>
<seg id="29">That would be for Kenny - that was born exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (apparently most holy date for British sports; on the day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>
<seg id="30">This would be the same from Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny takes part in the Sprint, which starts today and will start over three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "the 28 year old of Bolton said:" "" "I enjoy this only for the moment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels quite lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "he said," "" "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be defeated to knights." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the only medalliative competition in the day, but there were more good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir BraqueWiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-hour race run.</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived in 3: 51,942.</seg>
<seg id="40">The world record that won in London in 2012 was 3: 51,659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will take place on the second day of the contest, at the Wiggins on security.</seg>
<seg id="42">He fought against qualifications before the qualification, when officials called to him to measure his body size.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the event of the women's competition, tomorrow continued and terminated, avancÃ© Laura Despens, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in world record time in 4: 13,260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The UK team relies on its strong railway team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a band of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly extraordinary representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio were shut down.</seg>
<seg id="46">"" "they played in the background" "" "Shane Sutton" "" "in the background, so the resignation of the technical director Shane Sutton in April in the midst of sexism and bulbingbacks as well as the retirement of sizes like Hoy and Victoria Pendleton." ""</seg>

<seg id="4">A subsidy for 20 years is going to be published in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 jobs in the plant of ALCOA in Portland are at stake.</seg>
<seg id="6">No less than 2000 jobs -direct and indirect - could be at risk of closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, it could cause domination of domino, because the melt some 10 per cent of the total power generation of Victorias.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014, ALCOA closed the Point of Henry melt, leading to the last year to a closure of the Anglesea force.</seg>
<seg id="9">The melt of ALCOA in Portland loses money and risked a closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">This step follows the longlasting speculation regarding the future of the complex, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and lastly due to the current price of the plant.</seg>
<seg id="11">AGL, which supplies the large aluminium melting plant with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, told that three other owners will announce their contracts.</seg>

<seg id="20">The US company said that 2010 has concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, who should have entered into force in 2010, even if it is still a statement, why it came back from the contract.</seg>
<seg id="21">In addition to the bad economic conditions of the industry, analysts believe in front of the possible closure of the Portland melting shop in Victoria and the Tomago facility near Newcastle.</seg>
<seg id="22">In reference to the analysts at the beginning of the week, Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland annually began around 600 megawatts and Tomago to power around 900 megawatts.</seg>

<seg id="2">E-Mail and the Internet in Timlupe: 20 years ago Nokia's Communicator came on the market.</seg>
<seg id="3">The successors now dominate the world - its manufacturers experienced a disaster.</seg>
<seg id="4">The equipment weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as difficult as an iPhone 5.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was thicker and bigger, so it was not good in the hand.</seg>
<seg id="6">On the contrary, it was quite knock.</seg>
<seg id="7">The built-in memory was at first eight Megabytes, which would suffice today for approximately two beatifies of high resolution.</seg>
<seg id="8">An iPhone now comes with at least 16 gigabytes.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "the" "" "Nokia 9000 Communicator" "" "came exactly 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996, into the shops, and it was the first smartphone." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">For a few euros lovers can buy the equipment on the Internet, but they come somehow from the time of the internet era.</seg>
<seg id="11">20 years ago, the Communicator was a sensation.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier on the computer trade fair Cebit in Hannover as "office in the Westerners format."</seg>
<seg id="13">In fact, the new mobile phone could be sent and received for that time standards a lot: SMS and e-mails could be sent and received via fax was the Communicator.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even the access to web pages was possible via HTML-browser, if also squeezing slowly.</seg>
<seg id="15">A pocket calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.</seg>
<seg id="16">There was a small antenna, and the mobile phone could be opened as a laptop.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then a small keyboard and a black-white screen took place.</seg>
<seg id="18">Quite proud was the price: 2700 D-Mark, i.e. approx. 1400 euros.</seg>
<seg id="19">The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="20">No one could notice in August 1996 that the Communicator would become the start of the smartphone era.</seg>
<seg id="21">Since then everything is different.</seg>
<seg id="22">Smart phones are a success story if not for Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Finns cell division experienced an unprecedented disaster that was finally sold to Microsoft and handled.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, the market governs the market which all came later than Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="25">Ever and anywhere online, this is today for a lot of people daily life.</seg>
<seg id="26">In 2015, there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="27">Around 1.4 billion units sold to Samsung and Apple were sold alone by 555 million units.</seg>
<seg id="28">Worldwide sales with the units are around 400 billion euros.</seg>
<seg id="29">To do this, the well-running business of the countless App providers and the telecommunications company are coming.</seg>
<seg id="30">A whole industry is created around the smartphone.</seg>
<seg id="31">The decisive breakthrough on the mass market came first in early 2007, then Apple CEO Steve Jobs on Mac-World announced the introduction of iPhones.</seg>
<seg id="32">He promised three devices in one: a music player, a telephone and an Internet communicator, easy to use via touch screen.</seg>
<seg id="33">The triumphal march of Apple began, today the iPhone is the most important product of the group.</seg>
<seg id="34">Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry, who ruled the market, had to see.</seg>
<seg id="35">Finally, they disappeared, Blackberry has to fight.</seg>
<seg id="36">Our days now have Apple and Asian suppliers such as Samsung.</seg>
<seg id="37">The smartphone is a self-understanding for 20 years after its invention.</seg>
<seg id="38">Today, in the meantime, each German has meanwhile met 88 times a day on his cell phone.</seg>
<seg id="39">"" "" "" "we all need to learn to put the smartphone even once," "" "said Janina Ball, responsible for the Siemens management board." ""</seg>

<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies, developed a model in order to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms, resemble from climate research.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine if the Venus could be upgraded with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have hinted that the slow revolution of the Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the newest simulation indicates that the Venus could have had a thin, erdless atmosphere and still slowly turned on.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also lighted the topography of early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet probably pointed out more dry areas than de Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to accommodate life and protected against evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation the slow revolution of the Venus exponates the slow revolution of the Sun for almost two months," said GISS scientists Anthony Del Genio in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This heat the surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer clouds that looks like a umbrella on the surface of most of the sun heat shielding.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result are average temperatures that are some degree cooler than the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model created a story of Venus that resembles evolution that was previously conceived by planetary research.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although it was presumably inhabitable, the Venus - in the course of over billions years --too much heat and ultraviolet light was exposed.</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans had evaporated and their water vapour were burnt away from ultraviolet light.</seg>

<seg id="1">Datklau: so perfide cre hacker their ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Programing malware programmers are currently attacking the targeted company - and are successfully involved.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey of the malware anti-defense specialists Malwarebytes under 540 companies in North America, UK and Germany, 40 percent of surveyed companies in the past twelve months were at least once, partly multiple victims of an attack with Erpresser software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany almost 20 percent of companies were already the target of a ransoming extortion.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 per cent of the victims were willing to use the solders offered by the perpetrators to reuse the requested systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators specialize their blackmailing software according to observations of Malwarebytes on attacks in corporate networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they succeed, the potentially ransmitter ransom is significantly higher than in private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "we watch today a scary quick evolution of the malware," "" "explains Malwarebytes-boss Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the" "" "World." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008, most of the Malwareprograms were laid to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators of blackmailing software discovered.</seg>
<seg id="11">First, private users were the goal, but the change to business attacks was frightening rapidly in recent months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works after a simple pattern: once active on the computer of a victim, she searches for unrecently changed files such as Word-, Excel- or Database Files as well as to archives of images and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encodes the ransomware and deletes the originals.</seg>
<seg id="14">The software will then be presented by the demands of the Erpresser.</seg>
<seg id="15">To get the end code code to the files, the victims must be cash - mostly in the form of Cryptobre Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where private users are using the personal Photo database on the game, it goes to companies for sensitive customer data or project databases, without which the production is shut down.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly, the damage expires, if a ransomware hits.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 per cent of the affected German companies reported revenue losses due to Ransomware, 13 percent had to completely disrupted business activities, in one case, people were in danger of life.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany, multiple hospitals were victims of attacks, whose patients may be threatened by the loss of acutely acutely akut.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "we always say the victims: pay not, you only support the problem," "" "explains Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay, their data will return.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers, it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know this and try to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study the safety researchers of F-Secure investigates the user interfaces and the contact with the blackmail and come to the result: the perpetrators are actually trying to set up a kind of customer service to find more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They explain how they can pay by chat, as they can pay by Bitcoin, send freely accessible support sites, or decrypt free sample files for free.</seg>
<seg id="26">And individuals shall be redeemed after payments of a few hundred Euros, companies have to deal with hard negotiate and five digit sums to get their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">Given the potentially high and relatively risky profits from the Ransomware-blackmail, hackers are always professional and share the work, explains security experts Chester Wisniewski of the antivirus provider Sophos: "a single person may write a ransomware circa within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">More likely, it is that it is three or four people.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their malware software then in the form of a software building box to the actual blackheads.</seg>
<seg id="30">The malware kits were created by the malware kits, offering advice and additional tools for one-time, solid price between 1000 and $10,000.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "the scope of delivery includes an adaptation tool, so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," "" "says Wisniewski." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">The expresses are looking for further hackers to spread the newly purchased software under the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service sector.</seg>
<seg id="34">So, one of the forums in the underground, the set buys a crime and asks for another to install the software on a lot of PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is made per given calculator.</seg>
<seg id="36">"usually, the criminals then carry spammer with the spread," explains Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is well known for many companies that ensure their data better.</seg>
<seg id="38">Over 50 percent of companies in the Malwarebytes survey are confident that Ransomware can be able to defend Ransomware by file back-ups and scannersoftware.</seg>
<seg id="39">The perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"if the encryption is no longer sufficient for successful recovery, the perpetrators impress the release instead of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing," explains Malwarebytes-boss Marcin Kleczynski.</seg>
<seg id="41">This makes the potential for damage, depending on the type of data, even higher than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">The perpetrators could also take new goals in the internet of things in the internet.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the HackerConference Defcon demonstrated safety forgers as they could have received with the Internet connected thermostat under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of winter the activating of such a blocked heating could be quite a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators will block the entire production line in a factory instead of heating in the future, Ransomware could also become a theme in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="4">Sounds rather overloaded, yet the HR-V, which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, has actually proved very flexible in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although only 1.60 m high HR-V works rather small, the passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the Fond, there is no place closely.</seg>

<seg id="9">This is less magical than it sounds: the seat surface of the back bench can be folded as a chin-up bar and thus provide storage space, which is 1.24 m high from the ground up to the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="10">The luggage boot can be loaded well, but the load-height of 650 mm is slightly higher than in the comparable Peugeot 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tested 1.6-liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 HP accelerates the HR-V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in large speed ranges.</seg>
<seg id="12">He is likely to perform his work somewhat quieter.</seg>
<seg id="13">The everyday consumption of 4,7 l / 100 km is pleasing.</seg>

<seg id="15">An all-wheel drive is not offered.</seg>
<seg id="16">The behaviour is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.</seg>

<seg id="21">The distance assistance is very reliable.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the intelligent temporegler reacts to traffic detection and throttles the speed.</seg>
<seg id="23">But the full connectivity is only available for the top-equipment: 7-inch touchscreen, Navi, App-Integration and More.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB- and an HDMI socket are under the armrest and are therefore somewhat cumbersome to reach.</seg>
<seg id="25">The approximately 29000 Euro for the well-equipped top-diesel are fine.</seg>
<seg id="26">If you don't want to invest so much, the gasoline will get 20,000 Euros, the diesel from 23000 Euro.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the evening you are going around forever, at night you wake up to hours, in the morning it is far from the wake-up clingles to think about sleep.</seg>
<seg id="3">That is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, one is in good company with such problems: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about one quarter of adults sleep and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleep problems?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep problems, and there can be many causes of common causes, emphasizes Hans-GÃ¼nter WeeÃ, member of the board member of the German Society for Schlafficking and Sleepmedicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">What you understands among them is, however, the Insomnie, thus an entry and sleep disturbance.</seg>
<seg id="8">Just to sleep through this, many people feel as unsatisfactory or inadequate, Jens Wagenknecht says, member of the German homecian association with practice in the Lower Saxon Varel.</seg>
<seg id="9">What's behind sleeping disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disturbances are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">They can cause organic, psychological or behavioral factors, but also medicines.</seg>
<seg id="12">Not rare is the disorder expression of another disorder.</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early waking is often frequent during depression," says WeeÃ.</seg>
<seg id="14">And it may be that different factors quote each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">Those who have a herniated disc can lie badly, waking up every two to three hours and starts blurably to pondering about everyday problems and care, there is an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should I become a doctor with sleep problems?</seg>
<seg id="18">Who should not sleep well over a month of at least three nights a week, and is impaired on the day, should consult a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment can look quite different: one is downcast, tired, insufficient, has difficulty with attention and concentration, is slightly irritable, has mood disorders, or bodily problems like stomach or headaches.</seg>
<seg id="20">To ease the sleep problems, it is important to find out their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">As a therapy options, such behavioural changes, cognitive behavioral therapy or even medications - classic sleeping pills only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - inquire.</seg>
<seg id="22">In Germany, Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the Interdisciplinary Medical Center of CharitÃ© University Medicine Berlin, can hardly be emphasized in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="23">Therefore, one should consult with sleeping problems at first, advising WeeÃ.</seg>
<seg id="24">Who can clarify studies, whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to sleep laboratory, and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">For instance, for examining the sleep-lab medicine, for instance, with snoring with respiratory problems, in case of disease, or if you can't find the cause of a sleeping disorder, Fietze explains.</seg>
<seg id="27">One does not need to prepare for the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"please do not make any midday sleep," says Fietze.</seg>
<seg id="30">After shelling, one goes to bed in his normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">In addition to the electrodes on the body one carries a nostrils, a chest strap and a featler on the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">It also features a camera on the ceiling of the sleeping area.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can the problems get in the handle?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of pitch screws on which one can sit for better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">WeeÃ is on: regular sleep and overtime, not too long in bed, don't sleep on the day, not watch television to sleep, avoid drinking alcohol and at night not at the clock - then you begin to calculate immediately, and that's all at all and not conducive.</seg>

<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon, the road works peacefully: parents walk with children, people sitting on the sidewalk before the houses in the sun, others are talking about late SpÃ¤ti.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the skin projects, an elementary school and nursery gardens are located.</seg>
<seg id="13">The left force is not the main concern of many local residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in Kiev since 1999, and Jana *, which attracts three children here, are mainly generated by the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the residents of the skin projects, they share the concern of increasing suffering and gentrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">It doesn't sound like a pinch, who wish to become a majority-reflection on the left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The trench, who built the Berlin Interior and the police force between home networks and their neighbours, does not seem so clearly.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional business district, which also has an average income of income and high poverty." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">Also home-occupations and their native home projects have long been part of the Kiev: in 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost the entire Mainzer street near the Rigaer.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer had been evacuated under a regular police force, many of the projects were legalized in the Rigaer and are still inhabited by people who occupied them 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the district in recent years has become increasingly becoming magnets for tourists and suffers from all over the world: now they share their lapse from GDR times and former home networks.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is also noticeable during the rent, which has increased by almost 60 percent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the newbuildings in the Rigaer are attacked as symbols for this development: they are recognizable on applied discs or freshly painted facades that were cast with color bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "no other road was mentioned this year so often with the words" "" "left-autonomous violence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">A reason why not all neighbours that consider it as a problem, could be that they are not necessarily affected by criminality: offences such as body injury become almost exclusively against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most part of the offences make things disappointed, which are more likely to meet newbuilds and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in a rental house for 17 years, cannot be persuaded by uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">In terms of violence, it is important: people in 94 are their neighbours who don't have been this.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars is no longer give up in the Rigaer anymore.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "for this architectomy was not a criminal burning point, on the contrary:" "" "here one helps one another, lives together on the street and gets more from each other than elsewhere." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer is deliberately drawn into the Rigaer street - and stayed.</seg>
<seg id="31">This is why it was so important that the local residents got their way back: from the police, politics and the media, which suddenly claimed the interpretations of the district in July.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of inhabitants like Neugebauer, the road will continue to take away: through non-historical buildings in former building gaps that displace old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"these are ultimately condominiums, which are not interesting for many, - here are people who are not so well covered," she says.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "violence and destruction I can absolutely not guate." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should we do if one never listens to anyone?</seg>
<seg id="36">There is frustration at all sides, even by the police and the residents.</seg>
<seg id="37">For early drains that tense over colour bombs, Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding: the skin projects and the left scene belonged to the Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="38">Who draws, should be aware of that - just like someone who moves to a pub, complain about noise there.</seg>
<seg id="39">All mentioned persons have asked to have asked, not to be named with their right name</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuschle is new refugee officers</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact partner in the integration and organiser.</seg>
<seg id="3">Also, she is social worker.</seg>
<seg id="4">Since July Annika Deuschle has been the refugee treasurer for Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogy supports the team of managing Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">It looks as a contact partner for all players: refugees, working group refugees, administration, authorities and who else are involved.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine customer of the working group indicates that Deuschle is now being thankful that Deuschle is now there that has a problem above all.</seg>
<seg id="8">Thus, some - less spotting than rather on the multitude of desired tasks - that meant, when managing the place wanted to write.</seg>
<seg id="9">A management expert was sought out with a talent for languages and people, associated with a long-term experience in social work, animating a jealous woolen.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administrative work is not its central area, Annika Deuschle comments.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it concerns organization, work with the people on site and also behind the scenes as well as network activity.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 percent position on three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "it was high time," "" "says Regine client, that Annika Deuschle and main actors are supported." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">There are large and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon new containers in the WasenstraÃe</seg>
<seg id="17">It has been a significant problem for some time to find apartments for connecting flights who have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">The municipalities are in charge of the provision.</seg>
<seg id="19">They must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented residential premises.</seg>
<seg id="20">The costs for construction, rent or renovation of these accommodations must carry the municipalities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">Responsibility changes from the counratory board and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been quite difficult for some time.</seg>
<seg id="24">In fact, administration does not find private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">So far, it does not have to be dependent on private apartments so Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Thus, communities have to be erased, as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So, new container will soon be erected in the washing road.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with flats it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Prospect is the catchword, are Regine customer and Annika Deuschle einig.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a firm stay there are internship placements, training places, training places, one-euro jobs and assistance services for refugees and migrants who have to be folded or furnished.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reports Regine customer.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help housework, do-profit work - and that motivates and very tidy, like Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes the work for the community leads to a positive influence.</seg>
<seg id="34">This is "no employment therapy."</seg>
<seg id="35">Activity, however, does not mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day has a fixed structure, say Deuschle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">Humans would need to develop an influenza experience.</seg>
<seg id="38">So there are offers such as sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So we also jump on managing and volunteer.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees feel the feeling they are welcome in Germany and welcome.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "" "" "they must explain the refugees that it just takes and they can bridge it sensible, for example with language courses." ""</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "" "" "whosoever would like the feeling of evolution, he could not help anyone in Urbach, but should not work and be unprofitable, he will never integrate himself." ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"" "problem cases is also," "" "says customer honest," "" "People who do nothing at all." "" "the work of Deuschle and customer is always willing to motivate others." ""</seg>
<seg id="47">That's all a "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: have the two of the most recent incidents afraid of radicalization, even in a small community like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "no, Regine says quite clearly," "" "What mancher may call naive." "" "but a risk of dying could not ban it." ""</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitive.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are subject to the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have the fear that the attacks bring them completely in demand.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with," says Regine Customer.</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So we must watch main and volunteer work locally and in the region's activities.</seg>
<seg id="56">In fact, they are always in the background that soon a new push of refugees and migrants could come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a upper limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">This question seems to answer, shakes up politics.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually, it is unfair to place helpers on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"we haven't arrived in Urbach, where we would go," says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would be able to relax.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer also makes it clear that the Urbacher can already be relieved even so that the previous people are rational.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently 100 persons, mainly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But when people are in need, they should help them, both women are lonely.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there is no simple answers.</seg>
