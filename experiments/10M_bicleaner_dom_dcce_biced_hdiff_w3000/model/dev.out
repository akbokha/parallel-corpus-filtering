Obama receiving Netanyahu
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not friendly .
they wanted to speak about the implementation of the international agreement as well as on Te@@ hr@@ an for dest@@ ab@@ ili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
but at the meeting there should also be a conflict with the Palest@@ inians and the argu@@ ed two @-@ state solution .
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises the ongoing settlement of Israel and raises the lack of peace for the peace process .
by Obama &apos;s deal on the Iranian nuclear programme , the relationship between the two continues to deteri@@ or@@ ate .
in March Netanyahu , Netanyahu , at the invitation of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , was held a controversial speech given by the US Congress .
speaking with Obama was not spoken , a meeting had turned this with reference to the vote in Israel at the time of his time .
in an emergency call professor , having shot his girlfriend
in a emergency call , Professor Sh@@ annon Lamb told with a little c@@ iss@@ ing voice of the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officers came to his house .
Lamb was important to emphas@@ ize that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said that family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the cell phone .
within the House officials were found the bodies of Amy Pr@@ ent@@ iss and a hand@@ written notice that was on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m sorry I could und@@ o Amy and she &apos;s the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was by the authorities in the letter , and he was signed from Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb , who had traveled in two on @-@ line courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland , Mississippi , had already had 300 miles on the school grounds , where he was killed and killed by the police with a popular office professor , E@@ than Schmidt .
Delta State University Police Head , Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford , said that University staff have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 .
he said that Lamb has taken the cat@@ astroph@@ ic emergency call after that .
until the end of the day there was another death : lamb took life when the police en@@ circle him .
one day after shooting in the university , students and lec@@ turers to hide behind closed doors , the authorities will still try to get a picture of what Lamb sp@@ illed .
the details that were published by the medi@@ ators at both ends of the state were full of details , including those who knew him , helped him to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teachers .
students said they were looking forward to their lessons .
the police in G@@ auti@@ er , where Pr@@ un@@ iss died , he had no history of violence or a criminal pre@@ history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt himself had mentioned a book written in a book which he mentioned the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wonderful people &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both were housed in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose apprenti@@ ce have 17 members , and many students visited courses from both .
at the same time , there were some inc@@ lin@@ ations to proble@@ matic behavi@@ ors .
a student , Bran@@ don Be@@ aver@@ s , the Lamb praised , said he seemed to be a bit nervous and nervous , as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , told her to have told him to hurt us at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
Lamb had asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said that he had any health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
most recent changes in employment policy at the University meant that the promotion for the Lamb had worked so hard for him who would not make a guarantee for an automatic way to an order as a Assistant Professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions , which Lamb is no longer answer .
after the escape from the campus , police later found Lam@@ bs Tra@@ ce when he entered the Mississippi from Arkan@@ s@@ as .
before he was arrested , Lamb s@@ nat@@ ched himself with an .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parents on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississippi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ al Johnson .
his car ran still in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why they went to this house , but Johnson told us that he knew people who knew there .
Lamb grew up in the region .
Lamb opened his work at the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a town with around 12,000 inhabitants and taught geography and education .
he received his doctorate in spring in spring .
one of the long @-@ standing friends Lam@@ bs produced him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny .
Carla Hair@@ ston , she was 15 and lamb , was 20 when they met by joint friends .
she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried some years to match her guitar game .
back then he was the woman of women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all the girls are melted away when he was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hair@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson subur@@ b of Bran@@ don . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb and Pr@@ ent@@ iss were obviously some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the case Lamb , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no certificate from a marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house , adjacent to a Ba@@ you in G@@ auti@@ er .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ ent@@ iss , Shawn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said she had divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was 19 years old now .
&quot; it was totally destroyed by the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter .
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he has never met Lamb , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail , he heard that Lamb was interested in music and playing blues .
Lamb met Pr@@ ent@@ iss , when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail saw them both on a summer fair .
later they played the one or another gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings their own music .
Pr@@ ent@@ iss was a nurse , which worked online for various companies .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ keeper , and sometimes convers@@ ational coordin@@ ator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , one weak illuminated bar near G@@ auti@@ er , said that he Lamb and Pr@@ ent@@ ure Night in the night 5 . September last time he finished his guitar and harmon@@ ie game end before an annoying audience .
there was no indication that anything was not right .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were on the premises and were jo@@ king together .
I mean , they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first @-@ term seminars and specialised in American native people and colonial history , said Don Allan Mitchell , an English @-@ professor at the school .
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Emp@@ oria State University in Kansas and was president of his Brotherhood and the students Committee .
on Tuesday evening about 900 people attended the Delta State Campus , including lec@@ turers , employees , students and members of the church at a cand@@ l@@ el@@ ight commem@@ oration ceremony .
Sch@@ mid@@ ts &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also attended the vig@@ il , during the &quot; B@@ right Morning Star &quot; and &quot; Amazing Grace . &quot;
the lessons will be resumed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; La@@ For@@ ge said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
Amy and Rog@@ el@@ io Soli@@ s reported from Cleveland , Mississippi .
Associated Press Auth@@ ors Emily Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Mississippi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story was corrected to contra@@ dict that the police said that Lamb didn &apos;t lay the emergency , after he shot to the emergency , and that he referred to as his wife , but there was no indication that the two ever got married .

the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theatre , waiting for the roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat next to me is empty , and it gradually became clear that Princess Diana is sitting next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; Secretary General Ban Ki @-@ moon said that his response to Russia &apos;s reinforced military support is , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no military solution &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of almost five years of conflict , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen@@ ing violence and mis@@ ery for millions of people . &quot; &quot; &quot;

ban told a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Minister of the five constant member states of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - at the Edge of the Assembly &apos;s Assembly in this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he de@@ pl@@ agu@@ ed that the expenditure on the Council and the Syrian people and the regional powers can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation in@@ soluble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ban urged the five permanent members to show against the crisis in Syria the same solidarity and unity , which they have proved in the submission of a nuclear deal with Iran .
8 Re@@ frac@@ tional values which show that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to fire him as a flop .
others have done him as a joke .
and some people are waiting for a collapse .
but no matter how some rep@@ ubli@@ can try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper ranks in p@@ olls , it does not work ( yet ) .
ten of the last eleven national p@@ olls show Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit area , and some begin to seriously wonder what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of the real estate market .
of course , it is too early in the election period .
no one claims that tr@@ ump will probably win the rep@@ ubli@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts emphas@@ ize that during this period in 2011 Rick Per@@ r@@ ys was given guidance to the rising Herman Cain , of which none of them won only a state in the nom@@ ination process .
there are many reasons why he would have been fighting in a general election .
but outdoor users like everyone &apos;s E@@ b Bus@@ es Super P@@ AC and the conservative Economic Group Club for Growth now recognize tr@@ um@@ ps cal@@ care@@ ous assets and start to drain their dollar in order to overthrow him .
here are some recent down@@ slo@@ gan@@ s , pointing out that the real estate market is not only a temporary phase :
Tr@@ um@@ ps popularity values turned around 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey of the Mon@@ mouth University found that only two out of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans were positive .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August , it was 52 percent .
now six of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a positive opinion of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three of them say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures keep up in the early states .
a Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac voting in Iowa last week determined that 60 percent of rep@@ ublic@@ ans have good opinion of tr@@ ump .
two thirds of the GO@@ P sector members would be happy with tr@@ ump than candidates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a pol@@ l of CNN / OR@@ C last week 67 percent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans would either be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enth@@ r@@ alled or &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; if Tr@@ ump would be nominated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only two of them say , &quot; they would be angry &quot; if he were the candidate .
only Ben Car@@ son makes about the same gust@@ o as dr@@ ump ( 43 percent say , they would be &quot; enth@@ r@@ alled &quot; vs. 40 percent , who would say the same about tr@@ ump ) .
the next one in enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of rep@@ ubli@@ can voters say that they were &quot; un@@ happy &quot; or &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if Je@@ b Bush , the establishment of the establishment , the candidate .
a majority of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans does not see Tr@@ um@@ ps temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ised for its bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive claims , 52 percent of the emerging Irish voters think that the real Estate business mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament for a president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
according to Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac , the same number is applicable in the first pre@@ selection state of the nation , the state of Iowa , where the same 52 percent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans think he has the personality for a commander , according to Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to effectively perform his job , and nearly six out of 10 , that its temper@@ ament not put into White House , so ABC / Post .
rep@@ ubli@@ can voters get used to the idea .
when they raise their schol@@ ars , rep@@ ubli@@ can voters will hold a real name for real .
if you are asked who wins the GO@@ P @-@ nom@@ ination , after a pol@@ l of CNN / OR@@ C from last week , four out of ten that tr@@ ump may be the best bet .
this is a change since the time , when four out of ten of July put their money to Je@@ b Bush .
full disclos@@ ure : GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
at this point in the last cycle , four out of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans that Rick Perry would win the nom@@ ination against only 28 % for the final candidates Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
however , a multitude of GO@@ P @-@ voters will show a campaign being plau@@ sible .
even if the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump is still sm@@ ashing out .
some experts point out that the split@@ ted field is likely to contribute to tr@@ um@@ ps leadership , while the anti @-@ tr@@ ump support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates .
but a survey of the Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ an @-@ head race between tr@@ ump and most other rep@@ ubli@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump re@@ counts majority support .
Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points ahead , before Walker 15 points , before Walker 15 points , ahead of Je@@ b Bush for 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Kas@@ im and Chris Christie 33 points .
it &apos;s a head @-@ to @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who strikes him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ an @-@ head race .
a large majority of Donald Tr@@ ump @-@ fans says she was educated in her mind .
a new pol@@ l of C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of the voters will support Tr@@ ump , saying that they will determine their voices .
of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can really say , never change the opinion .
46 percent said that they open the door open to other candidates .
however , Tr@@ um@@ ps is the strongest competition at the moment of the other out@@ sider , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters think that they have formed their own opinion , are twice as common for Tr@@ ump .
six of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans say that they co@@ inci@@ de with Tr@@ ump when immigration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since then Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign had called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rape &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of Mexico in his election campaign in front of two months , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Immig@@ ration to the public dis@@ course of 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some are worried that the bom@@ b@@ astic development of Tr@@ ump is crucial H@@ isp@@ ano @-@ American from the Republi@@ can Party and will damage the re@@ orient@@ ating efforts .
but after the new ABC / Post pol@@ l of Monday six of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say that they co@@ inci@@ de with Tr@@ ump on questions of immigration .
so long as immigration is left in the spotlight , Donald Tr@@ ump also will do .
the fru@@ stration above the government climb@@ s to new heights .
now on Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son , meanwhile half of the support of rep@@ ubli@@ can voters , mainly by its out@@ sider status .
six of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say in the new Monday survey of ABC / Post , they rather want a political out@@ sider than someone with government experience .
and they are also angry at Washington .
a survey of Des Mo@@ ines register / Bloom@@ berg in Iowa , two weeks ago , shows that three of four Iowa Rep@@ ublic@@ ans are fru@@ str@@ ated by the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , with 54 percent &quot; un@@ happy &quot; and 21 per cent . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five exclusive residential neighbor@@ hoods in Germany
here at the Hob@@ oo@@ ken@@ weg is the most expensive community with a view over the North Sea .
the street costs a square @-@ square meter of a building of 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros .
&quot; according to Sy@@ lt , the offer of objects is naturally limited , &quot; it is meant to be the high price .
a new study shows in which particular layers cost a square meter most .
of course , 18,@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little .
unlike Germany &apos;s top housing , one of the price is like Pe@@ an@@ uts .
the real estate service provider Angel &amp; Völk@@ ers published a ranking of the most exclusive German homes - with square met@@ ering prices in dro@@ pping high@@ s .
there are several tens of thousands of Euros - per square meter , well noted .
but good who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is generally not at the top .
Champions League : Bayern @-@ Dream launch thanks to Müller and Gö@@ tze
double Tor@@ schüt@@ z in Pi@@ re@@ aus : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas Müller simply has a run .
a happy hit by Thomas Müller , the FC Bayern was the way to a earned 3rd : 0 at Olympi@@ ac@@ os Piraeus . then it went .
a so@@ vereign in the Champions League season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Gö@@ tze received a dream start to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mission Milan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at FC Bayern . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team of coach P@@ ep Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won her kick @-@ off in the Champions League at the Greek record master Olympi@@ ac@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Mül@@ lers Double Pack@@ ages ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and Gö@@ tz@@ es hits ( 8@@ 9. ) at 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ f@@ th start @-@ up series should be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola finally wants to get the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich .
Müller received at his 28th place in the Champions League for the Bavarian leadership of the Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto , who had modified a f@@ lange back shot of the World Champion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we won &apos;t under@@ estimate that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria @-@ Captain Philipp L@@ ah@@ m promised ahead of the game in the Kara@@ is@@ k@@ ak@@ is stadium in front of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 @-@ blo@@ ated fans - and the Munich held word . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated performance , without shine .
Pi@@ re@@ aus won his youngest six home games in the top class , among them against renowned clubs like Manchester United , At@@ lé@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 , there were also Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) .
but Bavaria , posted in seven Europ@@ ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams wanted not to be the next victim .
they ran cour@@ age@@ ously , in their offen@@ sives , but often at work .
the attacks were led to often by a shift in Lin@@ ks@@ outside Douglas Costa , who had rarely happened to the former Braunschwei@@ ger Omar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller made more happiness from right than his flan@@ k hit the right upper part of the upper part of To@@ re@@ ck .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the world champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
Robert Le@@ wand@@ owski was the best opportunities in half one .
first , as the Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Stür@@ mer ide@@ ye Brown presented the head ball from Poland on the line ( 26 . ) .
then by direct withdrawal , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto with his knee ( 3@@ 5. ) .
although the Bayern was used to domin@@ ate the domin@@ ating game , Pir@@ an N@@ adel@@ sti@@ che was able to put .
but Manuel Neuer has failed .
thus , as he drew a shot of ide@@ ye on the lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
new Gu@@ ardi@@ ola left a square with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng who had to do it well .
Mario Go@@ tze , after muscular problems back in the cad@@ res , was first sitting outside .
the World Cup hero had given green light just after the final training , he said Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; he who wants to do something else is v@@ icious . &quot;
in the first change , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought a King@@ sley Com@@ an for the chi@@ pped Le@@ wand@@ owski ( 5@@ 9. ) .
i@@ dol came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( 7@@ 6. ) and made it clear 13 minutes later , by El@@ f@@ meter there was still a continuation of it .
before the game , it was in the stadium to Kra@@ w@@ everyone .
after a smaller group of partially avoided Bayern fans in their audience souvenir , the supporters of the hosts were clearly prov@@ oked by words and gest@@ ures , attacks the security forces and went up against the Munich &apos;s followers .
at least one Bayern Fan &apos;s fan was wounded of the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk to lose teeth
whoever smo@@ kes , it doesn &apos;t just harm the lungs , but also the teeth - this is close to a Potsdam long @-@ term study .
good news : when handling rapidly falls the risk .
smokers have a significantly higher risk of losing their teeth early .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this emerges from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , among them several employees of the German Institute for Food Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by comparison to non @-@ smoking , smoking consumed their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely , in order to lose the 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 compart@@ ments .
scientists have observed more than 23.@@ 300 participants .
main causes of dental out@@ age are tooth decay and inflammation of the gum , st@@ resses the DI@@ f@@ E .
for this perio@@ don@@ tit@@ is smoking is a risk factor , emphas@@ ize the authors .
the link between smoking and tooth loss would go back on frequent gum disease in smokers .
not fully resolved , however , smoking is also increased risk of c@@ aries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people who heard with smoking , could reduce their risk but within a short time , the researchers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Journal of Dental Research &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it could take over ten years until the companion disappeared again at the level of non @-@ smokers , explained first author Thomas Dietrich of the English University of Birmingham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; let people persu@@ ade people to be non @-@ smo@@ ker , study leader H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking explo@@ res the lifetime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not smoking is good for lung and vessels and results in accordance with our findings even to good health health by age .
in Germany over 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years are affected by denti@@ sts , the DI@@ f@@ E shared .
earlier studies have already pointed out that smoking will increase the risk of early failure .
the new long @-@ term study suggest the findings .
archae@@ ologists at the Rhine river Rhine at lef@@ to@@ ver of the late anti@@ quity
for the repeated time , archaeological finds have been made in Cologne ar@@ cheological findings .
in the proximity of the construction site for the new Rhein@@ bou@@ lev@@ ard we have excav@@ ated the Roman @-@ German@@ ic @-@ Museum Skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings , said Museum Director Marcus Trier on Tuesday .
since the start of the construction work on the Rhine , hist@@ ori@@ ans have been searching for so @-@ called ground monuments .
all construction projects in the City District of Cologne will always be considered to be an expert for Archae@@ ological ground care .
the ar@@ che@@ ologists were now found in the third building segment of the Rhein@@ bou@@ lev@@ ards .
from text documents had already been known that at the place in the 4th century , a fortress and in the 8th century have stood a church , explained in Trier .
along with the remains of the fortress and the church tower , a cemetery with around 350 graves has also been discovered , which probably belonged to the church .

EU Commission proposes a new trial in dispute over TTIP
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for its shar@@ pen@@ ing over the trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement TTIP , the European Commission proposed an extensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the controversial private res@@ ett@@ lement for disputes between companies and countries should therefore be replaced by a transparent system which corresponds to considerably more traditional courts in its work@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that trust citizens &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Commissioner Cecilia Malm@@ ström &apos;s responsible for introducing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Swe@@ de has to introduce the proposal as a European negoti@@ ating position in the free trade talks with the USA .
the German government announced support .
TTIP should become the largest free trade zone in the world with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans to reform current refer@@ ral procedures will be obvious that the EU states and the US will jointly select its independent judges for a new investment division . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they should come to equal parts from the EU , USA , and third @-@ party countries .
the first instance is also planned for the first time .
it would allow it to rise to an indication of jud@@ gements .
until now the proceedings involved in refer@@ ee , a asser@@ tive opportunity for their jud@@ gements , was not given .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the discussion of recent months , it became obvious that citizens didn &apos;t trust the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and justice , commented Malm@@ ström . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long run , they want to work to a International Investment Court in the long term .

del@@ ik@@ ater Folk of Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens is sitting on stage in the Cologne Prime club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
in addition to it is a fli@@ p@@ chart showing the in@@ ti@@ mid @-@ acting Fol@@ ks@@ aler , the picturesque US state of Michigan , with film sti@@ ft .
the entire audience , about 40 persons , is nearly occupied by Stev@@ ens lecture .
he talks about various places that he always records on the map to report about his minim@@ alist and tender songs .
where they were created , and what it looks like in his homeland .
since then , Stev@@ ens has been portra@@ yed as wonderfully creative mas@@ ons .
with the 2003 released and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Michigan : the Great Lake State &quot; appeared smart composed songs , which beat itself harmonious very close to American folk of the late six@@ ties , but can drift out at any time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a rum@@ our arises , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michigan , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be the first part of a uni@@ formed series : each of the 50 US states should be rev@@ oked as a result . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but already in 2004 and in the Rhine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been released and had a positive expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reduced Stev@@ ens occurs here .
there are guitar and ban@@ jo ready for him .
one year later , the musician comes back to the series in New York .

the album entered the US Bill@@ board charts and did not lack an annual list of influential music media in any time .
following a highly productive experiment , Stev@@ ens came to &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensive electronic publishing .
this sixth ordinary studio album is still broad@@ orchest@@ rated but performed by programmed sequences or beats and plays with every effect and rever@@ ber@@ ation .
recently moved to the smaller clubs , the stage shows here as well as the colorful spectac@@ le of ne@@ on @-@ head@@ bands and is a lumin@@ es@@ cent stage setting .
currently Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens is a part of a five @-@ man band from Germany .

&quot; &quot; &quot; theatre shows mainly the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; available since March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although close to 2,000 guests are banned in their chairs , the Sig@@ ch@@ ant@@ ful Stev@@ ens return to in@@ tim@@ acy and folk .
without a word to judge the audience , the Group performed excellent musicians through the broad@@ ly enriched album .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the audience hear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lecture &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you can throw away the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plate in the valley . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only to an en@@ core is Stev@@ ens modest , plays acoustic quite older songs and eventually ten@@ ds to applause bur@@ sting applause .
Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ ns debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s parliamentary election
Mr Cor@@ by@@ ke &apos;s debut in the Prime Minister &apos;s parliamentary election with tension is expected since its election .
the new Labour MEP Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n will be his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s parliamentary election for the first time with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to show@@ case the first of his six given questions shortly after lunch , whereby its performance from the media probably and the Labour Members will be inspected from the vicinity .
he called for &quot; less theater and more facts &quot; during this weekly event .
he has also said that he could not skip some sessions to leave colleagues .
the encounter will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Cor@@ by@@ l &apos;s leadership , as a member of his appointment as a member of Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ a@@ et and his speech at the TU@@ C annual meeting on Tuesday .
meanwhile , during the singing of the national an@@ them during a commem@@ oration ceremony commemor@@ ating the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , the decision of a number of T@@ ory @-@ M@@ PS prov@@ okes and stands in the focus of several title pages stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s decision to sing the national an@@ them , has drawn attention to himself
&quot; &quot; &quot; a speaker by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; standing in respec@@ tful action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he was acknowledged the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ ab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the Labour leader , to sing national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished .
nearly a dozen of the shadows have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ &apos;s leaders , and they are conven@@ ing in dis@@ agreements on the economy , defence and foreign policy , while fewer than a sixth of the parliamentary party adopted him as leaders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences differ also within Labour &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Mr Cor@@ by@@ l &apos;s statements to the position of the European Union and the limit of winn@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference , that Labour mut@@ ations suggest to remove the whole idea of a whole total .
&quot; &quot; &quot; hours later Mr Smith said , the shadow of employment and pen@@ sions , that the party is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that it is only towards government plans to lower the limit of 26@@ ,000 £ to 23@@ ,000 £ . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n is the fifth Labour leader , whom David Cameron , since he is T@@ ory boss in the last decade , across the Dis@@ patch Box across the European Parliament .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Labour Chair , who has promised another policy of policies , says that he has given &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and gave it more than 30.000 suggestions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the prime minister of the Prime Minister is consistent , and that he under@@ took both &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; beat &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the stre@@ ak with resi@@ den@@ ies and to focus on serious problems like poverty , ine@@ quality and challenges for young people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the shadow of Economic Minister , is represented when he is not taking part - for example if Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues can occasionally show the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the man &apos;s spokes@@ man to discuss the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when he was a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he would be willing to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le theatre . &quot; but some years later , he acknowledged that he states that he failed .
when she was sent to television in 1990 , quest@@ s became the most important bar@@ ometer of the ruling of a leader and his leadership in the fore@@ house and his position among his par@@ liament@@ arians , while critics have argu@@ ed that it became a caric@@ ature and require extensive reforms .

pounds raises by accelerated increase in the United Kingdom
the pounds rose as soon as possible to display an increase in the United Kingdom &apos;s wage growth . in parallel , the FT@@ SE 100 was raised by the B@@ BM@@ iller Geb@@ iel by the Geb@@ ot@@ sz@@ iel SA@@ BM@@ iller .
between May and July , earnings without bonuses in the United Kingdom grew by 2.9 % compared with the same period of the same period .
this percentage had been the fastest and appreciated inv@@ alu@@ ation in 2009 at the time of a rate of interest .
the pound has climbed more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1,@@ 550@@ 5 and was climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % compared to the Euro to 1,@@ 37@@ 30 € .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index concluded with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6.@@ 2@@ 29,@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share in the market and made a jump of 20 % after takeover offer by the Riv@@ al AB In@@ Be@@ v .
a transaction would combine the two biggest bre@@ wer@@ ies of the world and bring brands like Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
Bur@@ berry shares were the encour@@ aging messages from the competition for luxury sources of Rich@@ em@@ ont , 0.9 % higher .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts latest sales figures beat all expectations and also showed that sales in China is a key market for Bur@@ berry - growth out@@ sour@@ ced again .
shares of G@@ LEN@@ COR@@ E increased by 5 % after the mining process claimed that it took 2.5 billion $ through stock sales as part of its debt reduction strategy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the stocks of the packaging and paper company MON@@ DI were the largest los@@ ers on the index , while Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had its estim@@ ation for the company rating on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sell &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ D Sports increased by 3.1 % , after the sports changing company had reported an pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.6 million for the first half year .
the boss of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages increase cargo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the CEO of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers might mean &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more purchasing power in the bags of potential customers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is unlikely that these purchasing power will be the higher labour costs in his company , &quot; he says .
the cost could be the expansion plans by J@@ D Sports , added , and that could mean that there will be less additional jobs .
Justin Bie@@ ber in the Capital : in the Bie@@ ber Expedition in Berlin
Justin Bie@@ ber , Meg@@ ast@@ ar .
per@@ vas@@ ive 21 years young , a hill@@ fl@@ ing with superf@@ lu@@ ous FR@@ IS@@ E .
the type with the platinum blu@@ ef@@ in hair is 100 million Euro hard .
rather even more .
at present Mon@@ sie@@ ur Bie@@ ber is in Berlin .
and the generation U@@ 17 turns through .
like Vik@@ toria Rud@@ zin@@ ska .
the 15 @-@ year @-@ old has never heard the name &quot; R@@ itz Carl@@ ton . &quot;
not bad .
hundreds of fans came to Justin yesterday .
including E@@ wa and Vik@@ toria from Poland .
since 7 o &apos;clock in the morning , the Pol@@ in sits on Pots@@ dam@@ er Platz in the cold stone sla@@ b on Pots@@ dam@@ er Platz .
the Bie@@ ber Construction : here you can rely I@@ dol , whose posters hang in st@@ alls , since Monday evening .
the suite in which the Canadian singer lives in exactly as much as her mom@@ my E@@ wa lost half a year .
when at all .
that says : &quot; actually my Vik@@ toria would have to sit in the tenth grade in high school . &quot;
&quot; I am fulfilling a dream . &quot;
school attendance ?
who is it@@ ching it ?
the fans not .
also Bie@@ ber itself does not .
he worried that anyway .
for the advertisement in the promotional period of the super @-@ collector , he c@@ ashed three million , a bi@@ enni@@ al deal with an anti @-@ p@@ im@@ ples company , and lots of dollars in the Bie@@ ber account .
and at every doll , which looks like he and about the cargo , the jum@@ per also does .
when Justin Bie@@ ber drinks a coffee , you marv@@ els at the window .
it shall be carried out more than 100 million .
some say that hyp@@ e would go too far .
others , after all , are just in the United States and the UK with his new single &quot; What do you Me@@ an ? &quot; at number 1 .
after the Bie@@ ber itself , whose fourth album is to follow in November , the many N@@ ul@@ len are not interested .
at least he does so .
P@@ EG@@ IDA Poster brings creativity to the potato @-@ twe@@ eter
potatoes or D@@ öner ?
it is both - and in the potato @-@ woofer , designed by the Ol@@ den@@ burger chain of Han@@ i Al@@ h@@ ay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; inspired by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; potato &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a poster the Peg@@ ida movement , Al@@ h@@ ay potato and meat put together to a ske@@ wer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this idea took him a poster at a Peg@@ ida demonstration with the inscription &quot; potato instead of the &quot; twe@@ eter , &quot; which he had seen randomly in the television .
since then a barbecue ske@@ wers in his shop , which is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; this is Mul@@ tik@@ ult@@ i for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ h@@ ay .
the idea of Lebanon has now changed to the Patent Office in Munich .
according to the authority , it has recently been protected as utility models .
however , how much flesh and how much potatoes the ske@@ wer contains , Al@@ h@@ ay doesn &apos;t want to betra@@ y .
just as much : &quot; it tastes better , &quot; he finds .
the culinary international understanding also goes well to its customers .
met@@ cash starts floor @-@ speed campaign to fight al@@ di@@ - assault
Met@@ cash is trying to protect the IG@@ A branch before a Al@@ di @-@ rise in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholesale dealers Met@@ cash has launched an adequate financial campaign to defend the market share of IG@@ A retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of an 700 million US @-@ invasion .
while Al@@ di has prepared the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia in early next year , Met@@ cash and IG@@ A @-@ supermarkets are preparing their relations with local food suppliers and marketing the IG@@ A brand through ma@@ inst@@ ream marketing and marketing about social media , as well as events like Adelaide @-@ Show .
IG@@ A dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as ice producers Simm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ borough , distributed in IG@@ A @-@ shops and shop owner who sell vali@@ dated tickets for the South Australian soccer league to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ cash is further details of its defence strategy on September 29 , when the whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers of the food , alcohol and equipment has led its annual investors strategy day .
there &apos;s a lot on the game since South Australia and Western Australia make up almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A shop shops and generate higher profit mar@@ gins than Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A network in the eastern states .
buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ or@@ ically provincial and IG@@ A retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in eastern Australia .
however , analysts as Morgan Stanley told that Al@@ di will take away five percent of the food market in these two countries after opening his first markets and will take away all existing actors , but mainly independent retailers .
according to a report published in this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stanley said that IG@@ A single retailers could lose 360 million revenue per year and cash cash 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this pre@@ diction is based on the assum@@ ption that Al@@ di has opened 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA , and generating revenue of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
while the losses in food and food markets , met@@ cash could cost around 13 million $ a profit before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ ric market shares lo@@ oses market shares in the eastern states , mostly to Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that IG@@ A buyers are the most loyal .
Morgan Stanley is gaining revenues in excess of 3.8 percent in 2016 , rising from 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and will reduce its market share by 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020 .
last week the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , reported in Melbourne that Met@@ ric probably will probably disappear within a decade . met@@ cash will van@@ ish .
Met@@ cash accepted it publicly to respond publicly to the comments by Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash with Mr Dou@@ glass has made contact with Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
since 2010 , IG@@ As Market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent , and revenues from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Food and Food Trading , which is about 1,200 IG@@ A retailers , has fallen by 43 percent , reflec@@ ting the operating debt reduction in the equal pressure on turnover and mar@@ gins .
the whol@@ es@@ aler is , however , inv@@ ests more than $ 150 million to increase sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths with hundreds of products every week to improve and IG@@ A retailers with improving their shops throughout the fast growing fresh food and provide a better selection of private label food@@ stu@@ ffs .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s main business leader Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adaptation and loading ho@@ ists will be put to Elan , and hopes that the whol@@ es@@ aler for the first time will return to a profit growth in four years in 2017 .
Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by President of Australian Tennis Association Steve He@@ aly
Than@@ h Kok@@ k@@ ak@@ is deserves praise for his behaviour as a cr@@ iti@@ que .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Than@@ h Kok@@ k@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Cy@@ gios and des@@ erved praise for his own conduct on the President of the Australian tennis player Steve He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; coconut k@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , who is always referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Special KS &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; referring to the not@@ orious confron@@ tation of Kyr@@ gios with Stan WA@@ W@@ R@@ IN@@ KA in the spotlight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a fier@@ y qualifying game in Cincinnati soon afterwards , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Harrison set up twice by the ump@@ ire , taking Harrison : &quot; WA@@ W@@ R@@ IN@@ KA had to hit Kyr@@ gios , and I should propos@@ e the child . &quot;
while he last saw how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket , after a cr@@ amp had a potential US Open victory of Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is defended from He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place in the Singles @-@ Cup semi @-@ final against Britain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a thing that I should deliver me rather , is the fact that after my view Than@@ asi was a little going down in the dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has frac@@ tured a ra@@ cket in the US Open , but he &apos;s not the first player to break a bat of fru@@ stration to himself , and I know Than@@ h good enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even under the fairly prov@@ ok@@ ative circumstances with Harrison and so on and I think he des@@ erved much appreciation .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I believe he was treated a little too stern .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard and he fits in the team and so on , he has never worked with other players , he is getting hard , he is well in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged by his own mer@@ its .
&quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly also supported the deci@@ ding who started to consider this decision which k@@ icks on Friday and he describes the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; joint decision &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the right to all but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return to the team as a long @-@ term strength part of the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; first we wish that the team is completely focused on competition and not on all the contro@@ vers@@ y around &#91; Kyr@@ gios &#93; , &quot; He@@ aly said .
and I believe that Nick made very fast the asc@@ ension , what people like Feder@@ er and Murray . he asc@@ ends to the eyes of the public , but we try to support him , but we try to understand him the consequences of his work . some time outside the li@@ mel@@ ight , in which he can only think about it , and it &apos;s best for the team and it &apos;s the best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declared emergency , close the border , holding refugees back
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hungary declar@@ es the emergency and locked the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all notes that tried to get illeg@@ ally into the country . everything with the aim to stop the influ@@ x of migrants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
chaos followed on the border when hundreds of migrants drow@@ ned in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ land and Serbian officials re@@ acted with anger .
people who fled from violence were stuck for an unknown time in a country ro@@ am on the road between the two coun@@ ties of the countries and built tents and settled down there .
but fru@@ str@@ ations increased .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a police helicopter above them , the migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open the border &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opened the border ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and cried out ins@@ ults towards the Hungarian authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some were taken from protest gro@@ c@@ eries and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister stated that it would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants are sent back from Hungary , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece came . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there must be meetings with Brussels and other countries in the coming days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Iv@@ ica Dac@@ ic said in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border reached a day after the 28 @-@ Nations block at a strict meeting in Brussels , no joint immigration policy could be agreed .
however , the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who had taken refuge in Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that the next month or until the end of the year - an agreement reached that the EU states would have another 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria , on Tuesday demanded a special summit of the European Union to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
Hungary , however , did not place his hopes on a resol@@ ute action from Brussels or his neighbors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the not@@ ary in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to combat the crisis so that they could un@@ block roads and make asylum procedures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Hungarian Minister of Foreign Affairs Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said , meanwhile , that his country plan to build a bar@@ bed wire along its border to Romania , to stop the influ@@ x of migrants from the country - after having finished a fence at the Serbian border .
C@@ BS news correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even the prison in@@ mates were deployed to construct the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few months , Hungary has become a significant bott@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insist@@ ed that most of the coming economic refugees are looking for a better life , and non @-@ war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new laws , which came into force around midnight in Hungary , are crossing the border , or the dam@@ aging of the 4 @-@ metre ( 13 ft ) high fence , who ruled the government along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws also lay higher prison sentences for the traff@@ ickers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the situation that was created through the up@@ heav@@ als , the Hungarian government proclaimed the state of state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said government advoc@@ ates Z@@ olt@@ an Kov@@ acs re@@ lic@@ ates in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the Parliament must still agree on the use of the military , which is expected next week , but rep@@ orters from Associated Press have already seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , a country @-@ security advis@@ er to Or@@ ban , said that authorities have 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others were already deeper into the country .

election @-@ 2016 : Hillary Clinton &apos;s lead to Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national survey
former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton keeps a double @-@ digit lead in the democratic race for the nom@@ ination at national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins across the ground .
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of democratic voters in the previous elections ( 58 percent previously ) , while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
vice President , Joe Bi@@ den , who has not announced yet , will be the candidate for the Presi@@ dency of the Presi@@ dential elections , receives support from 15 percent of the European elections .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than five months before the start of the elections , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is determined to support candidates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Clin@@ tons supporters are more resistant than those of other candidates .
since the C@@ BS news survey , Clinton has lost a number of demo@@ graphic groups that scored some winn@@ ings .
Clinton keeps a major advantage with women and moder@@ ates , but these jumps have reduced .
their support for the men is clearly sun@@ k , and S@@ anders is here only with 5 points .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clin@@ tons &apos;s key benefit with democratic voters less than 50 years has been dis@@ si@@ p@@ ated , and S@@ anders are now at the same level . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Clinton has a big advantage over the older voters .
last month , Clinton had been with a double @-@ bye to the Liber@@ als , but S@@ anders has a 5 @-@ point advantage over this group .
about half of the democratic elec@@ torate of the elections in Libya , they would be able to support the Clinton , if they were nominated by the Party .
one quarter would support it with some others and another 15 percent would only support them because they are the can@@ did@@ acy .
they would not support six percent .
perhaps not surprising that Clin@@ tons &apos;s current supporters are particularly excited about it .
the views are stronger with the ones who currently hadn &apos;t support Clinton - only about one quarter would love it .
while 48 percent of the Democratic voters can say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , the Republi@@ can voters say this about their leader in Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when Clin@@ tons supporters are asked in an open question , why they want they have the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the fact that it is time that a woman is President ( 13 % ) and that it is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
apart from Clin@@ tons &apos;s supporters , their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 per cent ) is also mentioned .
permission to deal with problems and voting rights are also quoted .
as the vice president has proposed a potential for the presidential guard in the Vau@@ d region , 57 percent of the US voters want to see it in the race - although a third belie@@ veth that he should not do it .
if the elections of the elections are asked , who for the party would be their second option , Bi@@ den is at the top .
of Clin@@ tons &apos;s followers say more than half that Bi@@ den would be the second choice in front of S@@ anders .
if Bi@@ den decided not to duct for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , Hillary Clinton &apos;s lead increases before S@@ anders , from 20 points with Bi@@ den in race to 30 points without him in the race .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twenty @-@ five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the election , however , this figure has decreased by 78 per cent last month . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; has risen .
nevertheless , on the question of what is more important at a Can@@ didate , Democratic Elec@@ tor give questions about the voters .
similarly as in the last month there is not a single demo@@ cr@@ ati@@ ous candidate , or potential candidate for the voters of the elections as unacceptable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Democratic Can@@ didate or potential candidates bring good results in some important features for voters in the elections of their party . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we look at Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
Bi@@ den ass@@ umes the three candidates best when Clin@@ tons &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty per cent of the democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trusted , twice as many say that over S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent have no opinion of him .
Democratic voters of the elections see also Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den in accordance with their views .
all these measurements have taken no opinion about one quarter of the democratic voters .
given questions about Hillary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server during the term as an Secretary of State , most Democratic Party of the pres@@ elections are satisfied with their explanation of the issue and say that their opinions did not affect them .
but it &apos;s another story in the American public .
half of the Americans are un@@ happy with their explanation , while only one third is satisfied .
public opinion was in March , shortly after the problem came to light , split .
most Americans said that the email contro@@ vers@@ y had no effect on their general opinions of Clinton , although 36 percent said that their opinion of her would even deteri@@ or@@ ate .
they are mostly rep@@ ubli@@ can , more than six out of 10 that found their views out of Clinton .
although Clinton is regarded as hon@@ estly and trusted by the voters of her party . only 32 percent see them as honest and trusted , eight percent less than in the last month and 15 points less since May .
62 per cent of voting rights do not hold for an honest and trusted person .
at the same time , 55 per cent of the voting rights have also seen tr@@ ump than not honest and trusted .
Clinton and Tr@@ ump , however , get good notes on the leadership .
of the six tested candidates , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush showed best hon@@ esty .
a majority look rather hon@@ estly , but as with Car@@ son many have no opinion of him .
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic Elec@@ toral votes is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves to nationwide survey near Donald Tr@@ ump
Ben Car@@ son is in the latest survey by C@@ BS News / New York Times close behind Donald Tr@@ ump
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the two candidates have become half of the support of voters in the new survey , and others lose dramatically . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rep@@ ubli@@ can voters will continue supporting Tr@@ ump in great numbers . 23 % of the last C@@ BS survey carried out by Fox News Group in recent months , conducted by 27 % in the survey on Tuesday .
but Car@@ son enjoyed the same period from 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son reaches well with demo@@ graphic groups and exceeds many rep@@ ubli@@ can voters .
the rest of the field , except for Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio @-@ Governor John Kas@@ im , is beaten with Wis@@ con@@ sins Governor Scott Walker , who fell on lowest since 10 % of support last month , now 2 % .
former Florida Governor Je@@ b Bush , former Governor of Arkan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida Senator Marco Ru@@ bio , are in third place with 6 % .
the error margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 persons of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is plus or minus 6 % and was carried out in September .
the latest CNN / OR@@ C survey , which was published last week , shows that Car@@ son is growing in the surveys , with 19 % support for rep@@ ublic@@ ans , behind the Tr@@ ump with 32 % support .
the most recent survey conducted by ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tr@@ ump mar@@ ke@@ dly before Car@@ son .
with a look at a rising in the last week Car@@ son Tr@@ ump found some side @-@ enh@@ y for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son had ap@@ ologi@@ zed to question Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s belief .
&quot; we need energy , &quot; Tr@@ ump said on Saturday , during a campaign of campaigns in Iowa .
pleasant storage temperatures : the eastern side of the Mediterranean is up to 29 degrees warm .
even if peak values are measured only in the distance , one trip to the Mediterranean enough to still find warm water .
a bath in North or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at most 17 degrees .
man@@ cher here is no longer going into the sea : a maximum of 18 degrees is the water in the North and Baltic Sea in this week , the German weather Service ( D@@ WD ) shares .
while we keep the Mediterranean Sea @-@ temperatures , the Mediterranean Sea also offers up to 29 degrees in the east .
in the Adriatic , there are 25 degrees in the middle of the Adriatic , in France 23 degrees .

five members of the Brotherhood will be charged with the death of a Bar@@ uch College new@@ ings
almost two years after a student died in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , for almost two years after a student connection in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pa . , M@@ ord@@ an@@ che was filed against five people .
in September 2013 , the members of the New York Bar@@ uch College Pi @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Brotherhood fought out to be brutal and delayed its transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death , the police informed us .
servants said he was bur@@ sted with associated eyes with a 30 pound backpack full of sand , and repeatedly tor@@ ched , while he tried to strike a frozen field on a goal .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compl@@ ains about head@@ aches , then he fell un@@ conscious .
the members of the Pi @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g was s@@ wo@@ oned and waited for an hour before they brought him to a hospital , the police .
however , they had the time to change your symptoms to goo@@ gling his symptoms and Andy Men@@ g to get the national president of the Brotherhood to advice , said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; at this point , members of the Brotherhood began to hide and put the welfare of the Brotherhood in principle of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said police chief Wagner .
he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died on his injuries next morning .
according to an aut@@ op@@ sy report Den@@ g repeated with dum@@ b power injuries to head , tor@@ so and upper th@@ igh .
&quot; for many families were destroyed by the ch@@ ic@@ ans of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies every year in the ch@@ ic@@ ans , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer , the D@@ eng@@ s family represents , in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; br@@ other@@ hoods and their members must be held to account and this step by authorities is very important . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Monroe recommended a charge for murder of the third degree for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of off@@ ical attacks and education of a criminal organisation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to take responsibility for the involved people , but if there is an organization that has - official or in@@ official - this will also have to do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the Brotherhood has resist@@ ed its affili@@ ation to the local government .
that will happen when the F@@ ed increases the interest rate
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Zin@@ c raise is come , and the Hou@@ ses will come into the branches , let return for bonds , and the economy will slip into recession . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we know that .
what we do not know how long this will last and how long it will stop .
the history of the economy provides only low guidance for the economy .
a recession came to the first interest rate within just 11 months and lasted 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve at the lifting of interest rates is often , although not always , a factor is how the economy and financial investments will react .
therefore , representatives of the U.S. Central Bank have emphas@@ ized strongly that investors should not focus on it when it begins to raise interest rates , rather for the period which is needed for norm@@ alization .
in fact several variables play a role .
however , at the end , market participants could determine that the whole excitement possibly ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated due to a Zin@@ c increase .
&quot; the first increase in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inev@@ it@@ ably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , Chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a communication to customers .
in contrast , we do not expect the gradu@@ al return of US interest to normal tre@@ ble , but still on low level to result in seis@@ mic shock , which seem to be feared .
however , this does not mean that there will be no effect .
here , a view on historic trends is based on how some areas of the economy could react :
as the market has seen last month , the provision of interest rates may make matters for a while vol@@ at@@ ile .
once the increase hits , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there seems to be a tendency to increase total assets 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which perhaps reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank Anal@@ ysts in a newer study , what happened after the F@@ ed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interest rate &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more precisely , the market has mostly in the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to the interest rate , fairly flat in the last six days ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to a current rate after 500 days , with an average returns to Bob D@@ oll , leader system str@@ ate@@ ge at Nu@@ ve@@ en asset management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s asset management .
the Deutsche Bank told that the impact on the shares ten@@ ds to occur in the Incre@@ ased cycle and thus returns to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest rates are often stim@@ ulated .
in the current case , F@@ ed is confron@@ ted with some conditions that could not give up a recession .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is extremely remarkable that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point at a interest rate of the F@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Deutsche Bank the 118 Zin@@ c plots since 1950 was only twice the nominal volume of 4.5 percent .
although the second quarter of 2015 stood at 3.6 percent , only few expect this will last and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to the Atlanta F@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; interest rates in such a frag@@ ile economic setting could be ris@@ ky and throw the question , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If this time is different , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
market participants have made the whole year on a Zin@@ ed raise . all eyes were directed to the Federal Open Market Committee in this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strateg@@ ist and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this session , fut@@ ures trading will only give a probability of 25 percent .
&quot; in our study all the increases cycles from 1950 to date have taken place in a super cycle with increasing GDP and pre @-@ rec@@ essi@@ on@@ tro@@ t very quickly after the start of recovery in the shadows , &quot; says the report .
in contrast , this is clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest which has waited for the last recession since the end of the last recession , and the record was 35 months , and so far 74 months .
the firm income was also vol@@ at@@ ile , as the market is growing a interest rate , and the pattern is rather similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than shares , if they change their strategic course .
upon bonds , the returns seem to change once the first increase / reduction in cycle is carried out .
at the end of the increases cycle , the bond tra@@ des fell immediately , said the Deutsche Bank .
the strateg@@ ist of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the increase in interest rates will result in a longer and shorter bond due to a bend in the curve .
high @-@ quality bonds often bring better yields , although &quot; we are still c@@ auti@@ ous to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come @-@ Analy@@ st at Schw@@ ab , in an analysis .
interesting is that Jones comments that markets have already adapted to F@@ ed @-@ Strategy expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; besides the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation expectations , there are some evidence that the market has adapted to strict monetary policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the yield curve is shallow , l@@ apping has expanded and the vol@@ at@@ ility increased - all features of the market when the F@@ ed exac@@ erb@@ ated its strategy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the large and whole company , firms that have a larger part of its business activities in the United States , benefit from increasing interest rates and more attractive to local products . &quot; &quot; &quot;
multin@@ ational companies with high debts will allow worse offen@@ ders , as an increasing US dollar makes their products more expensive and the financing of their debt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; history shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares are pr@@ one to react just three months after an initial interest rate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts also said in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with strong balance sheet enabled companies with a low balance sheet , after each of the 1994 , 1999 and 2004 , by 5 percentage points .
companies with high capital yield as well as low vol@@ at@@ ility as well as low vol@@ at@@ ility against their shares , also exceeded their counter@@ parts by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) , and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts are a big problem .
companies with a high proportion of flexible interest will most lose , Gold@@ man said .
outside the real share of stock , consumers will also benefit from the rising bu@@ cks .
savings can see gains by higher yields , even if experts are different , how fast that will take place .
BBC Radio 3 , a copy of the Classic FM , says MP Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Parliament &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Con@@ servative Party &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; critic@@ ized the broad@@ c@@ aster because of its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he argu@@ ed that he is not to be distinguished from commercial ri@@ vals .
he was also target@@ ing the BBC Music Awards and said that they only im@@ ited The Br@@ its
group colleague Dam@@ ien Collins gave the mission The Voice to and said that this was not very original .
&quot; &quot; &quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too Classic FM &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says a leading member of the Parliament and raised new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does not do something which does the private sender . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the con@@ serv@@ atives of Andrew B@@ ingham said also the BBC @-@ bos@@ ses that the public broad@@ c@@ aster &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ev@@ apor@@ ate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer be distinguished from its commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I &apos;m not using the word &quot; dum@@ b &quot; - but it seems to turn into Classic FM &quot; he said .
he was also targeted at the BBC Music Awards , launched in December .
the BBC Music Awards , launched last year , seem to be just under a different name .
so , if you &apos;re trying to do something else - these are two spontaneous examples of which you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said .
BBC @-@ General Director rejected the accus@@ ations and argu@@ ed that BBC Radio 3 goes well ahead of its commercial compet@@ itor when it comes to public live music and clari@@ fication of the public .
what I &apos;m learning about Radio 3 , I don &apos;t want to learn about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music , which really is un@@ matched .
&quot; and to give thanks to the engagement of Radio 3 , new music and to give new works on behalf , I really think , &quot; he said .
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argu@@ ed that tou@@ gh@@ ten has worked hard to engage the audience as it did in the past because the British informed less of classical music .
radio 3 was not the only element of BBC manufacturing , but during the hearing in the committee on the selection of culture , media , and sports on fire , making commercial ri@@ vals to tre@@ ad on the feet .
the T@@ ory @-@ MP Dam@@ ien Collins handle the Voice - the musical talent show of BBC , that was bought by the Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for the estimated cost of £ 22 million .
do you see why this programme is often deb@@ ated because it is not original and not notable ?
Lord Hall insist@@ ed on BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as a judge - &quot; on special BBC @-@ ways . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that the company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I find a hit from our in @-@ house barn &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it starts next time an entertainment series . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to exclu@@ de the order from other rows of The Voice in the future , or give money to other maintenance formats .
net sales in August at the slow@@ est and the Black Friday may be responsible for this
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
in the past month there was the lowest result since the records in 2000 .
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones to buy
experts believe that the Black Friday has slow@@ ed in November in November .
for over a decade , the virtual shopping is drilled , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets are transformed into ghost cities .
yet experts say that there are now signs that the online sales are stag@@ nat@@ ing after new numbers showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the records in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say that there are signs that online sales were stag@@ n@@ ated after new figures showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , that has always been developed over time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ R@@ G selling complex to the Guardian . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he stated that the online sales increased three years ago , as a buyer began to make shopping with their mobile phones .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now it comm@@ utes a thing , and we may possibly experience that growth decre@@ ases .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon , imported from America , is cited as a reason for sub@@ las@@ hing turnover .
experts believe that buyers will hold their purchases in front of this event , held on the last Friday in November .
last year Sch@@ arte five times the average number of buyers to make their computer to make their bar@@ gain , and some distribut@@ ors sub@@ contrac@@ ted .
experts believe that Black Friday in which the buyer fought against bar@@ gain , buyers could stop doing purchases .
a study by the British Ret@@ ail Con@@ sortium found that from £ 5 spending money has been issued slightly more than £ 1 .
in some products such as tel@@ ev@@ isions and washing machines , more than one @-@ third of shopping are now carried out via web @-@ shops .
at the same time , more than one quarter of the people buy clothes and shoes online instead of the fashion chains in the city .
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca near the crane accident f@@ atal@@ ities - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the bodies of 29 deaths are carried by Muslims in the first bur@@ ial products in Mec@@ ca by the streets
Saudi Arabia determines the collapse of the huge Saudi Bin Laden Group
the Ministry of Health said that altogether 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane had pl@@ ung@@ ed
hundreds of Muslims gathered , when 29 of the victims were gathered through the streets to bury the victims , when a crane had been killed in Mec@@ ca &apos;s wholesale fish .

the memorial proc@@ ession passed on to the Holy Place where only days before a building cro@@ oked by the ceiling of the mosque and then pl@@ ung@@ ed onto the bed .
the bodies were released for bur@@ ial , as the Saudi @-@ king over the building company by the Ben Laden was charged with the catastrophe , which also left 3@@ 94 leaving a san@@ ction .
the bodies of 29 operators who were killed when a crane thrown by the Great central mo@@ p of Mec@@ ca , were carried through the streets .
among the dead , Q@@ as@@ im Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children , who was on his first pilgrimage , was ski@@ pped as the crane .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents at the beginning of the yearly H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officials have already confirmed that the H@@ add@@ sch to Mec@@ ca with thousands who continue to come to town will continue to go on .
today , King Sal@@ man , the Bin Laden Group , had not managed to stop the crane of the crane when he was not used .
an Arab version of decree that was published by the state Saudi Press Agency , said that the Bin Laden Group was responsible for the collapse .
the English @-@ speaking service of the news agency did not tell this detail , but said that the company &apos;s leadership is forbidden .
at the beginning of this week Sal@@ man revealed to reveal what the fall of the crane caused , that fell into a courtyard of the big mo@@ p , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims fle@@ dged in front of the h@@ add@@ ling that occurred later this month .
the Bin Laden Group had no statements on the collapse of the Kran@@ s , and their representatives were not available for an opinion .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also imp@@ acted the group because of its current security measures and because they did not collabor@@ ate with meteor@@ ologist .
dozens of cranes surround the Mec@@ ca &apos;s big mo@@ p as part of the massive construction project , managed by the Bin Laden Group .
for decades , the Ben Laden family has been connected with the ruler of Saudi Arabia and takes over major construction projects .
the dec@@ eased leader of Al Qaeda , Osama bin Laden was a S@@ elected son who was originally designed by the family in the 1990s .
the crash of the crane arrived in a strong winds and rain , only a few days before arrival of millions in the Kingdom of Pil@@ gri@@ m &apos;s pilgrimage , which is at least once in the life of any healthy Muslims .
officials said that 158 people remain in the hospital .
government officials ordered that 1 million R@@ ial ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) to the members of the f@@ atal@@ ities and the same sum of the last remaining .
other injured receive half of this amount .
B &amp; Q Boss says that the period of cheap East European craftsmen is over
Brit@@ ons increasingly employ crafts@@ man , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe was rising behind
this leads to 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , which aim at cra@@ ft@@ spe@@ ople to be opened .
at the same time King@@ fis@@ her 60 B &amp; Q sales points nationwide
by Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City boss @-@ correspon@@ dent in the Daily Mail
it is claimed that Brit@@ ons carry out their hamm@@ ers and brushes in favor of the use of qualified employees who carry out their work in their home .
if you are sk@@ ill@@ ful with a hammer or a brush to paint walls , it seems to be a minority .
for Britain increasingly employ art@@ is@@ ans to carry back home jobs in their homes , so the head of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , the new CEO of King@@ fis@@ her , who owns the Baum@@ gart@@ ner chain , said that a great rise in the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe offer the services to low prices .
thus , King@@ fis@@ her plans to open a further 200 @-@ shift shops , set up art@@ is@@ ans and make 60 sales units of B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten buying decisions in the store are met by women .
at the moment they were silent for the employees .
she said it was necessary to present the growing demo@@ graphic trends that show more female single @-@ households that carry out more renov@@ ations than in the past .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; there is still a majority of males in our branches .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to shift this path to a balance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
basically , half of our clients are made out of women with 80 percent of the decisions concerning the purchase of articles through women .
women play a big role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women on the top of a British in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 index , is also re@@ construc@@ ting its top team to reflect the same number of men and women in man@@ ag@@ erial positions .
King@@ F@@ isher is almost the only company owned by 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and managing director .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ F@@ isher gave a decline in half @-@ year gain and the sales , after the group decreased its cost to close the stores .

the Provin@@ cial Court Kl@@ agen@@ furt will have to answer two officials of the Austrian volleyball player A@@ I / DO@@ B because of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and restra@@ ined education .
the accused pleaded not guilty .
one of them was also charged for abuse of abuse .
he was acquitted of this accus@@ ation in May .
the current process has been ad@@ jour@@ ned .
according to the chief advis@@ er , Robert Ri@@ ffel , in the preliminary studies , had cryst@@ alli@@ zed that the accused were able to disp@@ ose of the United States from 2006 to 2011 , about which they were allowed in their functions , for private purposes .
he kills the damage of around 400@@ ,000 Euros .
the sports cars are also charged with financial tubes .
this fact was the president of the Schengen , Judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it should be negoti@@ ated at a later date .
for the sake of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence council that no organisation had been created at any time .
the sports func@@ tioned had been offset only for allowance and sport club , for which they had been operating from 1982 to 2011 , and in which they would have invested a lot of time and money , in 2001 around 600@@ ,000 sch@@ illings ( approx . 44@@ ,000 euros ) .
&quot; back then we stood in front of the situation : do we carry the club further or block us ? , &quot; one of the accused , on a sandwich service audit@@ or of the financial year .
with his colleague and co @-@ accused , he decided to take this task .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have shed the money , put our life insurance as safety at the bank &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said in the recording . &quot; &quot; &quot;
agreed with the association : you can manage the money freely , no debts can be made .
moreover , in compliance with the financial success , the payout of the allowance was decre@@ asing retro@@ actively until 1991 .
therefore , one part of the allowance is only years later , namely in 2003 , when a plus was paid on the account .
package and not detail bookings appeared , as well as described the former Ob@@ mann events .
the accounts and savings of the two accused jointly , said the second accused .
why the out@@ flow of the club had not been exposed in detail , the judge asked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association did not want to be interested in financial results , important to debt relief only , the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a function@@ ary investigation began in 2011 for minist@@ erial approval , an amount of EUR 120@@ ,000 was transferred to the association &apos;s account .
these were the accused , they declared the accused .
this securities account ran on the name of the second def@@ endants and was not known according to his statement .
&quot; why ? &quot; I wanted to know the judge .
that didn &apos;t know how long the answer was .
then he said finally , he believed that this was the best for the association .
if something happened to him , nobody had known anything from this money , the public prosec@@ utor was in the room .
the accused should be informed , justified by the function@@ ary .
this transfer was form@@ ulated as &quot; dem@@ nity of damage . &quot;
why does damage design know ? , judge and prosec@@ utor wanted to know .
the first accused pleaded not to have agreed with this phrase , because the society had never been a damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what shall I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You are all from Schneider . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; am I a representative ? &quot; he asked .
he also said the function@@ ary , he never made a cent content , he only anticip@@ ates mil@@ eage and di@@ ets .
on di@@ ets , he charged $ 1,000 per month per month , but the actual expenditure would have been much higher , he added .
accurate documents for early years could not show the accused .
these were after a working trial , where everything has been judged correctly , no longer have been preserved , explained them .
the second accused had arrived .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all surveys are in cash , so he had to drive from the place of international property to the Bank to Blei@@ burg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stated in his statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main hearing is continued on 23 September with a survey of witnesses .
Hewlett @-@ Packard Show@@ case another 30.000 jobs
in addition to the personnel reduction for three years , the Compu@@ Supp@@ ression has been build further jobs during the event of the company .
the positions in the US Compu@@ terri@@ esen Hewlett @-@ Packard ( HP ) no end .
as part of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to reduce the mining of 25.000 to 30.000 jobs in its corporate customers .
as a result , costs tot@@ aling EUR 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) will be saved by the company on Tuesday .
the move will lead to a special load of about $ 2.7 billion that will fall from the fourth quarter .
the size of 55@@ .000 jobs have not yet been completed for three years .
at the end of the fiscal year 2013 / 14 , HP employed some 30,000 employees at the end of the fiscal year 2013 / 14 .
the Hewlett @-@ Packard @-@ share introduced 2.3 percent .
the enlarged Group of California Palo Alto is currently on this way : thus , the computer and print business will be bund@@ led in a new company this year - separated from the reporting areas of computer servers and data security for companies as well as other providers .
both parts of business are listed on the stock exchange .
another disappoin@@ ting PC clau@@ se as well as a weaker demand from corporate clients after its services continued the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer to the most recently .
in the third quarter of July , sales of the PC and printers came back by 11.@@ 5 percent .
sales fell by 8 percent to almost 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
this reduces the proceeds in 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP is respon@@ ding with a break @-@ away and massive positions of change in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the management of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has only responded very late to customers to increase smart phones and tablets instead of conventional computers to get the business online .
Whit@@ mans re@@ signs plans to see a total of about 55@@ ,000 positions in total .
conflict : majority support the anti @-@ IS training mission
however , a direct involvement of German soldiers in Iraq would predominantly ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ate re@@ jection . 54 per cent spoke against it , 35 percent pointed out .
that other states fly air strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria , 61 percent will be positive .
24 percent of these are to be interven@@ ed in the conflict .
in cooperation with the Syrian Ara@@ th@@ ous Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad , 51 percent of respon@@ dents say 20 percent would be .
29 per cent could not decide .

until 27 September , the mass centre of the fair was connected , self @-@ prop@@ elled cars as well as electric mobility .
on Thursday , German Chancellor Angela Merkel will open the 6@@ 6th International Automobile Show under the slogan &quot; Mobility &quot; to open on Thursday .
the broad audience can visit the IAA from Saturday .

R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : Serbian Border ( Serbian Border )
the Hungarian police launched attacks on the Serbian border with R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ n@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and Wasser@@ ku@@ ppe for several hundred refugees .
Eur@@ one@@ ws @-@ correspon@@ dent D@@ án@@ iel Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the violent action on the border check@@ point .
he reported a telephone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
behind it a police pilot was formed and behind the police got a water designer ready .
40 to 50 refugees began t@@ oss with stones , impacts and plastic bottles after the civil servants .
the officers were initially im@@ interrupted without pepper spray .
after that , the police used Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as .
a lot of Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as was spra@@ yed in the direction of refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
the refugees have now with@@ drawn something unexpected .
a pregnant and apparently the last woman was removed from the zone .
children who met the Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as , cried .
other refugees joined in themselves and suffered under respir@@ atory .
the police spokes@@ men of the Serbian police also suffered injuries by using Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and pep@@ per@@ spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US emergency tank
the world was observed when the U.S. emergency tank comes to two days , Wednesday and Thursday , to make the key decision , for the first time since almost a decade , interest is to be raised or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists , who were survey@@ ed by Reuters , found that a little more than half , the F@@ ed would do this now , now think that the F@@ ed will remain somewhat longer and the interest rates will keep on its current level 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent .
it is a historical event because it has seven years since the F@@ ed interest earned on NULL .
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero margin and starts a process of norm@@ alisation of interest rates , &quot; angel U@@ bi@@ de , Head of Staff at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics , said .
the U.S. economy is based on a relatively good performance , tr@@ illion dollars will be added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation .
however the F@@ ed cannot ignore a proportion of global circumstances .
she has warned the markets to put an increase , but the signs indicate that chances of such a step are good .
the decision should be announced at 20.00 CET on Thursday
death of Death at Delta State University Reg@@ ulated A@@ pol@@ ation Dis@@ pos@@ ing
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the killing and killing his friend in Mississippi on Monday morning -- and before he later killed his colleagues , Sh@@ annon Lamb said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry about the first murder and wanted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he could make it happen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said authorities on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police in G@@ auti@@ er , Mississippi , said that Lamb , lecturer in geography and social science education at Delta State University , call the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Some@@ one had shot on someone , and someone killed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb told the staff of the emergency center that police sent to his home police officers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I enjoyed my wife yesterday evening , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he mentioned also that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house , but no one will distur@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but probably excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the c@@ aller of his name , but he did not give him .
Lamb has no explanation for his feet .
when police came into the scene they found Amy Pr@@ ent@@ ure , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 , said , &quot; I &apos;m sorry I could und@@ o it . &quot;
I loved Amy , and she &apos;s the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
after writing the notice , Lamb took 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , killing his own life on Monday night when police officers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite rep@@ or@@ tedly on Monday , the Lamb believed that Pr@@ ish@@ iss also had a relationship , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; authorities on Tuesday , there &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to a triangle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ ent@@ iss was discovered from Shawn O &apos; Ste@@ en , who said she had been married for about seven years as a &quot; good man . &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but left friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ ent@@ iss have had a daughter who is 19 and she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; destroyed &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that Pr@@ dump her daughter &quot; was absolutely best friends . &quot;
Pr@@ ent@@ iss has been working online from home , according to statement of Lin@@ s@@ day Kno@@ w@@ les , who was identified by Sun Herald as a close friend of Pr@@ ent@@ iss .
Kno@@ w@@ les said that Pr@@ ish@@ iss , who had a dog named light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; Kno@@ w@@ les said
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police said , Lamb used to call her at a certain time on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was not going to prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when police officers took him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later that night , Lamb took his car to the side , fled on foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
Lamb obtained a PhD degree from the Delta State University in spring 2015 , as a PhD degree on the university &apos;s website .

Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa builds the group
the Lufthansa is planning a large group of corporate real@@ ignment .
in the year , the Lufthansa group will save half a billion euros a year with a better organization .
at 150 of the world &apos;s worldwide exec@@ u@@ tives , group sales will cost the workplace .
with the pilot project there is still new negotiations .
Lufthansa is expanding its business structure and evalu@@ ates the cheaper Euro@@ wings .
the aim of real@@ ignment is a profit contribution of some 500 million Euros per year from cost and net sy@@ ner@@ gies , the airline issued on Wednesday .
among other things , there will be no liability for passenger business in the future .
the budget airline Euro@@ wings is to be developed as independent as possible .
in future , CEO Carsten Spo@@ hr will soon be responsible for Karl Ulrich shri@@ mp for Euro@@ wings .
the new record scores the meaning of Euro@@ wings , with which the Group will future compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet .
so far the organization of the 120 000 employees has been complex .
the airline operates under the roof of the Passage Air@@ line group , representing three @-@ quarters of the annual turnover of € 30 billion .
new negotiations with the pilots
on this Thursday , negotiations with the pilot Association ( VC ) should be resumed after the strike .
that divided the union with .
the topic of convers@@ ations should be the retirement schem@@ es for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; cockpit wants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; come quickly as possible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in one year with a predicted record result . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conflict between trade union and airline in recent months led to various strikes .
background is the savings concept &quot; Wings &quot; in addition to the trans@@ itional provision .
it predic@@ ts that the Lufthansa reaches the fight for competitors at the group &apos;s own budget , Euro@@ wings .

Luke Shaw by Manchester United can &apos;t play for over months due to double fra@@ cture
in the Champions League &apos;s defeat of Manchester , Luke Shaw was a double fra@@ cture of his right one at PS@@ V Eindhoven .
while this gave the left outside @-@ def@@ ender to tears and closing it for at least six months of playing , Louis van Ga@@ al will not give hope that Shaw can play back in this season .
the injury was caused by a rel@@ ent@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute , after the 20 year old Shaw collapsed in the PS@@ V area .
he was treated at the playground for nine minutes before he needed oxygen before he was put into hospital .
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has a double sheet of construction and lies in the hospital . &quot;
tomorrow or maybe one day later , he will be transferred and then operated in Manchester .
it &apos;s aw@@ ful - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United that &apos;s very hard and then plays fantastic and then this happens .
in the changing room he had an oxygen mask .
he cried .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double fra@@ cture , then it takes six months and will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to be a red card and the susp@@ ending of a mis@@ ery .
Nic@@ ola R@@ izz@@ oli , the arbit@@ er , has not punished the Mexican .
van Ga@@ al suspected that the Italian refer@@ ee had been wrong .
you can judge for yourself if I say that a meter and a red card were due .
it was a very worse attack with both legs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Twe@@ et to Sha@@ ws account &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words can &apos;t describe how broken I am , my way to recovery begins now , I &apos;m getting stronger back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Home : Manchester United re@@ suffer the loss of Luke Shaw at defeat in the PS@@ V
the UK @-@ def@@ ender has an additional inc@@ en@@ tive to recover in France up to the next June .
Phillip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V coach , said : &quot; it is a very bad injury . &quot;
if a player with this type of injury left the place , all are very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ as Holland @-@ Team during the World Cup 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to hurt your opponent , and if you hear that it is a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball , which was travelling in another direction , so it looked like he had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard it can be . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to the hospital - following a novel by Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely , David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
it &apos;s a thing that all parents soon learn : if your child loves a book it will not take long until you know it almost by heart .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child care systems to call his favorite kid &apos;s book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , which appeared in 1971 on Dr. Se@@ uss , 1971 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a tough choice , Cameron writes in news on the website of the company Super@@ camps , and continues : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it is a book that I love to give to my children , for it seems to always have missed an image or message that we have missed so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
everything nice and well , except for the next paragraph , in which Cameron is supposed to describe the action of the book , instead of re @-@ giving a sy@@ no@@ p@@ sis of the 2012 movie version , added the new characters and details to extend the quite brief original text .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; amid@@ st the w@@ alled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature went , and even the air a commodity is , hoping to see his desire to see a real tree , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reads , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reads . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name Theodor Se@@ uss Geis@@ el was wr@@ inkl@@ ed and died in 1991 , but completely unknown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; as if that would not seem to be suspic@@ ious , the text of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Movie Database &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reads : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the w@@ alled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where everything is arti@@ f@@ ici@@ ally and even the air a commodity is , hopes a boy named Ted , the heart of Audrey , wants to win the girl of his dreams . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although he wants to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems unlikely to be a prag@@ matic boy , like the local environment seems so little familiar , despite the protests of the nam@@ ing Lor@@ ax , a hollow @-@ stub@@ born creature , &quot; which speaks in the name of the trees , &quot; is rav@@ aged .
most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per , who did not read the Lor@@ ax for 20 times in a row .
a Down@@ ing Street @-@ Spe@@ aker said that the text was probably from Camer@@ ata presidential office .
Super@@ camps confirmed that the text of Camer@@ o@@ ons were delivered but there were no other direct comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the dism@@ iss@@ al of England &apos;s crew , but it &apos;s still difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to get to Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates , is a difficult task , but if one sees the Ka@@ der that England has chosen for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 Test series defeat is not on my map . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I wouldn &apos;t close another victory .
Al@@ ast@@ air C@@ ooks page may be less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin players in the Batt@@ ing list , and the common spirit is strong ; they will not bear any scars of 2012 , just a you@@ thful positive attitude .
with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali developed as a spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid even when he represents an unknown size on test level , is an option for the attack .
this message @-@ related message : Adam Ly@@ th returns from the United Kingdom @-@ Test @-@ cad@@ res and is replaced by Alex Hal@@ es .
the decision to allow Adam Ly@@ th is for me as his head coach in Yorkshire , difficult to analyze .
at its seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are targeted on results .
there were no question marks at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and this led to the nom@@ ination , since - and I told this before - players are their own best selection .
long time ago , one would have extended the run of Ly@@ th , but he had control over his own fate .
if he hopefully strikes other runs for Yorkshire , another chance arrives .
the England @-@ coach Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss praised his attitude , even if he didn &apos;t perform such good performances , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is especially a team man .
the question , how much time has been tested by a Test @-@ Schlag@@ mann , is difficult .
Ly@@ th received seven chances of winning Sam Rob@@ son ahead of him while Nick Comp@@ ton was nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and down@@ wards .
the only reproach that could rise was that England was first put in the Caribbean - when Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex Hal@@ es comes in and he is a drummer who I really appreciate .
he is an X @-@ factor Cri@@ quet player , which we saw in Yorkshire in this season when he took place 236 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which met us very much .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he must maintain at least the same opportunities as those before him , but this obviously depends on the team positions in the United Arab Emirates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea of leaving the one of Mo@@ een near Cook , giving it a more extra spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and got four Qu@@ icks , and I didn &apos;t do anything against it .
I don &apos;t see why a drummer is not able to beat there , and this left handed is already shown that he is an devil &apos;s sn@@ ail player .
Mo@@ een perhaps does not have his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for her , and there is no big difference .
my former te@@ amm@@ ate Justin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests before he appeared as an open@@ er in 2001 .
he made three hundred rein@@ for@@ ts immediately and did not look back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari is in the Ka@@ der as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited deal with him he has impressed me as a young man .
people may see his statistics on - average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think , it is a pun@@ t , but there is no big number of backup sp@@ inn@@ ers who raise their hands and the train@@ ers decided for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team , England made a few smart supplements at the train@@ ee .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ es , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as consultants for the trial could be a master coup .
he is one of the nic@@ est guy of the game that will bring an abundance of experience because he has played with all the conditions and against all the attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes to the white sphere stage of the tour and brings energy and powerful deployment in the setup .
I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can bring fresh air in the changing chamber , even if the messages are in harmony with the earlier steps .
Coll@@ &apos;s te@@ amm@@ ate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , won &apos;t be used at One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot was a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with that .
some will not agree , but co@@ aches and team cre@@ ators do not determine the schedule .
and you have to think about how players will depend on the results in players .
such decisions are not made to light heart .
the Bre@@ xit camp ( Bre@@ xit = precip@@ itation of Britain from the EU ) could be seen , if the economy is running into a f@@ lau@@ te in 2017
David Cameron un@@ initiated re @-@ negoti@@ ating strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting deeper into difficulties with every day , even without the choice of brilliant Jeremy &quot; Is It Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n for the Leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , which was torn apart from Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners have also their cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a European diplom@@ at told that some member states that are deeply mired in various crises such as the EU is now , and not always from own fault , Britain &apos;s self created agenda with split inf@@ alli@@ ances and b@@ other@@ ing contract changes that they usually don &apos;t want to be satisfied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Bri@@ ghton , the TU@@ C decided at the annual meeting that it does not like this , if they end@@ anger social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie &apos;s agenda .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prime Minister and Finance ministers go to summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capit@@ als , make a photo of itself in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , they come home and say that they were allies for reforms . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s all about me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my European friend who wishes to look outside the Great Britain within the EU @-@ tent - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s not leave us alone with France , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Berlin - and lets slip that there is no more short @-@ sigh@@ ted minister and civil servants in some capit@@ als until the point we don &apos;t matter whether we stay or going . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany &apos;s c@@ auti@@ ous Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally , but it has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the ministry , before it looks bad for it , like Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and cab@@ bage ( 16 ) .
French President François Hollande can look at his re@@ election or replacement in 2017 .
he is also a united force .
Poland could soon see a nation@@ alist government in Spain , Spain .
it is hard to imagine that they are going to get a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie Br@@ its to prevent the energy from the UK , from Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something that they don &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ at@@ ist ten@@ dencies have .
hence , perhaps some such ministers don &apos;t plan helpful comments , completely in the SN@@ P style , during the UK &apos;s referendum in 2017 to exp@@ ed@@ ite the Bre@@ xit process , my friend susp@@ ects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the negoti@@ ation was a ple@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; UK has won nothing of value from the negoti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Europeans know how East European Fle@@ et Street can be on its cost , and which EU scep@@ tics has won the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press embar@@ go as they did during the period of Tony Ben@@ ing inspired by Tony Ben@@ ch in 1973 , with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they can remember Boris Johnson , the ore @-@ euro opportun@@ ists , who made a name as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade ban@@ anas &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &apos;s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when all his de@@ vious she knew Ed Mili@@ band who were his enemies .
to do this , the Med@@ ley belonged to tax @-@ prin@@ c@@ aries , phone @-@ h@@ ack@@ ening ali@@ ens and the P@@ seudo non @-@ in@@ signia that most of our major newspapers possess .
actually Tony Bl@@ air thought similar to them , but firmly believed that when one sitting with a hot Gor@@ illa in a cage , one gets better ban@@ anas in order to di@@ stract him , instead of lunch and dinner .
in fact , mil@@ eage was more Bl@@ ai@@ ri@@ ans as a Bl@@ air himself when he refused to face the Constitution of the EU , for Bl@@ air had rejected the principle of the un@@ approved Constitution of the EU , which then was refused by French and Dutch voters in 2005 .
the press has never forgiven him .
but the nice Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n who gave me a friendly cl@@ aps on my back on Monday - I told him that he had no time to temp@@ t me for me - seems to repeat the boy@@ cott of boy@@ cott , boy@@ cott , boy@@ cott of the 80 &apos;s .
it may take time , but it must develop a co@@ her@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but surely with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ sofa has left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s official position in Europe is - I &apos;ll press it friendly - in development .
he says we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
now , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps are traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ ale tendency and the wild beasts of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism probably can say yes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A Ben@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on television this week , as the boy sc@@ out fought in him , do not admit that Cor@@ by@@ ns was a bad idea of provo@@ king John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell as a Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ anz@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he remembered the 70 @-@ s @-@ s , when his old father was silent on television , faithful to his Labour Cab@@ inet meetings without losing too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys Stru@@ ggle was even more attractive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but to fight , to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stay under all matters - Benn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what J@@ C told his comra@@ des and members after all reports on Monday evening &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
whatever the touching @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to con@@ vey - remember that he has even touched me - News discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all things in the Stru@@ del of Social Media , a ne@@ sting site of Par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is correct to give Cameron no freedom for Europe that allows him to keep lab@@ ours support in the case of reference , like Mc@@ Donn@@ ell it said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins certainly think so .
but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ l &apos;s fundamental ways of EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite Bel@@ ager@@ al economy , their anti @-@ capitalist era - is not only a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussions among left dis@@ si@@ dents , for whom the Nar@@ c@@ is@@ sm@@ us is a central basic principle of dog@@ matic disputes .
as with its am@@ big@@ u@@ ties to Nato , Tom Watson is fel@@ ong convinced that J@@ C will not have a campaign for leaving - foreign diplom@@ ats will be committed to trying to find in all a sense of its su@@ peri@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin continue to waste political capital - they have also mis@@ leading voters - to make conc@@ essions to the British , if it can all be poin@@ tless ?
the US are already quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory government in power , what was re@@ minded on Monday at the start of something that was called British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum .
experts critic@@ ise the public health report about e @-@ cigarettes
claims of a state @-@ financed fund , that E @-@ cigarettes are less harmful than smoking has originated from a meeting of 12 people , partly with links to the tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) entered into Lanc@@ et by critic@@ ise the evidence determined by the Public Health UK ( P@@ he ) in her report of e @-@ cigarettes .
he published the &quot; Primary Report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive check of evidence . &quot;
however , some researchers have put the power handling of the data and referred to the links between some experts and tobacco industry .
in the last month , an editorial in the Lanc@@ et Medical journal attacked the &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ arily wind@@ y basis &quot; on which he formed his most important conclusion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; two other researchers have written in BM@@ J and have asked whether the claims are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; built on stone or sand &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor for European Public Health on the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on pro@@ ving effectiveness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said that the public expects that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current best estimate is that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current best estimate is that e cigarettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on a detailed review of the evidence and modelling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , this statement is made up of a single meeting of 12 people who have been called to create a model for a multi@@ purpose decision analysis ( Multi @-@ Crit@@ eria Dec@@ ision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to result in their opinions on the damage of various nic@@ otine hal@@ f@@ ical products . the results of the meeting were summar@@ ized in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director was previously predicted by British American Tob@@ acco Are ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also signed the Refer@@ ences of BA@@ T for Public Health in a Sustainable Development Report , they said .
one of the 12 participants agreed to receive funding from an e @-@ cigarettes manufacturer , but not financing which he should have received Philip Morris International reports previously to reports from tobacco company Philip Morris International .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reasons for selecting the members of the body are not supplied , but these include several known e @-@ cigarettes champion , some of which also provide some sectors funding in the paper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some other participants in this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
at the meeting , the tobacco management of the P@@ he took part .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the research group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard evidence for most of the products in most criteria , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , no such connections or restrictions will be discussed in the P@@ he report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that the claims of P@@ he said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no evidence that E @-@ cigarettes as a way for smoking for children or non @-@ smokers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were premature . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , Director of Health and Well@@ being at P@@ he said that on the claims had been re@@ acted by BM@@ J .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ cigarettes are considerably less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies at his ad@@ diction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the evidence is near that the health risks of e @-@ cigarettes are minor compared to that , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects . &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ he has the clear duty to inform the public about what is documented and what not , especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers facing the tobacco .
nearly 800@@ 0,000 people die annually at a disease with respect to smoking , and smoking costs the national health system of € 2 billion per year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with clear advantages of current evidence that e @-@ cigarettes are not without risk , but only a fra@@ ction of the damage caused by smoking , we meet our national jurisdiction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
BBC to quit the East En@@ ders , &quot; says former boss of Channel 4
the former Chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals &quot; would share their right arms &quot; for hit shows like Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson told that the radio fee should be used to do the kind of programs that are not sent by other UK broad@@ c@@ aster .
he critic@@ ized the BBC that they are likely to be seen public broad@@ c@@ aster programs , which probably seen from a smaller audi@@ ences to the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals , such as BB@@ C4 .
after the BBC @-@ General Director , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson reported that he tried to get in touch with channel 4 for six years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs were commissioned or sends , which would also clearly be shown from subsidi@@ zing ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Johnson to the Higher Education Committee under its investigation on the future of BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to keep the radio fee , what I hold in or in the long term not for a good idea , its production should be at least on programmes that do not make or put on order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they send the Voice in a first class window , because they want to achieve a wide range of support for their future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea that nobody would show this is a joke , it is ridi@@ culous , of course it is non@@ sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax program is financed without funding without subsi@@ dies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is such a program , East@@ er@@ ders is another , ad@@ mit@@ tedly both individual productions .
to be honest , other channels would give their right arm .
I stri@@ ve to see how this should be public @-@ legal television .
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC at all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson , a entrepren@@ eur for series , led to Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 said that the BBC was to blame for the hunting of people who work there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the amb@@ itions of the people who work there , and because they believe that this is the best way to safegu@@ ard long @-@ term support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his comments on the most popular broad@@ casts of the BBC printing the back what the former director of Sky , Tony Ball , presented in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC shows were to sell like East@@ man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson told that the rather publicly @-@ legal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BB@@ C4 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; programs should not compete , but they carry out their tasks , and they can argue when they &apos;re on their seem@@ ing missions to justify 4 billion £ circular charges , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well , we &apos;ve created all these above programs that no one has seen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they put them in a time window , in which no one ever wanted to see .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the radio , Johnson told the committee : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value of this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course you think all we think that for £ 150 per year gets a great value , but for people who is for the 150 £ a lot of money , ask me if this is true because they do not consume much from the BBC .
the former sky@@ line and channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also said before the Committee on Tuesday , demanded that the BBC will check its Rei@@ th@@ ian mission , to educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , only little of the BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said that it should be 1 % of its TV production and 0.1 % in radio and Canada , an example should change this in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inform , clari@@ fy and enter@@ tain this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the question of partnerships , El@@ stein , BBC , said to do more in areas like the one of the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a hand@@ ful of television is shown , and with the commercial broadcasting alli@@ ances are shown to make everything available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ Genetics &apos; may control bra@@ in@@ ic cells by sound waves
the video shows how the nem@@ ato@@ des alter the direction in the moment in which they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound impul@@ ses .
scientists have bred worms with gene@@ tically modified nerve @-@ systems , which can be controlled by exhaust pipes .
the tiny Nem@@ ato@@ des alter the direction in the moment when they have heard with sound impul@@ ses which have heard for the human ear to be heard , ir@@ radi@@ ated .
the impul@@ ses work by switching off the Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on @-@ cells , which are gene@@ tically modified to wear the membrane channels , which react on ultrasound waves .
more about this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said that the worms showed the power of a new method , called son@@ o@@ genetics , where ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
S@@ re@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , said the Guardian that the method of one day could replace the depths of brain stimulation , an inv@@ as@@ sive process that gives electrical impul@@ ses to the brain of people to treat symptoms of Park@@ inson &apos;s disease .
wet cat@@ er@@ ers generally not respond to ultrasound , but Chal@@ ice test@@ ified that they were doing it when they were surrounded by a fluid with micro@@ scop@@ ic air bubbles .
the bubbles , he found out , rein@@ for@@ cing the ultr@@ asonic waves , penet@@ rate into worms .
the intensi@@ fied ultr@@ asonic waves act on structures that are called the TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and in the membran@@ es of some of the worms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sound waves beat the opening of these ion@@ als and activate the cells where they are allocated , such a report Nature Communications . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to create ultrasound @-@ controlled Nem@@ ato@@ des , the worms changed the worms that some of their mot@@ ions TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels are wearing .
when he turns ultrasound to the changed creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ pu@@ ffs and transm@@ itting into the worms where they turn on the changed mot@@ ions .
the procedure has some simil@@ ar@@ ities with op@@ to@@ genetics , a ground@@ breaking tool that allows scientists to turn and off neur@@ ons with impul@@ ses of light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ Genetics could have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light , which has to be sent down on an optical fiber to the desired place in the brain , low @-@ frequency ultrasound tissue can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to susp@@ end the targeted human neur@@ ons for the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurolog@@ ical treatments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , added .

eight golden rules for living in student dormitories
eleven years ago I moved to a student residence in a student residence , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral relation , but only now , I remember the cl@@ amped sm@@ iles that I have anno@@ yed - and from many , long @-@ term complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be dist@@ illed in eight simple rules .
the entrance in student residence ranges from mild to fri@@ ghtening up to absolutely sc@@ ary .
it is temp@@ ting to tie in : people tell where you come from where you are taking sab@@ b@@ ness and why you have &quot; hon@@ estly said Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate , because in Ernst , guys , it is only a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it direc@@ ts the conversation and helps you to figure out the people that you might not speak with whom you wouldn &apos;t speak , even if your eyelashes were in the fire and these extingu@@ ishers would be .
leave people .
the people &apos;s rooms are often transformed into beverages , movie night venues and municipal gath@@ er@@ ings , but they are also places where people ti@@ gh@@ ten and their under@@ wear .
to be referred to : do not think about getting to the university with a relationship
intro@@ ver@@ ted , we obtain a rough handling of the university .
her room should be a refuge , but many student houses form a room @-@ to @-@ space @-@ stroll culture that can lead the friendly and socially and lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nothing in the culture allows you to say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I love you , and I want to go ahead , but you have to go away so that I get the energy back I used for the interaction with you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
feel to feel when a milit@@ one is exhausted from soci@@ alizing - and send it a SMS to take place .
ap@@ rop@@ os an@@ immersion : do it .
a guy in my student dormitories had the not@@ ion that a closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
to close friendship by baking .
since you start the university on the top of the back @-@ mania , the knock at the doors of people to introduce themselves with a plate of brow@@ nies , less strange than the welcome of the 1950 @-@ s . welcome to the neighborhood , I have something to bake you . so , now please smile when I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
home @-@ made treats offer is a good way to close friend@@ ships .
your room@@ mate feel oblig@@ ated to enter@@ tain himself and will , at the end , might associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are a constant b@@ aker .
po@@ or@@ ly mixed ra@@ gs of flour , sugar and fat make people sleeping when you knock .
steal food is a common crime in student homes .
of course , the cla@@ ws of chicken is a theft , but is it a drop of milk for your tea as well ?
check this with the milk owner .
chances are good that they are saying to control yourself , even if they are cooking in the inside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if one ste@@ als your things , this is annoying , and you have my compassion - but try to deal with it balanced than my room@@ mate , who added a det@@ erg@@ ent to her milk , to pun@@ ish th@@ ie@@ ves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she is now in prison .
they should make no noise , people withdraw from sleep or from work .
it &apos;s not just about being a decent person , but that you are in the tru@@ est sense of ad@@ ages to people sitting in the glas@@ sh@@ ouse .
a girl on my corridor asked their neighbors , whether to make them something , drum &amp; bass something quiet , because it had three o &apos;clock in the morning and she had a test in the morning .
they responded with even more loud music .
when she finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she sent her neighbours again to sleep two hours before they left their own music , shut up their door and went on to her three @-@ hour test .
would it not be romantic , if your future sp@@ ouse would go by chance in the same student residence ?
conver@@ sely , it would not be ab@@ ys@@ mal , if you have a room@@ mate for your future sp@@ ouse wishes to ran@@ ce , and will see them every day and perhaps experience how they over@@ ride all common friends ?
of course , heart is his own path - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future sp@@ ouse , try to talk about your sub@@ routine a little reason .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the exciting moment you notice that somebody will leave his keys in his non @-@ confin@@ ed room , the border is between a Ul@@ k and Mob@@ bing f@@ einer as it seems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a good hand is funny , but it only takes moments until it becomes bo@@ omer@@ ang .
spare by plug@@ ging a valuable and am@@ using lesson on safety - but do not che@@ w someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sh@@ ampoo .
close your door , and place your keys in a glass of water , which you then place in the freezer - but t@@ ack your owners on the blanket no more than twice .
town@@ houses for refugees , single @-@ looking , stra@@ ins serving
the real estate company Markus G@@ ild@@ ner builds in the Central Frank@@ ish corner of Rei@@ ki for people who don &apos;t have much money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus , for refugees , but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need living space , but also the mother and the Ger@@ ard ver@@ val@@ et . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I show , how one can still buy cheap and well @-@ built today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees are pushing for the housing markets .
the entrepren@@ eur Markus G@@ ild@@ ner believes to know how quickly cheaper living space can be created : he builds for refugees in a project holiday homes .
Mr. G@@ ild@@ ner , many refugees are pushing for the housing market .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus G@@ ild@@ ner : the mass housing in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
for people stay in a large part here .
given the refugee flow we also need sufficient housing in the coming decades .
a real , three @-@ storey house is the solution .
G@@ ild@@ ner : a terra@@ ced house takes the least place .
it facil@@ itates the integration .
this is different when people block people in blocks of homes .
each of the six houses built in the pilot project consists of three housing units for each four asylum seek@@ ers .
each residential unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a lounge .
it may be that many refugees say , it is peace , I go back .
then the houses can be rebuilt according to their needs .
how high are the cost ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : the price for 160 square meter space per house is in 184 000 Euros , without land .
that is man@@ age@@ able .
the construction lasted six months .
this is reasonable .
have the construction regulations complicated their plans ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : I maintained my project correctly .
especially complicated makes it always the dro@@ pping Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es value special structure and the plac@@ ment system .
gr@@ us@@ el@@ ig .
it will still be under@@ lined who creates three apartments in a row house , needs at least three pitches .
only in cities we lack the space .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did local residents react to their terra@@ ced house project ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : there were what they accused me of creating luxury houses for asylum seek@@ ers .
which is definitely not correct .
but do not exac@@ erb@@ ate your competition for affordable housing ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : it &apos;s true : we had a boom in Germany over the last five years , but luxury apartments were hardly able to afford .
my project has the message , also the normal people need living space .
not only refugees , but also the mother @-@ alone mother or the Ger@@ ard ver@@ val@@ et .
I am showing , as one can still buy cheap and well @-@ built today .
that &apos;s why it goes .

the new operating system can be requested by clicking on &quot; General &quot; and then select &quot; software update . &quot;
if it is ready , the phone will download the option to download and install it .
some are pushed forward after installation , as they get an error message indic@@ ating that the &quot; software update has failed . &quot;

Dr. Frank Müller conduc@@ ts the field of field breaks and is investing 3,@@ 10000 euros
Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ lows .
also , Sam@@ t@@ community @-@ mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , Economic Development in U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schw@@ artz and As@@ endor@@ ff &apos;s mayor Hein@@ fried cab@@ bert are also glad .
in many places on the country doctors - As@@ endorf said luck : there is Dr. Frank Müller on the 1st of October , the practice field breaks .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ris@@ ausen is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still on his side until his successor in the next few months .
after a reconstruction phase , Müller opens the surgery on October 12 again until then he invested € 3@@ 10000 in the premises at the St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us road 6 .
it was sympathy for the first glance , when Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll met , who currently compet@@ ed in the hospital at the same time and come into practice .
&quot; we always had in mind that the m@@ iller would fit into this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ fle@@ ausen and laughs .
&quot; when it was time I just called them . &quot;
the couple Müller pleased the idea of keeping her own practice in As@@ endorf .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact to the patient are very attractive for us , &quot; says 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller .
&quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families above the years . &quot;
as an advantage , he also , soon , will see his own boss .
and so we got stuck , the Mül@@ lers bought the house with practice .
they will continue to live in Bru@@ ch@@ ausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
there , two @-@ fold family father Frank Müller also grew up , followed by his medical studies in Hanover , as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently active as a Senior Physi@@ cian in Sul@@ ingen . he was appointed a management specialist in Die@@ ph@@ olz in 2009 , and is engaged to volunteer in the DR@@ K @-@ will@@ ingness of Bru@@ ch@@ ausen concentration .
from September 19 , the practice for the new boss will be prepared .
during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ ris@@ ausen has as a family physician , his wife is specialized in the gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ology .
the m@@ iller , two prisoners , want to settle down as family doctors .
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll .
after the conversion , the rooms will look modern .
we are offering more ultrasound examination as well as long @-@ term and loading EK@@ GS and need a talk room more .
the ED@@ V is also completely renewed .
a subsi@@ dy of 500@@ 00 Euro will get the Mül@@ lers under the support programme of the County ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) .
&quot; this shows how proud and glad we are convinced that the practice will continue , &quot; emphas@@ izes Sam@@ t@@ community Mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann .
according to Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , about 2,000 patients visit the field in practice , in the northern German average practice , it is about 500 .
in As@@ endorf there is another medical practice .
a positive side effect of the practice by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains the Ur@@ sel Fel@@ lows in As@@ endorf .
if no successor would have found , it would have gone .
those who visits the Mül@@ lers resp@@ . still look at all familiar faces : the seven medical staff and the cleaning of the field takes over .
with their departure at As@@ endorf an era ended , after all , the medical profession has practiced there for 30 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning , we had only two rooms , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Em@@ sel Fel@@ lows are re@@ minded . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they already felt a little bit of sad@@ ness after the long time .
&quot; but we continue to live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and are sure to see many patients often , &quot; says the Inter@@ ni@@ st@@ in .
her husband supplements : &quot; we have a 6000 square meter property . &quot;
&quot; so far I have always pressed myself to gardening and now it could be different . &quot;
the couple also loves two grand@@ chil@@ ds and travels .
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees through &quot;
&quot; the border controls are now sur@@ passed on to our southern border , &quot; said Minister lady Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner .
controls on the Hungarian border remain parallel to this .
however , it is clear that anyone who wants to ask for asylum would do that , of course , &quot; of course . &quot;
the primary care and safety of people are in the foreground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is clear , however , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people need to know that we don &apos;t accept the bound@@ less migration flows , even on the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border .
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia weighing up &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia denied
the Croatian government had communicated previously , and Slovenia would continue to leave for arriving refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany , and they also set up cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
but the Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ ger Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach , however , did not see this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy the boundaries of the border - especially towards Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the border with Croatia is already strongly controlled as the outside of the Schengen area .
as the Minister stressed , Sloven@@ ian wants to do its borders for refugees but not abri@@ dged .
&quot; every EU member must fill his obligations , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; stressed Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar .
as the Croatian government issued , the first refugees were tried in the night hours to Tuesday to travel to the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id in the border to escape the registration .
the Croatian police provided them in the near corn fields .
according to local media , police officers meet new refugees in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik .
it is mainly concerned with Syrians and Afghan women , including numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are also in use .
in the coming days his country expects about 4000 refugees , Minister of the Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
in addition , buses from Pre@@ se@@ vo are to the Maced@@ onian border , which had previously had mig@@ rated to the Hungarian border , Croatian and Serbian media reported on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the government in Belgrade stated that it was to suggest that people refuse to include certain routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neither can we , nor do we do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to media reports , in the morning a first bus with some 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id , during the day , other buses were expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria after Germany
the passengers were traveling through Serbia all night , from the 500 kilometers distant land of the Maced@@ onian border .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have heard that Hungary has made , so the police said we should come here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany , Slovenia and Austria .
this could now actually lead to a slightly north@@ western route for ob@@ servers in the far east route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary .
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive capabilities to border control &quot;
Croatia Minister of Interior , O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic emphas@@ ized that his country had prepared plans for the fall of a strong state of refugees for possible shooting situations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; details he did not name , but he pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive capabilities to border control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one perform tight controls in order to qualify for the membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , since the EU partners are consistently emplo@@ ying a good testimony to the country , which concerns the standard of border controls .
on Serbian side , roughly 300 refugees remain in place behind the Hungarian border @-@ fence .
according to the media reports , they had spent the past night at the border crossing hormone that leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two borders remain in Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g .
whether the remaining refugees trying to travel to the Croatian border is still un@@ clear .
Serbian Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic also tried on Wednesday morning at a local instant : he stops the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed , for the past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is currently not currently dealing with high number of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it can not be said if they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia , or another country .
hel@@ pers trust migrants to - dangerous - Alternative rou@@ gh@@ ten
though private Hungarian refugee flows have already begun to distribute the refugees land maps , where alternative routes are drawn through Croatia .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area there are also 20 years after the end of the Croatian war still un@@ cleared min@@ ef@@ ields .
on Wednesday afternoon the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clearance was sent to the border region .

the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hosp@@ itals made its 20th anniversary with this action and was thoroughly confron@@ ted with mixed reactions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s all about life , so we went to the heart right into the city and among the people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot;

therefore this public @-@ effective action was good for 20 year old .

F@@ ed@@ Ex earnings mixed , financial outlook for 2016 reduced
F@@ ed@@ Ex reported disappoin@@ ting results for the last quarter , and the Lie@@ fer @-@ Gig@@ ant hit its profit margin for a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its field service .
the company also said that she plans to hire approximately 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for their holidays .
at this date , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to set 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the share fell over 2.5 per cent at Pre@@ market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. &apos; s reported a profit of $ 10,@@ 40 and 10,@@ 90 $ in the financial year , which ends in May , 20 cents less than during previous forecast . &quot; &quot; &quot;
analysts expected according to a survey of Fac@@ t@@ set 10,@@ 84 $ .
the lower pro@@ spect , despite the price increases , amount to an average of 4.@@ 9 per cent , will be effective on 4 January and despite the increased volume of ground transport of heavy and large packages that will be collected from November .
the company said that , however , expect the result over the previous year due to cost reduction , higher income and growth in online stock market growth .
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company will deliver solid yields when considering the weaker economic conditions , especially in production and global trade . &quot;
the plans for vacation @-@ employment have been announced a day later than half of the rival UPS , plans to hire 9@@ 0,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , about the same amount as last year .
in the quarter , which ended on August 31 , F@@ ed@@ Ex had earned 6@@ 92 million $ , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share amounted to 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just beyond the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve of Z@@ acks Investment Research in@@ quired Anal@@ ysts .
sales increased by 5 percent to 12.2 billion $ .
the six of Z@@ acks were asked analysts expected to expect an expected 12.@@ 23 billion .
in recent years , F@@ ed@@ Ex has reported a drop in international priority shipping that brought the turnover in his unit Express @-@ shipping to stag@@ nat@@ ing .
but the boom in online shopping has improved the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter sales increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for greater packages and self insurance .
the Express unit recorded higher payments due to higher prices , while the result is falling due to higher labour costs in the freight business .
in Pre@@ market trading , about one hour before opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares increased by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to € 15@@ 0,15 .
on Tuesday they closed down with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
on the most expected conference of the year , Federal Reserve St@@ ate@@ es spend two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot @-@ ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table sitting in order to decide whether it is time for the first time since almost a decade to lift the Leit@@ z .
threat@@ ening over them at an end of the animated , two @-@ story sitting arms is a mur@@ al of the United States .
the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed chairman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the Central Bank has a double @-@ fold commission by Congress : maxim@@ ize US employment and prizes here .
but since the big recession , the F@@ ed leaders have recognized that there is an un@@ driven third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too tight to pre@@ dict it . it will be announced on Thursday if the US economy is ready to we@@ aken by the un@@ preced@@ ented inc@@ en@@ tive inc@@ en@@ tive by the near @-@ standing short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most data of the economy show that it grows solid , the recent turbul@@ ence on the global financial markets could make more careful F@@ ed representatives to rein@@ force this vol@@ at@@ ility due to the rise of interest for Bundes@@ an@@ bonds - and also it is just one quarter percentage point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apparently the labour market and inflation is primarily the most important to see what they are watching , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pie@@ g@@ za , Head of Women at the Mak@@ ler@@ company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think when they were looking for a pre@@ text , to increase the interest rate , increased in@@ security is enough to wait around the global market enough , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no con@@ sens@@ us about what the F@@ ed is doing is uns@@ ure the financial market .
about half of the econom@@ ists , recently inter@@ viewed by Bloom@@ berg , have predicted a Zin@@ c line this week .
the financial markets , however , expect a wait for the F@@ ed , with a key indic@@ ative , which indicates a 30 % chance of raising .
this indicates a drop in the stock market , in case the F@@ ed increases the sentence , unless the Str@@ ate@@ ur@@ ges alle@@ vi@@ ate the strike by promising a further increase .
the Dow Jones Industrial scores rose by 22@@ 8,@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16.@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 on Tuesday .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy maintained the sentence in this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Che@@ st@@ kon@@ om at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise when the F@@ ed would raise the phrases at that time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if they do it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would have to go very far in their declaration to calm the financial markets so that they may not panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argu@@ ed that a interest rate would calm down the financial markets as the F@@ ed would take up when the F@@ ed would take away .
yet a month ago , the F@@ ed seemed to increase the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percentage points per month , the first small step in a slow ti@@ ghtening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen had said in the spring and in the early summer , that in spite of the dis@@ comforts of liber@@ als that more economic progress would be needed to expect more economic progress .
although the creation of employment in August slow@@ ed down , the improvement on the labour market this year was solid .
the unemployment rate declined to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for over seven years and in the vicinity of levels to see the F@@ ed as full @-@ employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation was steadily under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason is the temporary impact of significantly lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can cope with higher interest rates and needs them because of tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian Shepher@@ d@@ son , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the financial markets of the whole world came together in the end of the last month after China had dev@@ alu@@ ed its currency .
the Dow Jones Sustainability average value fell by more than 16 % among its highest levels , as investors were concerned that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would imp@@ ly global growth .
the market has recovered somewhat in this month , the Dow Jones is now nearly 10 % below the peak of May .
for F@@ ed Repres@@ ent@@ atives , the market turbul@@ ence influence the complex calculation where you should increase interest .
&quot; if the events did not have occurred on the financial markets and the news on the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks , in this session , Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low on U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and former staff members of the U.S. emergency tank .
now he predic@@ ts that she will be waiting for at least one month in order to get the effects better .
&quot; there is a lot of un@@ certainty about what impacts on the US economy , and there is almost no reliable data that describe developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner .
the global economy is none of the key factors of the F@@ ed , so they should not be included in their decision @-@ making .
but in the end the F@@ ed currency in the world has become .
the impact of the central bank was enormous in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the mere statement from the former Director Ben S. Bern@@ an@@ ke in 2013 that the F@@ ed could become &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nar@@ row@@ ly expansion &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; dis@@ b@@ anded by the globe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ woven , they can not only monitor the developments at another site , but also with other central banks and experts , to improve a better understanding of global economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; their decision @-@ making is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more arts than science , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Zach@@ ary Karab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management of company En@@ cap@@ net Inc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jeffrey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , marked this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of transition to financial market movements , which apparently doesn &apos;t seem to be associated with economic foundations . &quot;
L@@ acker , voted member of the Federal Open Market Committee , set up for a Zin@@ c increase , cited decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought F@@ ed to reduce their conduc@@ tivity at 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite limit@@ ated apparent impact on growth in the U.S. , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ acker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a year later the F@@ ed Repres@@ ent@@ atives successfully revers@@ ed these cuts .
the F@@ ed should put out aspects of financial stability during a serious crisis as the first crisis in 2008 , Adam S. Pos@@ en said a former member of the Committee on the Bank of England .
the youngest turbul@@ ence do not come close to this level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will certainly not get to the situation in which they are afraid of a Zin@@ c level , because the markets are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poses &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; poses , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until it is altered , I do not believe that they should pre@@ dict the time .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small health aid for refugees
these days more refugees arrive in Germany .
to prepare a warm welcome , not without the commitment of countless volunteers .
there are also a number of people in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da , supporting an un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seek@@ ers in the city .
among them Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher and soul teacher .
she still enjoys their 74 hand@@ leb@@ ars .
every Thursday she does in the asylum seek@@ ers in the D@@ ill@@ inger Street .
it helps refugees from Syria , Kurdistan , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German language .
of course , it &apos;s different classes than at a proper school .
Brazilian p@@ ä@@ di@@ at@@ ric society Rio Grande promotes food for healthy st@@ akes
the Brazilian p@@ ä@@ at@@ ric organisation SP@@ RS tries to shed women on a sho@@ cking manner how important good diet is during a lac@@ tation . she is doing it with the presentation of images of babies that are painted on breasts that are painted with depic@@ tions of un@@ healthy food .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates , who need all the nutrients that they need to build a strong immune system .
because of the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers get their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research results indicate that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only di@@ fe@@ tic adaptation that mothers should make .
a recent study conducted under the direction of Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas showed that a healthy diet is actually pregnant women and protects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ors .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can affect the immune system negative .
made for the new Bern@@ rie@@ der Spor@@ hall
the council of Bern@@ ried approved the building contract for the 2.3 million euro expensive gym .
and he made an exception .
the roof should be fl@@ atter for solar installation .
the planning for the long @-@ looking gy@@ ro@@ phy on the Bern@@ rie@@ der Sport@@ ing come step forward by step : in the most recent joint meeting the extended building contract was blessed without large discussions .
prior to this , the panel , among other things , had decided to be a legal basis for &quot; respec@@ tive &quot; liberation &quot; from the valid plan of development .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was for a special form regarding the roof construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to that , a &quot; saddle roof with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saddle roof should be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should be built &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; background of the planning is the intended use of the roof space for solar energy systems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , we get a wonderfully large south roof together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in turn left the roof inc@@ lin@@ ation for energetic reasons - differently than in the development plan sti@@ pul@@ ated - below ten degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this will significantly reduce the volume of the hall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because of the development plan no &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; permitted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the Am@@ rie@@ der municipal council is usually restric@@ tively talking to the liberation of liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , here is no recur@@ ring project : &quot; we do not create a process of preced@@ ents , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger .
gymn@@ asium of the Sports Center is a community project of the municipality and S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
some 2.3 million euros have been calculated at the cost .
grants are expected from school and lat@@ itude .
in the next case , the building contract for the 18 x 36 meters will now be submitted to the landing stage .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg draws to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital is supposed to be closed earlier than planned - namely in 2016 .
at the same time Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) became a new medical director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
the station and the majority of the employees move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this shows the surprising plans of the Hospital GmbH of the Land@@ kreis , which confirmed the Land@@ r@@ ät@@ in Andrea Jo@@ chner @-@ white .
however , a decision on this will meet the Supervisory Board , and the t@@ amper on Wednesday , 23 September .
if the plans are to be implemented , all of the nearly 50 employees would continue to work at the Hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the vast majority should be dra@@ gged along with fishermen and the far@@ ther distance to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are present .
the employees who cannot go to Sch@@ ong@@ au is to be offered a job in We@@ il@@ heim , so Jo@@ chner @-@ white .
the employees are informed of the plans .
triggered by the change of termination by Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who is , until the beginning of the year , medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer clinic , and now changes to a private practice in close proximity of the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the question , who should take over the succession , according to Jo@@ chner @-@ white , the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fishermen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came into play , who was willing to take over and take control of his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au as of October 1 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this means a &quot; dev@@ alu@@ ation &quot; and a spread of the bid in the field of Internal Medicine , &quot; says Jo@@ chner @-@ White .
fis@@ her is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fibr@@ ill@@ ators .
S@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialised on the internal station on gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
through the course of the next two years , Fischer with his team , when the Supervisory Board is entitled to agree both houses , until then the former hospital of the scar@@ city , which has more than 35 beds , will finally be finally closed after almost 140 years .
until now , the county had been planned for 2018 when the ongoing renovation of the We@@ il@@ heim hospital is completed .
the Jo@@ chner @-@ White Land@@ r@@ ät@@ in Jo@@ chner @-@ White , which is also Chairman of the Supervisory Board , joined odo@@ urs , what the house that owns property will be used in the future as accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I clas@@ p it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how it continues with the property , Jo@@ chner @-@ White couldn &apos;t say , there are several consider@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a short term care of Car@@ itas and a Tag@@ esp@@ sy@@ chiat@@ ry are accommod@@ ated there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better could not happen , such an opportunity does not come back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fis@@ her about the quasi @-@ moving to the Le@@ ch , who had been positively received by the employees &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and very understand@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real perspective for the house where Fischer has been working as che@@ ologists for over 30 years .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take charge of the medical director .
the Hospital P@@ ei@@ pour berg ( once 100 beds ) was threatened by closure , and departments were closed , and departments were closed , for example the surgery and obst@@ et@@ rics .

Jag@@ ath with two ver@@ nissage at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers had been seriously viol@@ ated during their maize harvest@@ ed afternoon by shots .
during the surg@@ eries on a maize field at Pr@@ at@@ au ( district Witt@@ enberg ) several fighters were using how the police dealt .
a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injury and were brought to hospital .
how it could happen to the accident , initially , was un@@ clear .
the det@@ ective police is determined .
missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate victim of violence crimes
a crime fiction has led the police to the cor@@ p@@ se of the 16 @-@ year @-@ olds , out of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate .
in the inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old gave the young people killed and her bodies were thrown into a channel in Rock@@ en@@ hausen .
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate missed an ill break for victims .
the young woman &apos;s cor@@ p@@ se was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ en@@ hausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as announced the public prosec@@ utor and police on Wednesday .
he was also suspected of a twenty @-@ year @-@ old associate , who , in fact , captured the indication of it and led the investig@@ ator for the place of discovery .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was reported missing on Sunday morning after having had not been out@@ dated after a visit to the festival in Rock@@ en@@ hausen on Sunday evening .
in search of a young woman , investig@@ ators first met personal objects at the victim &apos;s personal bel@@ ong@@ ings .
question@@ ings of the friends and acquain@@ t@@ ance of the mis@@ ses revealed themselves to a crime against the 20 year old .
the alleged perpet@@ rators then led the police to a canal in Rock@@ en@@ hausen , where the bodies were found .
according to the arrest , the authorities were killed in a police stop which killed 16 @-@ year @-@ old and have put the cor@@ p@@ ses in the canal .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old was to be demonstrated on Wednesday the port of the port , investig@@ ating the investig@@ ators .
by the close circumstances , the further investigations are to be carried out .
refugees need accommodations : study warns of housing
the location on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
even more refugees are looking for a paid residence .
the pressure on the residential market is growing .
the social housing is facing a challenge .
the distribution practices on the German housing market have long since begun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the upcoming refugees and seeking out of the EU , more people push for a market that has already over@@ loaded in many cities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they compete with low @-@ income citizens about the last affordable housing .
in order to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built up to 2020 .
the result is a study on behalf of the association &quot; social housing . &quot;
for comparison : this year 26@@ 0@@ .000 units are finished in Germany .
therefore 14@@ 0,000 apartments are missing .
refugees are no longer obliged to live in the first three months of their stay as asylum seek@@ ers in an accommodation event .
many of them fall on the housing market and lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the rental apartments .
according to Statist@@ ical Federal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers lived in the last year .
however , the negative development of the residential market is not only in the increasing number of refugees .
the study also provides significant potential fail@@ ures in the residential construction policy of the last years .
Germany is getting a housing deficit before it gets stronger from year to year .
at present , Matthias Günther , author of the study , has already been missing in the metrop@@ olitan areas .
many professionals lived in large @-@ scale assets in WG @-@ rooms .
young adults remained voluntarily in the &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; because of the f@@ lau@@ ts on the housing market .
in the large cities , the number of square metres per capita in the years has declined for the first time in the past years .
to solve the problem , the association &quot; Social residential construction &apos; proposes a re@@ boot .
new inc@@ enti@@ ves to stim@@ ulate the social housing a new inc@@ enti@@ ves .
thus , the under@@ mine tax could be refra@@ ined and exposed the basic income tax for funded dwellings .
according to the Alliance , attractive tax de@@ preci@@ ation possibilities are necessary .
the programme for refugee camps of the state bank K@@ Kf@@ W is already well located in cities and mun@@ icipalities .
a good week after the launch , 184 million Euros were already being sum@@ mon@@ ed at € 184 million on Monday evening .
now the project could even be exposed .
refugees have free population : Croatia and Slovenia set up
to Hungary , practically no more can go through there , more refugees always pick up the way across Croatia .
Zagreb is announ@@ cing the transit of flights over Slovenia to the north without a hur@@ dle .
but the route is dangerous yet .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia over the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I talked with Sloven@@ ian interior ministers and when it is necessary we will organise a corridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Croatian Ministry of Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia is situated between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area .
the EU country Croatia is not a Schengen country .
after the isolation of the Serbian border , hundreds of refugees dropped to Croatia to travel from there to Western Europe .
500 people have entered the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , the Croatian television channel RTL reports .
Hungary had blocked his border for refugees on the day before .
new laws , which came into force on the same day , make ob@@ sol@@ ete extraordinary general asylum procedures in Hungary .
Croatia wants to let refugees pass through .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Mil@@ ano@@ vic declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can go through and we prepare ourselves for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and want to achieve something .
it , however , were people who didn &apos;t want to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police on the morning had taken the first refugees on Serbia &apos;s border to the EU neighbourhood of Croatia .
most of these media reports according to Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came both by bus and taxi to the Serbian border town of S@@ id .
immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to reach on foot via the green border to Croatia .
at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees cannot reach the border .
this tri@@ ples other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ v civil war in the 1990s .
de@@ mining services will now quickly create a secure passage .
after Hungary , no more refugees arrive after the closure of the border .
the police attracted 366 times on Tuesday .
shortly before joining the end , it was still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws ass@@ umes the over@@ coming and damage of the border region as an off@@ ense .
therefore 35 criminal proceedings were subsequently initiated in the southern Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
the convicted sentences thre@@ aten up to five years and the deportation from the country .
according to the Immig@@ ration Authority , a total of 94 asylum seek@@ ers was received on Tuesday in the newly appointed &quot; Trans@@ itz@@ oning &quot; border , nearly all of them - 93 - the main transition R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
among the applicants were 13 families with small children and two older people .
on Wednesday morning there were 40 refugees .
practically , nobody has granted any pro@@ spect of granted asylum in Hungary .
following a Hungarian political view , Serbia is a &quot; safe third country . &quot;
the exp@@ ired asylum seek@@ ers should be deported there .
only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the &quot; Trans@@ itz@@ one &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
workers started to break up workers in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
they gathered the rub@@ b@@ ish , which tens of thousands of people left behind the road@@ side in recent weeks .
plywood are dismant@@ led , and one of the recording bearings in the border was rebuilt .
nobody wanted to express itself to the goal of this Umb@@ ria .
after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria is only a few refugees .
the country has also reinforced its border controls .
but about the 20,000 migrants were still hiding in the country .
in Salzburg approximately 1400 people are waiting for the further drive to Germany .
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped by the German authorities in the morning .
in Freil@@ assing a regularly smaller groups of refugees met on foot .
mayor drove &quot; stran@@ ded &quot; over the border
&quot; we were busy after the bridge on Sunday with the premises , when ten people with rice employees stood at the entrance of the tent , &quot; says W@@ ern@@ st@@ eins , Alois Stad@@ ler .
tourists , they wanted to navigate with the train to Pass@@ au .
because Germany took a surprising way for the refugee with Austria on Sunday , but for them in W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s conclusion , so Stad@@ ler told his help and the money joined together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars on the border into the near Pass@@ au .
before we had the first trusted guests only once again , with lunch and drink .
we said the same , we bring them by car to Pass@@ au .
&quot; of course , &quot; it was a matter of course , &quot; as Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N chat .
they were very grateful .
a man didn &apos;t let it give you a generous donation - 100 euro for the fire brig@@ ade .
&quot; we were very pleased , &quot; Stad@@ ler told us .
the focused train pass@@ ers had switched on on Sunday night in Wels from an ICE in a regional train towards Pass@@ au , in order to be termin@@ ated in the short term that the railway was shifted to Germany but still on the border .
but the regional train was completed before the border in W@@ ern@@ stein am Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein , the border crossing is generally high in the course .
the bridge festival combined with the Bavarian neighbors on Sunday , previously a bi@@ ker run sporty - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Viktor Or@@ b@@ án now sends other en@@ ig@@ ures to us now , is a logical result of a seem@@ ingly bright policy : &quot; &quot; &quot;
instead of Camp R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke right away in the erection of structures that ensure Human@@ ity , our Chancellor , and publicly backed the attitude of the Hungarian government in the Nazis of National Socialism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bodies of these policy are not just those Austri@@ ans , who are now confron@@ ted in the boundary areas with cha@@ otic conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they will also have to find the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yellow country &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that invited them and welcome , nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a big challenge , in the face of persistent refugee flows and the coming winter , to produce decent conditions for protective devices . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it will be another major - peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad at the hunt for 35@@ ,000 winter@@ time sk@@ ul@@ ls
Konrad has to do with the refugee into all hands full .
Christian Konrad is known to have his word weight .
the government has used the former mighty Rai@@ ff@@ eisen bank@@ ers to place quarters for thousands of refugees .
finally , the chaos in the Tra@@ is@@ kirchen charter center , Konrad had already got a grip on .
&quot; we have no more homeless in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he told of his first success .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday will be without great work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad and sang the organis@@ ational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; master@@ y &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the Ministry of Interior spoke of a &quot; cra@@ ck situation . &quot;
a total of 8@@ 5.000 quar@@ ry in the he@@ ural year .
in order to meet the number , some 35@@ ,000 accommodations have to be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 should provide the other than 15,000 people .
should there be more refugees , we can do it .
&quot; but it &apos;s not a barrel without the ground , &quot; said Konrad .
he already managed talks with the Landes@@ haupt@@ mann .
they would have assured him , even to join the next refugees quarters .
&quot; in Ober@@ österreich builds it well , &quot; said Ferry Mai@@ er .
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , which should be clari@@ fied , as the church will help .
great expectations of the Asyl@@ um Coordin@@ ator also puts into the ORF action , &quot; Hel@@ ping as we . &quot;
on the platform we can offer un@@ friendly accommodations .
one hopes to be vac@@ ated in the winter , empty in winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and Mai@@ er critic@@ ized the standards for the accommodation as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in case of not@@ if@@ ications , it could not be that lo@@ dg@@ ings must maintain a certain height of the hand@@ tu@@ ch@@ holder , or the height of the colon@@ ists .

unlike the Ministry of the Interior , in contrast , Konrad at his experience is successful , he fo@@ unds Konrad with his experience .
I am an older gent@@ leman , who cannot tell the truth without further into the face .
persu@@ asi@@ veness is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Mai@@ er do not cause the Republic to explain how they declared themselves .
their number of employees wants to increase it three to four .
their own lo@@ dg@@ ings had not yet been successful yet .
Konrad wanted to establish a container at step@@ han@@ splatz in the office .
however , there are obviously problems with the permission .
Linz calls for a better separation
the city of Linz is not scheduled to opening the opening sports halls and other buildings , such as Tips @-@ Arena and Design Center for the accommodation of refugees .
this is not necessary , because it can now be subject to the person concerned without these measures , says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) .
further locations are to be checked for emergency in an emergency .
criticism of the city of the city by the division of refugees in the Federal State .
other areas have to contribute here .
See@@ hofer : &quot; borders will not be sealed . &quot;
in a longer phone with the Bavarian prime @-@ president Horst See@@ hofer ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) , held on Monday confirmed another procedure in the refugee question .
See@@ hofer has assured me that the German borders will not be sealed .
the continuing journey of refugees in the Federal Republic is still possible .
however , there is now the corresponding border controls .
there will be no more special trains with refugees in Germany .
the protective devices would , however , be brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the other EU member states asked for more increased solidarity in the refugee question once more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a logical consequence of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is derived from the anticip@@ ation of the German on its borders as well as Austria . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a question of time
the refurb@@ ishment of the &quot; New ship@@ yard &quot; in the Lin@@ zer industry line has been officially completed .
in four of the six store@@ ys of the office and production buildings , the listed IT Group S &amp; T is moved , the rest ( 2700 square meter ) is intended to be le@@ ased out of young , innovative companies from the technology area .
&quot; in IT , the smart heads are our commodity - and we need to try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T , Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er .
he could imagine to invest in start@@ up companies of the New Ship@@ yard , and later also to be acquired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - from the start , low @-@ in @-@ house benefits does : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a question of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
S &amp; T invested € 1.7 million in its location , 3.3 million euros were invested by the Tech@@ Center , which belongs to a third of the city of Linz , Austria , Upper Austria and the federal state ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is designed by Linz AG for 60 years to S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
30 percent of the 2700 square meter resi@@ dual area in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent give qu@@ eries .
L@@ ia @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ owner opened second business in the arcade
in the new shop Fur@@ la @-@ hand@@ bags are located .
actually Jutta has wanted to put a dog .
this project had to drag the 49 year old owner of L@@ ia Per@@ oni into the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ade : finally , it has now gained some additions in the form of an additional business location .
in the Fur@@ la shop , opposite the store , in which they are sold with bags , suitcase , shoes and clothing of different manufacturers , now everything around ladies hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are available from 75 euros .
large bags and accessories cost up to 500 Euro .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
she was converted several weeks earlier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but I have long wondered if I want to open a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said wide . &quot; &quot; &quot;
decisive factors for the decision was that also the Fur@@ la producers who are at home in Bologna , from the idea of a site , where only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only one in the greater area of Linz that sell this brand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters who has Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her fashion interest has put wide of her dam to the cra@@ dle .
I stum@@ bles at most , if something develops and I can show new trends at reasonable prices .
and why some woman looking for a lovely hand@@ bag in a ec@@ stasy , the professional woman can &apos;t answer the last security .
maybe it is because a beautiful bag is utilized by any outfit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ etter from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pf@@ äl@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose inhabitants &apos; inhabitants arrived .
this feature is also associated with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become the US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for pur@@ ification .
whether he speaks foreign host@@ ile , journalist or knowledge g@@ aps in the international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidential election s@@ wir@@ led the election campaign vig@@ or@@ ously .
and cuts well .
it is also registered in the Palat@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents are descendants of the real estate market .
many of the New Yor@@ kers with the F@@ öh@@ n@@ fr@@ is@@ ur is a concept for many in the Win@@ zer@@ dorf on the Wine Route .
man@@ cher in the 1200 inhabitants @-@ place is related to -@@ three corners with it .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Palat@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here at election campaign .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del shot a film about tr@@ ump .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about its goal , the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think they find that somehow exciting , but are not so deeply impressed by her K@@ all@@ u@@ stad@@ ter way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has made an am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous spro@@ uts in addition to Tr@@ ump also counts the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz .
Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes from &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) too , so in terms of saying that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he has not brought it to the king &apos;s heart .
although I give respect for the performance of the family , but also ten@@ ds the opinion that Tr@@ ump &quot; is &quot; a bit &quot; bit lazy &quot; - Wen@@ del says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; acci@@ dentally , the nickname &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Die Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - in German : the investors &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so Tr@@ ump is coming from the village of investors .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 1885 when the later grandfather immig@@ rated and in the USA a local for gold mines .
corn@@ erst@@ one of the property company were the first part of land in New York .
but the life of grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy . her wish to return to the Bavarian state , th@@ wart@@ ed by the Bavarian state to which the Pfalz were belonged then .
he did not record Tr@@ ump , because he once was dis@@ b@@ illed without hom@@ olog@@ ation , the director of the Institute for Pe@@ ace@@ ous History and Eth@@ no@@ graphy , Roland Paul , declared the film start .
tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal emig@@ rants . &quot;
that is in contrast to the rep@@ utable statements of the desc@@ endant .
he repeatedly claimed over Mexican immigrants in the U.S. and asked the construction of a boundary wall to put illegal immigrants .
&quot; as the pol@@ arity , this is not so symp@@ a@@ thetic , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative Tr@@ um@@ ps ( &quot; The O@@ ma was a native tro@@ mp@@ ump , the Op@@ a was born Heinz &quot; ) .
the win@@ emaker , retired , sees the American rather distant , &quot; he is always so di@@ ced . &quot;
does He believe that tr@@ ump happens ?
&quot; I cannot imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never took care of K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the pension manager Veron@@ ika Sch@@ ramm men@@ tions like some K@@ all@@ u@@ stad@@ ter , that a desc@@ endant of the family Heinz came to visit us for a visit to the church organ , which was generally good .
&quot; I cannot imagine that of Donald Duck , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they find it better if he won &apos;t won the choice , because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if it &apos;s good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had pl@@ agues in the USA at the time of his grandfather , would have been like him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ man Sarah Büh@@ ler .
and as President ?
&quot; I don &apos;t know my president , &quot; she says .
and : &quot; the grapes are ripe without the President Tr@@ ump . &quot;
W@@ end@@ &apos;s film , for the Tr@@ ump has been inter@@ viewed for a long time , have seen 12 000 Kin@@ og@@ ents , also in the USA w@@ akes interest .
the Bavarian community Ram@@ s@@ au in Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden is Germany &apos;s first &apos; mountain farm village &apos; .

Karl Stef@@ ano@@ vic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son hurry to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report about the loss of liber@@ als in the liber@@ als but it did not produce big shi@@ fts in the reviews for today .
the break@@ @-@ show of Nine was broad@@ cast@@ ed by the federal capital as Mal@@ col@@ m gym took the crash of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the Riv@@ ale Sunrise , with the hosts , David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , put in London as part of a week @-@ long series of international TV shows , of which also Dubai , New York , Ni@@ agara Falls and Canc@@ un belonged .
this dis@@ advantage of the insur@@ rection seemed to play no role for Australian TV spectators , since Sunrise scored 39@@ ,000 spectators at the five capit@@ als , compared to Today &apos;s 33@@ 9@@ ,000 .
today , a slight increase over the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number was lag@@ ged behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today , the gap to Sunrise has been closed in the last few months .
in August Today , Today reached an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 compared to the 3@@ 30,000 of Sunrise .
at the beginning of the year , the gap was between 40,000 and 50.000 .
so far in September sunrise is 34@@ 9@@ ,000 spectators at 3@@ 14@@ ,000 spectators at Today .
this is the most interesting , occurring every morning .
the winds of the change affect these Morgen@@ ers more than the Parliament !

the last three matches : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
mystery revealed ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki have obviously un@@ know@@ ingly who wins the Bachelor .
the woman , at which Sam Wood finally landed in The bach@@ elor , was covered in secret confi@@ denti@@ ality .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not be priced , whether they are the one that received the last rose .
but when we talked to Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows on the day before coming into three two , you may acci@@ dentally give a clu@@ e to who will be the winner .
Sam Wood stuck his lips up to the final on Thursday
all three women have left out in ly@@ rical ways , why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of hum@@ our , am@@ bition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they like to be his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the question is asked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If not you , who should W@@ oods last Rose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they could be their answers to the game that won the heart of the Bach@@ el@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called both quick - except himself - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood had a simple relationship with each other from the first day .
&quot; from the moment on when I went to the house and ( Sar@@ ah ) and Sam@@ s energies were re@@ marked , I felt that they were rather in@@ compatible , and I thought that they were throughout the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows .
&quot; Sarah stands on the ground with both feet on Earth , it is so much fun to be with her , &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added .
I saw them together , and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple .
from their point of view M@@ ack@@ ay said that the visit to the visit last week made it clear that Wood &quot; The One . &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and the family , it was clear to me that this is obviously not only a game - I am un@@ wa@@ xed about it , &quot; she said .
and when she was asked to choose whom Wood should choose , if not she , then she was en@@ ig@@ matic .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say , &quot; she said .
I love the left girls alike - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor &apos;s degree is broad@@ cast@@ ed on ten , 7 : 30 pm .

Jar@@ ry@@ i Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL @-@ career .
Detroit and Seattle have great interest after moving to the USA - and there were many other teams that sent questions after its impressive open day of training at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ on chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and coach Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a wise decision .
some co@@ aches have banned Hay@@ on for the rest of the game when he lost a don@@ ko@@ j so he did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Rug@@ by league console with his first pun@@ t return on Tuesday at the 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minnesota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ on the next opportunity to give a pun@@ t return and also into the running game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula still showed his true face in the changing room to the game .
instead of ro@@ ok@@ ies to gr@@ ind your ro@@ ok@@ ies , he encouraged her .
Tom@@ s@@ ula strength@@ ens Hay@@ on publicly in his press conference after the play .
the 49@@ ers Sport@@ rep@@ orter Cam In@@ man told that Hay@@ on was also encouraged by special teams coordin@@ ator Thomas Mc@@ G@@ aug@@ he@@ y who advised him to take care of his pat@@ ched catch and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ i Hay@@ ne is pat@@ ched by a Pun@@ t who was restored in the first quarter of the Minnesota Dis@@ ks
it was certainly not the way the Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian dealer had hop@@ ed for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ on left the playing field after the F@@ um@@ ble , and later told the Australian Radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he could not imagine a bad start to his N@@ FL career ,
&quot; that was a thing that comes from now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; Hay@@ on said .
Hay@@ on compared the se@@ ater with his Origin was in 2007 when a pass was in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area to a T@@ ry for Queens@@ land .
overall it was a great experience for the 27 year old .

at the start of the FW @-@ autumn @-@ sur @-@ Wu@@ erz@@ burg group , in front of a severe crisis in Bay@@ erns schools , when there is no new teacher for the many new students , &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to preserve the schools before the collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger .

the public elec@@ torate of the Free voters pers@@ ist in the municipality of Fran@@ con@@ ian Commun@@ e until Friday .

&quot; of course , the issue will asylum from clau@@ se , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
Ai@@ wan@@ ger challenged the deployment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , just as they were during the UN @-@ war in the n@@ ine@@ ties .
&quot; it &apos;s not going on , we have to go to the causes , &quot; said the Free voters .
rejected asylum seek@@ ers want to push free voters as soon as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore Ai@@ wan@@ ger also demanded more personnel for the administrative household of asylum applications : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seek@@ ers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the FW body critic@@ ised that several German states were not resol@@ utely ready : &quot; we need nationwide standard of the Bundes@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; Bavaria comes down , others do not . &quot;

Mr D@@ ha@@ k@@ al said that police used Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as , then fired in the air before moving back on rubber floors .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not clear why the rubber patches used , of which it is known that they can actually kill , but traditionally used as a less fatal alternative , such a high death rate seems to be produced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conflict was the last in weeks violent protest in Nep@@ als southern levels , where members of the ethnic group of Mad@@ r@@ hes@@ i say that new provinces that would be formed within the proposed new constitution which would reduce their political influence . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the planning for holiday houses on the Little Sea in Em@@ den take shape .
the Investor did for the first time publicly support the project .

Google starts distribut@@ ing donations campaign to collect 11 million $ for refugees
&quot; &quot; &quot; Google Inc . ( GO@@ O@@ GL . O ) announced a dou@@ bling grants campaign that will help thousands of refugees to help thousands of refugees , who have over@@ ruled the European nations as they flee from war torn and arm@@ ingly countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach in the announcement of donations call on his blog .
instead of leaving one manager the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google associate , who fled with her family from Kabul , had fled with her family from Kabul , when she was seven years old .
&quot; during our trip many dark railway and bus rides , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; she wrote .
I was lucky .
but since the refugee and migrants are growing in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ate for help .
donations go to four non @-@ profit organizations , supporting refugees and migrants at their disposal : doctors without fron@@ ti@@ ers , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and United Nations High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first globally collected donations will be dou@@ bling up to a value of 5.5 million to goo@@ gle@@ .com / san@@ er@@ el@@ ief to $ 11 million .
Europe is confron@@ ted with its worst refugee crisis since World War II , largely by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has sold more than 4 million people this year .

for easily excessive di@@ abe@@ tics , weight loss should be helpful .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes may take at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say whether easily over@@ weigh@@ ted people with diabetes after weight loss surgery is longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; death data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial on the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Surgery .
weight loss Surgery or O@@ bes@@ ity surgery , use various methods to shr@@ ink the size of mag@@ n@@ itude .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s own ability to nour@@ ish food .
over the years obesity has proved effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes as efficiently , but most studies were performed in people with a body mass index ( BMI ) of 35 or higher .
BMI , a certain degree of weight in terms of size , considered normal between 18@@ ,5 and 24,@@ 9 .
a BMI of 25 or more indicates that anyone is overweight and people with a BMI over 30 are considered obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BMI here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study used the researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data that have been collected in a study since 2007 and compare two kinds of obesity and gast@@ ric formation - for medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily over@@ weigh@@ ted .
the average BMI among those under@@ going surgery , decreased from 31 to 24@@ ,5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile the BMI stayed with those non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments received approximately equal to 29 .
among those who under@@ goes a surgical procedure , 36 % dis@@ b@@ anded the diabetes and at 28 % in part .
in the medical @-@ treated group , diabetes also dis@@ b@@ anded in only one percent and partly with only around two percent .
moreover , the outcomes in the control of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ ceri@@ de , and the &quot; bad &quot; LD@@ L cholesterol &quot; were generally better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , &quot; found the authors out .
the researchers also super@@ vised the patient blood levels of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels throughout the time .
hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c is best held at 7 percent , write the researchers .
after surgery , the average hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c decreased by around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
in the medical treatment group , however , it remained stable at around 8 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but these better &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gly@@ cem@@ ic control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - as opposed to the improved hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c level , did not dimin@@ ish mortality in five years , the guiding researcher Dr. chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the research team also includes average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost weight compared to the gas rec@@ tom@@ y group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , larger resi@@ dency in the BMI ( 7.4 vs. 5.1 ) and hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and recorded rather a complete over@@ coming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show survival benefit from surgery to five years , there are evidence from a study of serious human beings in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , tells Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study it was among obes@@ e people who under@@ gone obesity , about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried un@@ conventional methods .
although the new study showed no benefit for survival in surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it is so@@ othing for people with a BMI less than 35 that are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BMI group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should begin to take weight seriously if the patient is lying with his BMI between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we are waiting for too long until we take people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think once they have accumulated the genetic changes that have firmly associated with obesity and diabetes is really difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Europe could not take up all refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution of the refugee crisis in the Middle East . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist leader called on to stop violence in the refugees of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of a lasting refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion in Oxford which is devoted to eth@@ ics studies .
he demanded that under the circumstances the interests of humanity should be put to the interests of individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the reaction of the West European countries ad@@ mira@@ ble to the refugee crisis , but the situation is not adequate .
&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech .
although Germany &apos;s Dalai Lama and Austria &apos;s efforts to combat the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as real peace and real development , mainly through education , for those Muslim countries &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the end , we must think about how the killing is reduced in their countries .
we must reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the use of violence has never solved this problem , &quot; he added .
the Dalai Lama promised the issue of violence and commented on George Bus@@ y &apos;s action following the terrorist attack on September 11 and issued a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events after the United States .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush and I told him the way to resolve this issue lies in non@@ violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he put authority over , and that caused unexpected consequences &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a qu@@ ad increase of disinf@@ ection by children in the past 4 years
tox@@ in action centres in the U.S. report on nearly 400 percent increase in the number of children under twelve years of age , which do not swal@@ low alcoholic hand disinf@@ ect@@ ants , such as the Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenue from disinf@@ ect drugs come under 12 years , the po@@ ison@@ ous centres report , from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; children are becoming more and more common in these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go in the emergency &quot; said Lop@@ ez CNN .
he said that some children were able to drink disinf@@ ect@@ ant while some are doing to im@@ press their friends or because of a mut@@ ing in the social media .
show videos on YouTube as te@@ ens disinf@@ ect@@ ant only because of a cheap experience .
you@@ ths have supp@@ os@@ edly mixed disinf@@ ect@@ ant with soft oral bad water to get a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive vents of disinf@@ ect@@ ant .
&quot; one child does not think this is bad for it , &quot; said Lop@@ ez .
many of the most attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant ) are those that are perf@@ umed .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ant with straw@@ berry , wine @-@ grapes and orange juice , which are very appe@@ aling for children .
disinf@@ ect@@ ant contain between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially in infants can a few spra@@ yers can lead to alcohol pois@@ oning .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the tox@@ ics call centre at the University of Kansas , the Fox 4 station in K@@ ansa City .
so , you would not leave a si@@ p whis@@ key , but people leave this hand disinf@@ ect@@ ant in reach of children , and if children come about it , then it is a quick way to consume much alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who had recently taken four spra@@ ying of straw@@ berry disinf@@ ection products at school , was brought to treatment in a emergency room .
her blood alcohol level was 179 , twice higher than the threshold that is served in law for an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , a emergency doctor who treated her at the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
but N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ acks their words and was unable to go away when she came in the emergency .
doctors gave them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital to sign the signs of brain trau@@ ma , as the girl was fallen through the alcohol and had pushed the head , she said Rit@@ ch@@ ey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was very sc@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ toria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ wan@@ s mother , CNN . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been deadly for my child .
Lop@@ ez has parents and teachers of recommended , non @-@ alcoholic products or disinf@@ ect@@ ations to make use of disinf@@ ection outside the reach of the child .
about alcohol pois@@ oning were some disinf@@ ect@@ ant associated with deaths .
in 2013 two women in Ontario were killed after the swal@@ lowing of disinf@@ ect@@ ants , which contained a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient .
employees of health authorities have mut@@ ed that the product meth@@ anol contained a le@@ thal solution instead of eth@@ yl alcohol , which was noted as an active ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in January , three students of the fourth class were planning to poison their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; master &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; teacher of pois@@ oning her &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; teacher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by putting anti@@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he reports a police report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic against disinf@@ ect hands and associated them from their space .
the police in@@ treated the ver@@ ted plan as &quot; Some@@ how &quot; and referred to the school authorities .

the lack of title competition in Scottish football bored in Dutch - de Bo@@ er
former Rang@@ ers @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ronald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have interest to Celtic people , there is no titles with the Rang@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Ajax , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Holland , they show no highlights of the Celtic games more and why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s because the Rang@@ ers are not there .
people here are not just talking about the trip &apos;s return .
they speak about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams , and that is what they are interested in .
there is a lot of excitement in the Old Fir@@ m games , and there are not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn around the things , swe@@ ars off De@@ ila .
R@@ onny De@@ ila has accepted that she must fight , but the Norwegian chef s@@ wore to turn things around .
after the defeat against Malmö and the subsequent ex@@ ult@@ ation of the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ man of Aber@@ deen , which now stands with five points , clearly become the top of the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but De@@ ila said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Celtic had bad times before , and we will come back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
I know , it is very fru@@ str@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel exactly that - but we must go on .
we really need Celtic support , because that makes the player better .
standing together is so important .

the Scottish unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was 5.5 per cent above the UK@@ s &apos;s figures , as the figures for National Statistics ( ON@@ S ) demonstrated .

why I am being a di@@ stra@@ ction in Oklahoma
somewhat later , except in late legal intervention , I will look like a man is put to death .
when it happens , and I hope that it will not happen , I will sit in an audience gallery in the Oklahoma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary in Oklahoma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is executed by le@@ thal injection .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
the invitation was written for the first time in January on his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
when the day drew closer , I began to fear .
so , why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the USA , and there are often more applications available as places available , there is a perfect lot@@ tery to decide who will be elected .
Oklahoma has been occupied by the number of media slots from 12 to five .
who is selected , he will be watching more emotional .
I can &apos;t do that .
I &apos;m going to sit with Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps eng@@ aging friend with whom I developed my own relationship over the months with calls and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
often we laugh a lot when we speak .
the Pr@@ ison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to record a notebook and a pen to record what I see .
I simply have to try to remind me of all the details .
a journalist from Oklahoma , calling me on Twitter to give up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner , how he wants it , and you will receive access .
I compl@@ ained with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they cleared it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it could have been better form@@ ulate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but she still thinks it is wrong which I do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard Glos@@ s@@ p had a problem with some of the things I said and written .
he tells me not what to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wishes that an international rep@@ orter is present to write there .
if he dies , he thinks that public@@ ity would help the movement against the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ad@@ ware , a rep@@ orter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , is sitting next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please hear the record pod@@ casts that I have made .
I will not go down here again to all details .
I can not say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his deeds after the assassination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would not blame him of being a benef@@ ici@@ aries of deed .
but I believe that a strong lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood is that he is not guilty of murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe that there is no evidence to justify evidence of death . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I believe his execution is false .
and I will see him from this perspective .
I can not claim to be real objective .
there will be other rep@@ orters in which you can turn to it .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man die unnecessary death .

Peter Moo@@ dy said that ste@@ wards tried to cut him out and threatened to stop racing
Peter Moo@@ dy said that ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in its st@@ ables last year and threatened to stop the race immediately .
he aimed at the ste@@ wards and the integration department of Racing Victoria and claimed they had a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai because of a racing day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media that he always tried to do that which is best for racing and he himself found himself under difficult conditions when it was about the positive cob@@ alt @-@ up sample at Li@@ dar@@ is he could not explain .

they know that it far@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes one respon@@ ds , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with it what I said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I want to walk in the head , and I want my owners to think that I am going to do my best for them .
when you start to think , I don &apos;t do it , then I should not be a coach .

Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of Route L , David Moo@@ dy , former president of Route L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , former CEO of Route L , were now aware of the time and are still today .
should this make me think that it will be personally ?
has the RU@@ L be@@ aked and do people outside of train@@ ers responsible for what &apos;s going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think there is that I am .
perhaps they have to take my license and remove me , and I have no doubt that what I say is now thinking about it now .
but I &apos;m just arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad .
this really makes me sad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and push them to make a decision . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the train@@ ee levels of the train@@ ers have built up with the long @-@ going cob@@ alt direction at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching carried out that he could &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; disc@@ ard his license above the table &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Moo@@ dy , best known for its preparation by the un@@ iting master of Black C@@ avi@@ ar , marked the race rate treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; after a pack had been applied to mud , or clay , which pushed back against the rules .
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; one of my co @-@ workers has put the mud to the leg .
it could have been like yesterday evening .
it would have been like yesterday the whole day , which was so .
but it had also been so on the race day .
Moo@@ dy could be confron@@ ted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the package on race day . an investigation on this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who establish these rules , know nothing about the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you go too far , &quot; Moo@@ dy said .
man after Bal@@ ar@@ ses Pre@@ par@@ ing

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Bell@@ amy strikes back against ri@@ vals for ring battle against ri@@ vals
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Bell@@ amy has critic@@ ised the Tac@@ tical of his players as &quot; Agenda @-@ Set@@ ting &quot; of two Premier League favour@@ ites of N@@ R@@ L .
Sydney Roo@@ ster coach Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the arbit@@ rator from the Storm players &quot; Ring battles &quot; with his team have allowed the qualifying finals in Sydney on Friday night .
Brisbane Bron@@ cos Trainer Wayne Bennett has made a hardly ve@@ iled note to the Storm team after his crew had reached the Final victory against North Queens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday evening . he called the game a &quot; exempl@@ ar &quot; of the ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Queens@@ land won &apos;t be &quot; good &quot; in rings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy defended the T@@ ack@@ a mg of his team and said that she was only &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; focused on her &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tac@@ kling the tac@@ kling of tac@@ kling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bell@@ amy added that the cr@@ iti@@ que of two leading coach on his team agree to him , as it means they were worried about to be defeated by the Storm team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this always emerges again - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson talked about ring battles when she fought for 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that we have changed nothing in our def@@ ensive system or techniques throughout the year . but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with tac@@ kl@@ es a real focus , and that has provided for us the turn@@ st@@ ice .
Tr@@ ent is now there for three years , and he obviously did a great team . he &apos;s probably not used to lose it , so it was a bit of a shock for him .
it is funny , as it always comes back to this season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy attacked the idea of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exciting football &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and re@@ minded that Benn@@ &apos;s St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons called the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; te@@ di@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wayne talks about exciting football .
he compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting her game was , &quot; Bell@@ amy said .
I remember that St George was critic@@ ised as a boring team in 2010 and Wayne told he had to care for a divor@@ ce .
but now he has a team that can play and that we watch as exciting , especially its young players with their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play if you have this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play like these .
I re@@ build confidence because they say these things , because they are a bit worried about playing with us .
six weeks ago , they probably did not think of us than it was about the big Games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the Storm against Roo@@ ster was higher than the game Bron@@ cos against cow@@ boys .
the game of the borough was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two further attempts in our game , but is this an exciting game ?
or are breaks and do not point a bit of tension ?
it &apos;s the plans for me .
when they mention to us , it means that we will meet in a phase .
the Storm Team has won this weekend free as they have the right to receive either North Queens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks on the next Saturday night at the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales start next Tuesday morning .
bier with 200.000 $ damage to drug addic@@ tions
a man who is possibly threat@@ ening a life punishment because of his attempt to come in possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , who were s@@ mu@@ g@@ gled to Queens@@ land , b@@ ail a damage deposit of $ 200,000 .
Marko Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested during the last month after the police found 100 kg of drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America via V@@ anu@@ at@@ u and in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed how he met his co @-@ def@@ endants in the marina and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
despite a possibly vital penalty for the attempt to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , argu@@ ed the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , there was no evidence that he tried to possess the overall amount and that in the Café could have been a harmless reason .
the judge of the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan , was worried about the danger of escape by Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained the court on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the trial , he lied to the police on his residence .
Mak@@ si@@ mov@@ ics &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of 200,000 dollars as safety , in order to reach his release .
&quot; after reading the hand@@ held explanations of the two people , it is clear that the circulation of 200,000 dollars represents a real financial burden , &quot; said Richter Flan@@ agan .
but this alone shall not be sufficient to prevent him from being able to appear , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was released on b@@ ail , under the conditions that he ab@@ uses his Australian and Serbian Pass to join the police daily with a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
accident on A5 at Karlsruhe : wheel@@ house runs apart .
with a rear @-@ up with three trucks on the motorway 5 at Karlsruhe a truck driver had been severely injured on Tuesday night .
two of the three cars involved had bra@@ ked them down in the direction of Basel .
the third driver re@@ marked it too late , trying in vain to devi@@ ate at the last moment to the left as the police informed .
the driver &apos;s house of the accident caused completely apart .
the driver was severely injured in a hospital .
the A5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely locked over six hours until 2@@ am .
there was a damage amounting to 12@@ 2.000 Euro .
Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used phone of girls to attract ped@@ op@@ hil@@ es to sending images
a ped@@ agogue used the phone of a 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl to demand pictures of child abuse .
Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the phone of the girl as this slept ; log into an online mess@@ aging service , by which he received a series of un@@ decent images of children who were sent from another user .
the girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping h@@ og@@ g .
she looked through her , she found her mother conf@@ using , and immediately embra@@ ced her mother .
the police looked after that , and saw the five images , analysed then computers that were found under the address , and discovered &quot; Web @-@ research &quot; which was used for searching for inde@@ cent images of children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ og@@ g then claimed to the officials that he would have done it , as there was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ped@@ oph@@ ile on the Internet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then he called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a polic@@ eman , to fri@@ gh@@ ten them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the At@@ tor@@ ney E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on told the Dun@@ de@@ e Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be a diction that he is addic@@ ted to fri@@ gh@@ ten people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he gave me that the search had been carried out on the computer by him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it would happen , because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to fri@@ gh@@ ten ped@@ oph@@ ile . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was asked for his convers@@ ations with an unknown person who sent him the pictures and he asked him to send even more photos .
he said he did so to l@@ ure them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said he was sick of the head , when he drinks , and said he will see images of rape and murder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and she was at the trem@@ bling and the crying . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she also saw the in@@ decent images on the telephone and con@@ front the accused .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and told that the accused computers and Play@@ station used to talk to girls who were much younger than he looked .
H@@ og@@ g , 23 , Ward Road , Dun@@ de@@ e , pleaded not guilty to the crimes of the indictment , in@@ consistent pictures of children on 14 June this year and had not appeared before the Court to be appearing on 24 March this year .
def@@ enses advoc@@ ates Gregor S@@ im said that H@@ og@@ g is not appearing in the Sexual perpet@@ rators , as you can argue that &quot; there is no considerable sexual element in his hiding place .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff A@@ list@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael swallowed up the judgement of October to obtain background reports about social work .
H@@ og@@ g was granted in this case but was held in temporary detention for hear@@ ings to other cases .
he was still taken before the date of judgment in the directory of sexual off@@ ences .
locks on small border cross@@ ings to Germany from
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more and more refugees are taken off from the large con@@ tro@@ ll@@ ing points on the German @-@ Austrian border . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many locks made from fear of discovery and capture people are increasing in smaller border cross@@ ings
on the Austrian side , a national police spokes@@ man said .
along the land@@ flow Inn , more than 1,000 refugees were taken up in the districts of Pass@@ au and R@@ ott@@ al @-@ Inn .
they were walking over bridges and traffic lights to the German side .
there they are received by the federal police and for@@ warded to the registration .
according to the Federal Police Department at Munich , more than more refugees arrived in the Munich Central Station on Wednesday .
about 700 people in the country &apos;s capital alone are at home alone until 8.00 pm , said a spokes@@ man for the morning .
after the re@@ introduction of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border , the city reached the city on Tuesday in 17@@ 59 .
Stuttgart : runner of tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; in the southwest
meteor@@ ologist war@@ n against ra@@ mb@@ als in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon .
due to a deep pres@@ sur@@ ization about Western Europe , hot sea air flows into the country , the German weather Service ( D@@ WD ) divided into Stuttgart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the strong depth is the prec@@ ursor of the tropical storm &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which was drawn to the Atlantic in recent days from the Bermuda Islands over the Atlantic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
strong storms and storms are expected especially in Baden .
according to D@@ WD , up to th@@ urs@@ days also in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the soil conditions with the gu@@ sts of 60 to 90 km / hour .
on Friday we can look back the sun much longer .
the mass makes it : all two years the car show@@ rooms show their novel@@ ties at the IAA .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 2015 is particularly well @-@ selling movement in the compact cars that currently sell particularly well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at present , cars from the compact class are currently being asked : around 2@@ 8.1 % of new appro@@ vals have been accounted for by the Federal Rail@@ roads ( KBA ) alone in August on this segment .
this is also reflected at the IAA ( Audi@@ ence stage 17 - 27 September ) .
in this year , a lot of new compact models will be presented between all of the futur@@ istic concept cars and luxury cars .
one of the greatest premier@@ es for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will be available from dealers in the autumn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
as a result , the volume model is also well sold , the new Astra should not be much more expensive .
Opel introduces a entry level below the largest competition VW Golf in Views , which starts at 17 650 euros .
the current Astra is priced at Euro 16 990 .
the Astra boasts a new 1.4 liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , the H@@ esse offer further diesel and gasoline engines from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp to which for the first time also three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines count .
unlike the most important compet@@ itor VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is available only as a five @-@ door .
the second variant will follow in the spring of Com@@ bi , which is already shown at the IAA .
and what will be next to the Opel Astra at the IAA ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault is the fourth generation of its Astra @-@ competition in the race .
the Mé@@ tro is also available for five times in a conventional and a st@@ acc@@ entu@@ ated sporty GT version at the trade fair .
in trade at the beginning of the year , he is also a com@@ bi .
Infin@@ iti : brand new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan @-@ de@@ strian aims to find its position in the strong growing segment with the new model .
the compact Infin@@ iti with its curved lines is fully integrated into the brand &apos;s design line .
the basic model will receive a gasoline engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
this is also a diesel engine with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Suzuki Bal@@ eno : the Suzuki Bal@@ eno , which is its world premiere in Frankfurt , is also Suzuki Bal@@ eno .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 HP .
the maximum torque is up to 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .
the bal@@ eno sales launch in Europe is launched in spring 2016 .
DS 4 : not completely new , but completely new is the compact K@@ DS 4 compact model that can be seen at the IAA .
outside the designer of the noble Citro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ ers laid hands above all hands at the front end : here the radiator grill was re@@ drawn and fitted with LED technology .
in the interior , above all , the inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system was moderni@@ zed , the number of buttons is reduced by a touch screen , using Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play .
in addition , the IAA in the compact class met a number of overclo@@ ckers and new variants , such as the emerging Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 308 GT@@ I .
J@@ VA Berlin Te@@ gel : five square metres of prison are decent
the Federal Constitutional Court has quite ordered a ex @-@ conscience of the Te@@ gel Legal Office , which was incar@@ cer@@ ated for months in a small cell .
because of the violation of human dignity , they generally claims financial compensation , when they are accommod@@ ated in too small cells .
that has decided the Bundes@@ verfassungs@@ gericht stated in a decision published on Wednesday .
according to those people , they can even hope for money , if only few days in the confin@@ ed spaces were locked ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
this was an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe . he was housed in a single cell with some five square metres floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was therefore not separate .
afterwards , the man who is now on foot according to his lawyer was laid back on foot in a larger cell .
its terms of coverage due to the un@@ worthy arrest of arrest against the State of Berlin has failed .
however , the Constitutional Judge took up the verdict of the Berlin Chamber of Sciences and transferred the case to re @-@ trial .
they see the man &apos;s dignity hurt .
Kammer@@ Amts@@ gericht now decides about the amount of compensation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although for legal reasons only a few days of detention for the compensation were decisive for compensation , it was given an ob@@ jection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
otherwise , &quot; a criminal responsibility would be to be feared . &quot;
the chamber must now clari@@ fy the amount of money .
the judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past .
so in April they spoke to a prisoner , because he was imprisoned in a cell .
deser@@ un@@ worthy , a single decision from 2011 is according to a single cell without separate toilet .
in addition , in addition to the Berlin International Court of Appeals in November 2009 , Karlsruhe confirmed a decent accommodation for a decent accommodation in November 2009 .
the then @-@ time put@@ ty was across three months daily between 15 and 21 hours in a very same cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
the Berlin pris@@ ons have also made head@@ lines in the head@@ lines in recent weeks .
prisoners are therefore included 23 hours , the aggres@@ si@@ veness increases , even to hits , it should have already come to slaughter .
according to information of the judicial authorities , 21 sites in Te@@ gel do not have been occupied due to young lack , 19 are expected to fall in 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we create the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the immigration of refugees is a tremendous challenge - the Federal Chancellor decided to accept them .
what comes to Germany ?
about 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany according to forecasts of the Federal Ministry of Austria this year , following statement by Vice Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is able to absorb a million refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) demonstrated us again in view of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again : we can do this , and we can do this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what comes to Germany medi@@ ates the following overview .
used are used according to different forecasts between 3@@ 500@@ 00 ( estim@@ ation of the federal ministry ) and 400@@ 000 ( valu@@ ation of the Pest@@ el Institute ) year @-@ yearly , namely the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it is built ( 25@@ 0000 apartments ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lack of living space is especially at paid rent : yearly 600@@ 00 up to 800@@ 00 welfare payments from the rental price are incur@@ red and in order to apply these particularly convenient apartments will also apply refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) also aims to double the promotion of 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
much too little is that from the point of view of the Pest@@ el Institute : 80 000 social elections per year would have to arise and therefore the association would have to invest a funding of 6.4 billion a year .
schol@@ ars and federal government are united that there are also more tax benefits for investment in residential construction .
according to estim@@ ations of the Institute for Employment Research , 55 percent of the poultry in Germany can be acquired in long @-@ term .
however , the refugees in Germany would not have asked system@@ atically about their qualification to assist them when getting started , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
but decisive for the integration of refugees is crucial , whether they work in Germany .
work is the key for social contacts , for este@@ em in the reception society , but also for the self @-@ este@@ em of the immigrants , says Mig@@ ration@@ alist Dietrich Thr@@ mann .
according to the thr@@ ill a political transition in Germany has given a political turning point : from the ban on refugees to be recognised by labour .
while there was a ban on asylum seek@@ ers for asylum seek@@ ers from up to five years ago , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the resi@@ den@@ ers , the asylum seek@@ ers are limited to a residence .
in society , - also because of the technical equi@@ po@@ si@@ veness - it is evi@@ den@@ sely asser@@ ted that refugees should be facil@@ itated even quicker access to the labour market .
there is no major hur@@ dle for access to the labour market .
there is no sufficient offer in general and occup@@ ational courses .
studies also show that jobs are most frequently convey@@ ed by personal contacts .
the building of networks is therefore a royal road view of the throne of labor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Berlin School has established that only few refugees fle@@ dged their children to the day@@ cares , estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the saus@@ age parents , it is very important to meet the family , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ diag@@ bar , spokes@@ man for youth and family at Berlin &apos;s Senate department . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to convince the family of the benefits of the K@@ ita , the managing boards spread in different languages .
if the demand for educ@@ ators is increasing by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase training capacities , giving more expertise .
in the countries students will be prepared without German staff .
but they are not always taught of trained teachers and teachers , but as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language .
there is no lack of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ ells from the Berlin School of School .
the German student project estimates that about 20 per cent of the refugees in Germany want to study .
not legally , no federal land asylum seek@@ ers or ab@@ h@@ ed the study - the only exception to so far Berlin , internal sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CDU ) has now given up its position .
research permits could be facil@@ itated by access to the university .
because refugees with a resident , or dung , do not receive any efforts following asylum seek@@ ers if they start studying .
the latter are generally not a BA@@ fö@@ G since it does not fall under the number of persons eligible .
Ged@@ ser Refu@@ ge@@ es had to have lived for four years so far in Germany to be eligible for BA@@ fö@@ G from January 1 , 2016 , this sp@@ ine has been shortened to 15 months .
it also has to be closed , Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German student union .
the students should instantly get BA@@ fö@@ G .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Islam will play a more important role in the future , because many refugees are Muslims , and the religion is an important part of their identity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the state should succ@@ essi@@ vely replace the same rights as they have the churches , and the existing State churches right to develop a new state @-@ religion ratio .
the establishment of an Islamic welfare association would also be important , which professionally takes care of the new arri@@ vals .
rights belong to the right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so the representatives of Islam must agree with clear contact to some and ready to work with the state in many areas and to give him certain control options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this also includes read@@ iness , controls on religious fundament@@ alism .
the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed fears , religious conflicts could also be brought to Germany as well .
those who want to experience such conflicts in Germany have immediately their right to stay here in Germany , &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk .
he proposed to translate the Basic Law of Arab .
integration will be in future much more than a matter of society today .
thus , the majority society has to change , Dis@@ mant@@ ling of Dis@@ cri@@ mination and Rac@@ ism .
Germany has - as a result of European decisions - a crime of discrimination and a sec@@ rec@@ y gender equality law since a decade .
but it lear@@ ns very slowly , as the NSU @-@ M@@ ord@@ serie showed , , in the police and authorities , system@@ atically ignored the rac@@ ist motive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chances for all : what Mig@@ rant organizations and the st@@ ak@@ eholders &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have long been demanding for a long time and why international agreements must become peaceful in the next few years , if the country will remain peace@@ fully and its new citizens must use their opportunities - for the benefit of everyone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
generally Germany is capable of providing healthcare to so far , medical president Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery , said :
&quot; what man@@ - power and capacities concern , we create it , &quot; he said the Tages@@ spiegel .
however , additional money required to flow in the system .
to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery calls for all of its suppliers in the registration of health types .
these services could later be reck@@ oned with the federal states .
and in the long term , it is highly question@@ able to search for so many people with the limited performance catalogue to see the asylum seek@@ ers Act .
otherwise , physi@@ cians do not make the language barriers .
as far as the Berlin healthcare scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has demonstrated , migrants are worse than other patients .
not only in clinics , also in medical records , interpre@@ ting costs would need to be taken over .
but helped many refugees , however , even with more general medical centers in the emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic view .
in refugee children there are clearly more untreated disability , and with the young people I go about HIV clari@@ fication .
Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery writes about the partial other clinical pictures , but Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery comments .
&quot; paras@@ ite membran@@ es or tuber@@ culosis are not as difficult to detect . &quot; and as for the h@@ iss@@ ing angel , even relief in sight is caused by the refugees .
the Syrians would have developed a high @-@ developed educational system , some refugees even doctors .
in order to be pract@@ ised , however , they would have to re@@ prove their qualification and dis@@ counted them again .
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany is psych@@ ically ill after app@@ rais@@ al : most suffering from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or under depression .
he is particularly vulner@@ able to refugee children , Dietrich Mun@@ z explains President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K .
a recently published study of the TU München shows that every fifth Syrian refugee movement arrives in Germany .
whoever is suffering from a post trau@@ matic stress disorder is suffering from the so @-@ called flash backs with respir@@ atory , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart@@ beat and death toll .
other symptoms include sleep and concentration problems , strong depression and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
in order to prevent the symptoms of chronic symptoms of chronic treatment , Mun@@ z stated .
yet so far only four percent of the psych@@ ologically ill refugees have received an psych@@ otherapy .
while psychological sick asylum seek@@ ers can place an application for a psych@@ otherapy , nevertheless the processing lasts several months .
in addition , in the social sector experts , experts or doctors , who are not trained for the psychological conditions , would decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this often lead to mal@@ estim@@ ations , says Mun@@ z .

the goal is to draw any age group in the spell of intri@@ gu@@ ing ac@@ rob@@ atics , veter@@ inary bladder and unique entertainment .
now the Circus Pro@@ bst invites you to the man@@ ege on the tiles of O@@ was@@ ps to dream .
&quot; our passion is cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine to live without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Stephanie Pro@@ bst , veter@@ an teacher and Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - under this slogan says the current man@@ sions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the family since more than 33 years .
so the gift to love is in the blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to take the people away from their everyday law and take it to a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphas@@ ises the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; man@@ made cocktail with world town of Fl@@ air , &quot; Reinhard Pro@@ bst calls his concept .
this fl@@ air can now experience 50 cities on the almost 3 000 kilometers long tour .
the Circus convinces by talented artists from all over the world .
excell@@ ently at the international cir@@ cus festival of Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family sees the audience with w@@ it and charm in their spell .
the Castillo Brothers are also learning their hand@@ craft .
with the heroes of the silent film , the Cuban duo will loose .
light@@ ness and mot@@ ility - in these words they identify themselves .
her hum@@ orous art at the mast should conquer women &apos;s hearts .
except through numerous salmon groves , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Circus pro@@ bst cap@@ tiv@@ ates with finger@@ tips and artic@@ ulating .
balance the unic@@ ycle on a ball ?
there is no problem for He Yuan .
sn@@ ake people fascin@@ ate and fri@@ gh@@ ten them together .
Wang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics as little other and intri@@ gu@@ ed with its flexibility .
60 employees from twelve countries offer diversity in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; emphas@@ ises Stephen &apos;s mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
these mis@@ ses in the attitude of zir@@ cons are only very often subject to different animal rights organisations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Stephanie Pro@@ bst also takes his position : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not make our animals good , we do not go well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
each match is about 80 animals in five different continents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged news &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as she is lov@@ ingly called lov@@ ingly , will be read from the eyes whenever possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel well , it does not want to go into the recei@@ pts .
so the first commandment is : good for animals .
especially on her Zeb@@ ro@@ id Jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land Pon@@ y@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a zeb@@ ra@@ st@@ mare , the family is very proud .
the two animals lived in an enclosure for eight years and nothing happened .
&quot; but then , suddenly , our little jum@@ bo there , &quot; Brigitte Pro@@ bst re@@ writes .
the zeb@@ ro@@ id is not yet ready for the Man@@ ege but it is the unique mas@@ cot of Circus Pro@@ bst .
there should be something for each visitor .
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; says Stephanie Pro@@ bst , &quot; doesn &apos;t matter if five or 1 200 crowd , we always give our best and are with all my heart . &quot;
the Circus Pro@@ bst invites you to his ideas from 17 to 20 September daily .
on Sundays the program begins at 11 : 16 o &apos;clock .
Thursday is a family day , while at 17 o &apos;clock the prices are reduced .
in addition , the pet show is open from 10 am to 18 o &apos;clock .
Sim@@ bab@@ we@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe keeps false speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , fell down the stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case spread quickly through Social Media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Parliament &apos;s opening was also clou@@ ded by the statement of members of the opposition that they had defended anonymous deaths and warned them against Mr Mu@@ gabe by Mr Mu@@ gabe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
during the last month they had repaired and interrupted him during his speech to the State of the Nation - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man of movement for democratic change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) Inno@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven Opp@@ os@@ itions politicians have received SMS messages to their mobile phones , which they were war@@ med to b@@ other Mr. Mu@@ gab@@ les speech .
&quot; the message comes from a number which is not displayed , but it has the title &apos; death , &quot; he said journalists to the job of Mu@@ gab@@ us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she warns the members of the Parliament that the imm@@ unity ends in the parliament and as soon as they leave the Parliament , its parliamentary imm@@ unity is not effective anymore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief speaker said that Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worried &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the dangers for politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hewlett @-@ Packard gets up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett @-@ Packard is expected to build 25,000 to 30.000 jobs in the framework of restructuring and saving efforts at the company &apos;s services .
later this year , HP will split up into two publicly traded companies and separate the computer and printer business from its rapidly growing company &apos;s hardware and service activities .
the expected job reduction leads to a strain of more than $ 2.7 billion from the fourth quarter , HP said in one explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this restructuring measures will enable a competitive , sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett @-@ Packard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP president and Chief Executive , who will lead the unit after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Hewlett Packard Enterprise is less and more focused than it today is HP today , and we have a wide and pro@@ found@@ ly portfolio of businesses that support firms in transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man .
as a stand@@ alone company , we are better positioned than ever to satisfy the changing needs of our customers all over the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than 50 billion annual sales and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is focused on providing so far un@@ att@@ ain@@ able , integrated technology solutions for companies &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; such a declaration of the company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 19@@ 30s by graduates of the Stan@@ ford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard , which has been called &quot; the birth@@ place of Silicon Valley &quot; and Palo Alto &apos;s home .
HP has a massive restructuring running to cope with the depart@@ ing of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
the move from HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this field , based on belief that narrow focus companies provide better performance .
FC Arsenal @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta said that team @-@ mates will have to stand before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb , behind the stopped Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger stressed against Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it is until September and so if his rehabilitation starts according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play again before Christmas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this optimistic scenario is already meant that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will surely be sure to miss at least the next four games for England and its participation in the next summer will certainly remain uncertain at the European Championship . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the big shame on this current problem is that wil@@ low had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then back to his old swing during the season .
&quot; this kind of injury is not threatened by the career , &quot; Wen@@ ger said .
it is a bone , which does not heal .
it is no major matter .
this was just an accident .
it was not in conjunction with his an@@ kl@@ es or the injuries that he had before .
this may be true of purely medical terms , but as Wen@@ ger acknowledged , there is the corresponding risk of any other injuries , always when a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the examination of Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd has recorded 23 different ill@@ nesses of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played the last five seasons in just 65 of the Bolshe@@ vi@@ als of the last five seasons .
the wider image of arsen@@ al is that they were in six out of eight playing times since 2007 / 08 one of the two Premier League clubs that have had most vulner@@ able days .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a devil , but Arsenal has that an improvement in the vulner@@ ability ratio during the last season is going to last .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , when you come back from an injury , you have a vulner@@ able period of time in which you must strengthen your body and win battle force , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body down@@ s , I am confident that he will do it and he will perform a career out of the way he deserves .
Arsenal begins his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb to play against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur next Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger will find a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey did not travel to Croatia , meaning that Math@@ ieu Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta start to start .
Wen@@ ger can also begin with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and the players who need it , a small auction break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Arsenal &apos;s clear favour@@ ites are to pass through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir @-@ Stadium in Zagreb is one of the venue with the largest in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation effect in Europe .
dynam@@ o is unbe@@ aten after 41 games , after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign has been launched during the last season .
the stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , where it was measured on the Richter scale .
this year it was the 10th of Zagreb .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the opinion that Arsenal had pulled from the last season with the Champions League chapter against Monaco and will continue to lead from distant hope to lead the club to his first European ok@@ al triumph . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; Wen@@ ger said .
it has never worked with arsen@@ al .
we were very close in 2006 , but on the other hand I am long enough in store to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we &apos;re not dre@@ amer .
friendship : the com@@ edy @-@ show , which grants us serious lessons about men &apos;s friends
the lack of similar depic@@ tions in shows is obvious , especially in regard to the need for men to open up , now even worse than ever before , how suicide rates of young men prove on a 15 @-@ year high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men at the age of 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and it remains more common in males than women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , the Campa@@ ign Against the Mis@@ er@@ ator ( CA@@ LM - Campa@@ ign against a mis@@ erable Life ) announces the aim of asking the culture in question , the men prevents them from trying to seek help when they require them .
friendship is the heart of the struggle to master this challenge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a recent study with more than 2,000 high @-@ school students with de@@ pressed symptoms proved that when the suff@@ erer has a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; healthy attitude &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; its chances of recovery doubled . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends are hal@@ ved the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends , so that a friendship may work .
in the age of more than social media , communication with their focus on architectural style about substance is often more important than an important contact .
our digital life have the need to be strong , lively and successful , even if in reality the isolation is dominated .
this superf@@ icial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists ex@@ tr@@ ine values call ; money , image , social status , all at cost of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship that affects our spiritual health much deeper .
and as a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire said recently , money can really not buy .
the beauty of friends was that this focus was on the head .
every character has not been defined by his work , but by his personality , which shines through the interaction as a friend .
hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler pairs of frequent hu@@ gs , Mom@@ ents at the football club in some cozy arm@@ chairs and the longing for Ross to Rachel - all that came from the knowledge that men can relate to any case , even if they often hold back their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an employee of the phone call it declared to me : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my list@@ ener for people who feel de@@ pressed and vulner@@ able are really shown to me how even the smallest inter@@ actions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us often feel not able to talk to friends often .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old Rede@@ mp@@ ic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come along with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has a tremendous impact , as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness if you speak about problems openly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term management mechanisms .
it clearly shows clearly the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
so very much my objective status about the phone to help people in moments of despair , too , long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with the perfect setting to celebration of the day , why don &apos;t you take your friends for a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better if you &apos;ll see in Star@@ bu@@ cks anyone only , give him a smile and say hello .
you never know what difference could make your friendship .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - the total 236 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria meets to help PS@@ G to destroy Malmö
angel Di Maria celebrates Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his match against Malmö .
di Maria meets with his debut at the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to move past Malmö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held course , when Paris Saint @-@ Germain put his Champions League season with a very comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malmö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ st@@ adion on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League Deb@@ ü@@ ts as PS@@ G player , who took the French masters on the way , but thereafter , they passed on a number of occasions , before they finally increased their lead when Cav@@ ani scored a head ball in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Sch@@ acht@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k in group A Paris requires a strong start to the Swedish master , since they are not only asp@@ iring into the qualification for the K.@@ O@@ .-@@ Round , but an improvement on the way to the quarter @-@ fin@@ alen in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , there was no classic game of Laurent Blan@@ cs &apos;s team with Zlat@@ an Ibra@@ him@@ ov@@ ics deep@@ ened opportunities in front of the gate . he was later in play against his home @-@ home team and against the association with whom he started his illustr@@ ative career in 1999 .
&quot; it is not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to bring our opponents problems and rela@@ xes , even if there is certain things that we have to perfect in the season , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Blanc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is a good sign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I &apos;m sorry we didn &apos;t have one or two other goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ibra@@ him@@ ovic returned to his injury in one of three changes to the Paris @-@ team that could hold a 2 : 2 draw on their own place against Bordeaux in the first League , but he was kicked out by Di Maria in the fourth minute .
the Argent@@ in@@ ean wing stor@@ my was called the PS@@ G on the next stage in Europe as he was taken over to the next month in Manchester , when he ran into Marco Ver@@ r@@ att@@ is Pass behind Malmö &apos;s defense before he finished in Johan Wil@@ and in the long corner of the network .
but if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed .
Malmö , the Celtic in a play @-@ off proposed to reach this level , stepped up with nine nation@@ alities on the field and was a five @-@ man def@@ ensive and two deep in the middle area .
but apart from a shot by Nikola D@@ jur@@ dj@@ ic , the far to Kevin Tra@@ pp fit@@ ter appeared in the 3@@ 4th minute , they ble@@ w little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G himself gave himself up sometimes , with some mis@@ sil@@ es and bad inten@@ tions , not least of Ibra@@ him@@ ovic , who was defeated in the first half by not less than five attempts , after Cav@@ ani had used it after the restart .
but he proved a lot more skill if he put his players in the game , and it was a pass from Ibra@@ him@@ ovic , whom Di Maria was turned into a shot , which was offered by po@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute by the pole .
the second gate finally fell short after the hour @-@ mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . at the time at Uruguay the fifth year of the season , after Ibra@@ him@@ ovic had fired a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
this did all thought that Malmö can come back into the game , and just an excellent intervention by Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz was able to keep the final outcome low before the substitute player E@@ ze@@ qu@@ iel Lav@@ e@@ zzi achieved a gate ended at the end .
the coach of Malmö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , gave later that PS@@ G played a class on his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League play was last year .
since then we have only played in the Swedish League , which has not the same level .
the quali@@ fications do not apply . &quot;
hat off to Paris !
it was a great game of them !

X@@ avi : P@@ EP Gu@@ ardi@@ ola caused change to FC Bayern in 2008
world and European champion X@@ avi has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
the FC Bayern was obviously in front of the commitment of Spain &apos;s Super@@ star X@@ avi , who then played for FC Barcelona at that time .
eight times Spanish champion , three times winner Champions League winner , twice championship @-@ champion , two time Club Champion , two time Champion , one time world champion , the title list of X@@ avi is breathtaking .
in the summer , 35 @-@ year @-@ old left the FC Barcelona for 24 years and changed to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar .
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ avi announces that he was standing in front of Barcelona &apos;s departure before the end of 2008 .
&quot; you told me that Bar@@ ça would like to sell me . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Madrid won &apos;t get anything at that time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he tells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that &apos;s where the FC Bayern was registered .
X@@ avi : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Rum@@ bl@@ ig@@ ge wanted to have me . &quot;
in memory : Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over the FC Bayern in the summer of 2008 .
Gu@@ ardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ avi changed not
but the bill was not going .
and the decisive man now works for the German record master : P@@ EP Gu@@ ardi@@ ola .
&quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ avi explains why : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça has taken Gu@@ ardi@@ ola and I have played a great EM . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; P@@ EP said to me that I wouldn &apos;t change that he could not imagine the team without myself . &quot;
&quot; with this he got a d@@ ashing of myself . &quot;
who knows how the Bavarian season 2008 / 2009 would be run with X@@ avi .
X@@ avi stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter @-@ finals of the Champions League , against the whole distance on the lawn , switched the red ones ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and at the end of the Royal triumph .
Matt Dam@@ on plays diversity in the movie
Matt Dam@@ on con@@ front the af@@ ro@@ American filmm@@ akers Eff@@ ie Brown on a discussion about diversity and said , she was not needed behind the scenes .
during a result of the Sunday Night of H@@ BO@@ s Project Green@@ light , experienced actor Brown , when this was the need of alternative perspectives , emphas@@ ized it with regard to a black prot@@ agon@@ ists in the project &apos;s elected script .
&quot; if we talk about diversity , then use it at the lin@@ eup of the film and not at the lin@@ eup of the show , &quot; assured Dam@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; brown re@@ acted , with ins@@ ulting un@@ belief and called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ o ! Wow . okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the comments of the actor by The Mar@@ tian set themselves up . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown finished producing , Ben Aff@@ in@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to re@@ consider people to think about it - whoever will always be the director - as she will treat the figure of Harmony , &quot; Brown first said .
the only black person , and she is a sp@@ line that is beaten by its white p@@ im@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the producer of Dear White People were seated for the Fin@@ alist Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ acci@@ o for direct direc@@ ting rights to the film ; Dam@@ on replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dam@@ on said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end we could do something that we don &apos;t want . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the discussion was broadcast , the social media explo@@ ded earlier dis@@ approval on Dam@@ ons &apos;s comments .
Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni put his anger over the clip , by writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on &quot; talking about the only black person in space , so he can declare your variety - this is SO WE@@ ISS that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
the twe@@ et served more than 5,000 Ret@@ we@@ ets and 4.000 L@@ ikes since its publication .
Dam@@ ons &apos;s comments are at a time when the exact location of representation in the media is at the top of the social discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the teenage boys killed Michael Brown , killed by a white polic@@ eman , the movement &quot; Black Li@@ ves &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; achieved national action and urge leg@@ is@@ lat@@ ors and authorities to contribute to discrimin@@ atory practices of paint co@@ hes@@ ion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in February , the singer Prince made an impression on the movement during the implementation of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; album quietly matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( albums have still their meaning ) he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as books and black life , albums have still their importance .
more recently , the leaders of the Black Li@@ ves movement published a declaration which , in response to the question of Fox News personality , Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be considered as a group of hatred .
&quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; said the leaders .
recently , there was announced that Dam@@ on was present on a list of Enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le to visit the Pope , to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or already made the Pope , is un@@ clear .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean it is aston@@ ishing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than $ 10,000 or to live , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! over his bunch of money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so suddenly .. I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the final , although he first ended the course in general , not just any prize money .
the rules are then sent to the quick@@ est person in accordance with the rules .
&quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alists , it is the one that &apos;s fastest time , &quot; says We@@ ed .
how much money is a wonderful price and life changes , he receives the great grat@@ u@@ ity .
I don &apos;t think he talks about it .
he is just so lucky to have done what he has done .
he received crowds of prizes by fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , then I &apos;m glad that Isaac is . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Isaac would have felt like the same if they had switched the rolls .
America Ninja Warrior was pro@@ longed for an eighth season , and the filming will begin in the spring of 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ ak over to Minnesota T@@ wins
mint ! the second half of the season was not particularly fun for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
once they used one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers stand on the last place in the American League of Central .
the tig@@ ers reduced their role as spo@@ iler , but played this part on Tuesday perfectly against the Minnesota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the target field .
the T@@ wins resulted in a chance for the ascent within a h@@ emisph@@ ere of the Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League of Wild@@ card @-@ Platz .
for Detroit , even though only for an evening , it was a return of the three letters F @-@ word which was hard to gras@@ p over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; all victories have fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers &apos;s manager Brad P@@ mus .
tiger Pit@@ cher Alfredo Simon held his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two inside , then once in the sixth and then once again on the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) defeated 6 times in 1 / 3 inside and made three ranks .
it was only his third successful start in his final nine games .
&quot; I want to finish this year strongly , &quot; Simon said .
it is hard to throw in the Bull@@ pen of each game , and so I want to completely concentrate in the game .
the designated tiger Hit@@ ter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two ranks , his first R@@ B@@ Is since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three @-@ hit Game from Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits on the Seattle Church on July 6 .
&quot; he ra@@ cked the drums well , &quot; said Te@@ m .
he looked good at the ( kick training ) , clearly seen better from the Bull@@ pen , and he brought it directly into the game .
with three ranks in the back at the end of the seventh ar@@ ings the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back into play .
center F@@ iel@@ der Byron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double in the left field line .
right F@@ iel@@ der Aaron H@@ icks reached a colorful , and Simon carried his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zer to Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy hoo@@ ded driver .
Har@@ dy ran down the wall , the only man who was confron@@ ted with whom he was confron@@ ted by the designated Rook@@ ie drums Miguel S@@ ano , who will release a Two @-@ Run behind the righ@@ t@@ ist Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen .
with a pair of runners and the finishing Run in the second , Ver@@ hagen gave the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ cher to a double play .
it was this in the Major League leading 27th time in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe was playing a Double Play .
after arriving at the end of the ninth interior to an Insurance Run , wall took an R@@ BI @-@ double against the loose the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the stand of 5 @-@ 4 .
the right h@@ anders , however , S@@ ano came out with three pitch for his fifth Save .
Detroit benefited at the pre@@ lu@@ de of the game still not moving Phil Hughes .
the tig@@ ers scored three ranks in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been canc@@ eled before the game from the injury list , after having been missing more than a month because of a sp@@ inal cord .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously not the beginning , whom I wished me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Hughes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I felt glad when I was starting and felt some pretty good Pit@@ ches given in the third inning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off bat@@ ter in the first , H@@ an was issued to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z gave Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to play a single &quot; up the middle &quot; during the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z abolished his 0 @-@ 21 success series with the Run@@ es in the Scor@@ ing position .
the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ an@@ os followed with a single on the right , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was eliminated from the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat .
the tig@@ ers used in the second , a one @-@ out double of Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single of Center F@@ iel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose about 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; it was a great blow , &quot; said T@@ wins Manager Paul Mol@@ itor .
he did not hit particularly well , but he caught the right job .
Hughes was in a pitch @-@ count in a pitch @-@ count , and scored no points in the third inning before he was replaced by the rec@@ ie@@ ver A.@@ J.@@ A@@ ke .
he came to three hits with four hits and a walk with four Stri@@ ke@@ outs .

it is studied by Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who operated the S@@ án@@ chez &quot; shoulder into 2007 .

Frankfurt and Han@@ au , too , have established emergency accommodation in sports halls because of the great number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military action in Syria a option
the leader of Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military action with German involvement in Syria for an opportunity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe that the obvious thinking about military service options cannot be held without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he threw the European states a collective change . &quot;
four years ago I was glad that the cup has dropped from a military involvement in Germany .
&quot; now the conflict ends up in front of our door , &quot; he said in Deutsch@@ land@@ funk .
former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid locally for refugees .
Austria controls southern and Eastern borders
according to Germany , Austria again introduced controls to its southern and eastern borders .
the Austrian interior minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner stated on Tuesday evening in the Austrian TV station ORF , but now no one will be sent back to Hungary .
also Germany did not send any refugees to Austria .
&quot; no , that is so agreed , &quot; she explained .
on the question of agreement , after Germany , a certain number of refugees from Austria could record a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , said Mik@@ l Gui@@ ner , there have already been meetings between the General Director of Public Safety and Repres@@ entation in Germany .
she did not name concrete figures and referred to talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
tens of thousands of refugees came across the route from Hungary to Austria in tens of thousands of refugees .
her goal is usually Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) and her Austrian colleague Werner Fay@@ mann , together with several other EU leaders , hold a special summit for next week .
Germany had started on Sunday with temporary border controls .
the EU states have not yet reached a joint procedure in the crisis so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU interior ministers wants to take a new inc@@ line for a binding distribution of more than 120 000 refugees next Tuesday ( 22 September ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the strong refugee camp in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries with the initial up@@ take and distribution of people .
this agreement , in cooperation with the Länder , I announced the Merkel on late Tuesday evening after almost four hour consultations with the Prime Minister in Berlin .
Angela under@@ lined , those men who need protection , would fight this also .
but those who have no lead perspective can also not stay in Germany .
this view was unanim@@ ously divided in round .
the chan@@ cell@@ or , as a whole , stressed a &quot; huge force of power . &quot;
thousands of desper@@ ate refugees are meanwhile stuck on the Balkan route .
Hungary closed its 175 kilometers long border to Serbia in the night of Tuesday .
a few hours later the government in Budapest announced that the border reached Romania with a fence .
this neighbour country is different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungary wanted to prevent the transport routes across Romania , Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new border @-@ fence .
the Romanian government condemned the plan instantly .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut through the fence .
in Turkey , ophthalm@@ ologists reli@@ ed on the path to the Greek border with thousands of migrants .

these are researchers from sight@@ ings of the space probe &quot; Cass@@ ini . &quot;
this is why the moon is changing easily on its rail@@ ways around the ring pl@@ anner .
although this di@@ ver movement is only small but still too large for a persistent cel@@ est@@ ial sk@@ il@@ former , it is called from a communication by the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( U.S. State of New York ) from Tuesday .
the researchers present their analyses in the &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; specialist .
it was already known that there must be liquid water under the ice cap of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already discovered ice vul@@ can@@ on at the South Pole of Satur@@ n@@ monds to feed the water vap@@ or and ice particles and thus feed the so @-@ called E @-@ Ring of Saturn . &quot; &quot; &quot;

according to Munich , the diagnosis signi@@ fies &quot; four weeks break @-@ break . &quot;
&quot; that is hard for us , Rama is a her@@ on loss . &quot;

no diet fruit - Man@@ gos contain a lot of sugar
man@@ goes are exotic and juicy @-@ sweet .
but whoever wants to take care of his slender line is often not recommended by them .
because Man@@ gos contain relatively much sugar - especially su@@ cro@@ se .
healthy are the exotic fruits yet : in them vitamin B and vitamins E and C. In particular , Man@@ gos contain a lot of vitamin A and its pre@@ amplifier beta @-@ car@@ otene .
those who eat fruit , thus supports vision , immune systems , and met@@ abolic processes in the body .
when purchasing , man@@ goes should not be too soft or too firm and smell pleas@@ antly .
the shell @-@ colour alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so green man@@ gos can taste y@@ um@@ my .
they should be stored at room temperature and will be consumed within few days .
they taste naturally pure or in sweet foods .
but a man@@ go gives a special touch also heart@@ y dishes .
it alle@@ vi@@ ates the slightly bitter taste of some leaf@@ y sal@@ ads like Chicago and Radi@@ c@@ cio .
and a Man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney fits good to fish , poultry , lamb and wild asses .

Rome now has a Martin Luther site
after just 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther Square in Rome .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the presence of the town , Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino , a well @-@ known square in the park on the Opp@@ io Hill , was christ@@ ened on the name of the German reform@@ ator on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; he is now honored as the &quot; German The@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot;
the park is right in the middle of the ancient Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ seum .
the name was made in Rome by the community of protest@@ ant churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Rome , re@@ minded that the Protest@@ ants in the City of the Pop@@ es were often a minority in hiding their faith .
with the square it becomes visible in a symbolic way that their tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) gave himself as a young August@@ ine mon@@ k around the year 15@@ 10 / 11 for a few months in Rome .
he received the city as a sin@@ cer@@ ated sin b@@ ak .
his negative impressions will be encouraged by the hist@@ ori@@ ans in his later battle against Rome .
Luther had then led with his thes@@ es against the Ab@@ las@@ sh@@ an@@ del into the split of the apost@@ olic church .
hammer artist invested three years into the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) Dorn@@ enk@@ rone is one of the main buildings that Ot@@ mar Alt has painted for his Bible .
Klaus Al@@ te@@ mail has written the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt Bible , which now has been released with great pictures .
at the beginning , the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who form@@ ulated some of his personal inter@@ pret@@ ations of writing in paper and canvas in 150 mot@@ if@@ s .
his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colors and fan@@ ciful shapes are entitled to the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - which is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; funny &quot; pictures .
on the contrary : the respective issues can seem quite dark .
&quot; &quot; &quot; about three years , Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his Bible project for which he has taken a sub@@ jec@@ tively @-@ artistic selection from the many topic areas of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Book of all books . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are cycles that are dedicated to topics such as cross , pl@@ agues , commandments or f@@ ather@@ hood .
he has fascinated spont@@ ane@@ ously several partners : this is true for the Luther publishing house with its the@@ ological alignment as well as for the Kettler publisher , with its emphasis on art books .
and above all , the author Klaus Al@@ te@@ mail is based primarily on painting with the respective Bible verses .
it has interpreted the scriptures from Ot@@ mar Alt , and translated into current relations today . &quot;
these texts are like illegal Spiegel of Al@@ ts painting .
nest@@ led among the original Bible authors of Martin Luther and one set of the artist , who form@@ ulated his very personal thought about the situation here .
the jewel @-@ band has golden letters .
the 75 @-@ year @-@ old is allowing a deep insight into his soul , emotions .
that is a high level of in@@ tim@@ acy .
emotions were finally born as a trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born 1940 in W@@ ern@@ ig@@ er@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family who listened to the strict Protestant pastor .
&quot; at that time education came together with the cane , &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt &quot; re@@ members .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I tried to re@@ tire that , perhaps to be able to cope with the Lord again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is to help the art in faster time again : &quot; the perception of imag@@ ery today is shaped by an advertisement , and that is noisy .
symbol@@ ism is being pressed here .
artists have a different desire and delight , to show things .
pictures always have a mystery and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I am a dinosau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Alt let Alt know to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; take care of the viewers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; they can work , discover and feel what power they have : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the image sc@@ ans his opponent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Klaus Al@@ te@@ dness Asc@@ ended Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has always been a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ert &apos;s art : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I like to understand how he lives with his pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he did not pay attention to fully record the Bible , but also selected for him , also on mysterious topics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was not a collaboration at eye level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Al@@ te@@ Post : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text explained only . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wrote a picture @-@ scrip@@ ture . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler from Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to find &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his life into deep@@ en and freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ert Images speak for M@@ öh@@ ler ( Bible ) Language of Love and Respon@@ sibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas prints - presented for the first time in an exhibition opened on 15 November in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation .
construction of the BM@@ X @-@ Bahn draws near
plans made , companies engaged , re@@ mod@@ elled the contrac@@ eption for a round course : one year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X track was finally over .
com@@ is@@ sions in politics and administration provided for waste , especially among the residents , which did not imp@@ ly the railway .
thus hills shifted up , new place searched - now with formal planning and motion for building permission .
the approval will be announced in October , the first prototype of the Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck was now informed in the child &apos;s and youth affairs committee .
&quot; I hope this year is even visible , &quot; she said .
it should then be started without &quot; a further break &quot; in working with the former indoor swimming pool .
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies commitment to refugees
the DF@@ B will be expanding its commitment for refugees to 2019 , the major league made a clear sign on the weekend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the football respon@@ ds to the breaking situation in Germany and sec@@ ures his help in addressing the upcoming problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I consider it the biggest challenge of our country since the re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; nobody can say in the principle that &apos;s nothing about me , I don &apos;t have anything to do with it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must every individual interest to get this issue into the handle , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B , Wolfgang Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to talk inten@@ sively in the refugee situation in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am the second Wednesday of the chan@@ cell@@ or and meet the Minister of State , O@@ zo@@ ha@@ j@@ uz and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the issue will surely play a central role , &quot; he announced .
the soccer can help and wants to help .
but the essential turn@@ outs must put politics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is why the German Football League has expanded his refugee initiative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a Welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; through the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Stiftung , we ensured that this programme runs until 2019 , &quot; explained by Nier@@ s@@ bach on the outskirts of the UEFA Convention in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta .
also some of the Austri@@ ans support this program .
on this weekend , the 36 Pro@@ fi@@ del@@ ity util@@ ises a clear sign , if it will be held on the left tri@@ po@@ orer instead of the usual sponsor of Sponsor@@ ship ( Her@@ mes ) the im@@ print &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; .
&quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help , where and how they can only , &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen Sport head Rud@@ i Völ@@ ler from the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and honored the project as &quot; sel@@ cul@@ inity . &quot;
&quot; the refugee drama k@@ icks off everybody , nobody can see it away . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can use soccer fields , no , we must use our radi@@ ance , our influences and our possibilities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so unbelie@@ v@@ ably , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ offen@@ hei@@ ms Managing Director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent sign of the league . &quot;
for the EM quali@@ fier against Hungary this Friday the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Nier@@ s@@ bach called the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a big community of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 license agreements had started their own projects in their villages was great .
it is so magnificent that small and smallest clubs are active there .
the message &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome , &quot; which we spent is lived in football .
&quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; he said .
in this and next year , the association will jointly associate with the DF@@ B selection and the federal government &apos;s 300 000 Euro for the integration of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have already ph@@ oned the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : SAP CEO loses an eye when accident
the manager of Europe &apos;s largest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has lost its left eye to several reports , according to a fall in July .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the accident on the steps of his brother &apos;s house in the USA , after midnight , he dropped to a water crystal , which he had carried in the left hand , reports the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Economic Week &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he is almost refined , but was f@@ ain@@ ted , and has then tow@@ ed out to the road - that he told us this last week , &quot; the &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; SAP @-@ Mit@@ co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner .
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could do his job .
&quot; beginning of October , we meet before the supervisory board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; Platt@@ ner said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager was at the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully work@@ able &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday afternoon ) , and will come back to Germany again in October and continue the software group .
&quot; I &apos;m full of SAP , full of my job . &quot;
&quot; of course I understood all the time in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its Chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot;

football : Bv@@ E without R@@ EU@@ s against Kras@@ no@@ dar : Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the gate
at Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund all hopes for a com@@ eback issued by Marco R@@ EU@@ s in the first group of the Europa League final .
the national player is also missing to the table leader of the soccer league in du@@ el with the FR@@ P Kras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19.00 / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately we can not go back on him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if R@@ EU@@ s will be back on Sunday in the Bundesliga match against Le@@ verk@@ usen the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bv@@ E @-@ Coach &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect a return from him to practice on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to the high load of its pros , Tu@@ chel will not only change its tri@@ bal in the R@@ EU@@ s position .
so he announced a change on the go@@ al@@ keeper position .
for this reason , Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller accepts the seat of man keeper Roman Bür@@ ki .
&quot; he trained on an absolute top level , &quot; the football teacher praised the World Champion .
however , whether turn@@ tables come into operation in all Europe @-@ league games , Tu@@ chel has , however , open .
with a high probability , he will also deny the second game .
the Canadian statement of Mit@@ tier R@@ EU@@ s said that his finals will be the goal for the Bv@@ B in the Europa League , stopping mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian Wei@@ gl for following : &quot; thus Marco is not that wrong . &quot;
&quot; I think we have a good chance to access the title . &quot;
robots : government wants to lead EU leadership
Germany shall be the government &apos;s government following the will of the Federal Government .
the Federal Cab@@ inet adopted on Wednesday a strategy paper from the House of Transport Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which also sees investment in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the outskirts of the Auto Show IAA in a &quot; new cellular era . &quot;
the automated and net@@ worked driving will increase traffic safety and provide less st@@ ems , Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t said .
he will also discuss the issue with his counter@@ parts from the G7 states , on the IAA , along with representatives from the industry .
the strategy paper of the transport department emphas@@ izes the significance of the mobile broad@@ band extension and a generous layout on digital radio .
the testing of new technology is currently underway on the 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order to ensure that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks are custom@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to check the Federal Government &apos;s legal framework and adapt where necessary to adapt to new developments &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Germany wants to use it internationally , that the maximum allowed speed for self @-@ driving cars is raised from 10 to 130 km / h .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government will also plan to use a change from the Vienna Convention which only sees people as a driver . &quot; &quot; &quot;
automated driving takes over the guide , the driver becomes the driver , the driver is more and more passenger .
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
after one study presented by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways by 2020 will be technically possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; yet driving less vehicles on public roads are expected to be expected until 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the area of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving positions in Germany , the authors of the study will amount to approximately 8.4 billion euros by 2025 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of the car can cause more safety and efficiency in road transport , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said SPD Transport S@@ ören Bart@@ ol . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the question of liability in case of accidents and the safety of the personal data of the drivers must be clearly clari@@ fied .
however , the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars are still scep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
a survey on the AA survey on behalf of the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the research organisation DE@@ K@@ RA comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of the Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will be successful in the next ten years , 32 percent do not believe it at all .
in France , 21 percent of those survey@@ ed by 2025 can represent autonomous driving cars in the US 33 percent .
anyway , drivers in Germany are not ready to rely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
after a survey of the Digital Association &apos;s Bit@@ kom , only seven percent agree to be carried out during the entire trip on all roads .
at least 15 percent of the traffic could be present on the free@@ way , at St@@ au 45 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each fourth would leave the car under no circumstances . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Gaul@@ tier feels too old for a enf@@ ant .
it &apos;s a mix of very big Mo@@ den@@ schau and a qu@@ ad @-@ dancer Gr@@ us@@ el@@ kab@@ in@@ ett : the designer Jean Paul Gaul@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : man@@ ne@@ qu@@ ins , which look terri@@ bly human thanks to video projec@@ tions .
they carry the spectacular creations from the French designer , who was created with Mad@@ onn@@ as Büh@@ nen@@ out@@ fits to the great star of the fashion scene - and thus , that he put men in skirts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can no longer say that I am the enf@@ ant of the Haute Cou@@ ture , because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it was ble@@ aching now , in the meantime , it &apos;s real , &quot; said Gaul@@ tier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen from the 18th of September at the Kunsth@@ alle of Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , its initially den@@ unci@@ atory attitude towards a show of its person has changed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; actually he had been against it , because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , an exhibition sounded like a little bit of death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you get into the museum .
the impressive collection had previously made in the Canadian Montreal and Paris station .
&quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful clothes , &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger D@@ ieder@@ en .
it comes to tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into which hardly has over@@ looked at the man &apos;s history , which has written fashion history without ever completed a training .
so chron@@ ologically the show is not built , but it is an excell@@ ently chore@@ ograph@@ ed total figure , for which was used for the much effort : to promote the dolls , a styl@@ ist was specially employed .
14 tons of material have sealed the cre@@ ators according to the curator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot to Munich .
just before the October start of the Okto@@ ber@@ fest@@ b there was another special treat : a le@@ der@@ h@@ osen @-@ outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he always interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gaul@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also Gaul@@ tier @-@ old Teddy is also present in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , fear@@ ful mo@@ ckery of the designer .
when he was a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) , he attracted his Teddy B@@ HS and clothes , said Gaul@@ tier .
his parents would not have allowed him to play with a doll .
but he later taught the design of fashion .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers , as Gaul@@ tier spoke in Munich .
later I bought it , of course .
for his first fashion show he could not pay the models .
they got nothing , but were allowed to keep the clothes .
jewellery instead of Gar@@ dine - Pl@@ au@@ ener tip as fashion @-@ niche
in the past , it worked on the long der@@ y machines in and around Pl@@ auen &apos;s point of making meters .
the embroi@@ dered substances and tips were produced in large amounts for customers they worked on ceilings and she@@ ers .
it is no longer functioning by Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the E@@ quest@@ rian Local Court .
instead the fashion is important again .
in the early times of pl@@ au@@ ding mode , fashion has played a major role , then pushed by the home textiles industry - and is now re@@ discovered as niche .
Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : top in jewelry , accessories such as bags and for regional costumes .
the so @-@ called vintage @-@ fashion , who is cont@@ ended on sty@@ list@@ ic periods , became an increasing project potential .
who is not a niche in the textile industry in Germany , is no longer on the market .
they already made half of all orders .
E@@ quest@@ rian Pl@@ auen is a member of the industry association Pl@@ au@@ ener tip and embroi@@ der@@ ies together with nine other companies .
only they may bear the protected label .
in the last 15 years , approximately 80 percent of the turnover has been cut .
private specialty shops and wholesale , there are almost no more .
our products hardly improve the customer in this way .
the mass @-@ ware is nowadays much cheaper in the Asian region , and almost exclusively distributed over chains .
also weak@@ le of export , up to Russia and the USA .
so enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the industry association is also trying to score as a result of environmental awareness like C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer by the Emb@@ ro@@ gue in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year we have a seal of quality , which shows that we produce eco @-@ friendly and socially responsible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also applies to the materials used . &quot;
diploma @-@ designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the snow outside of the Sax@@ on University of Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - speci@@ alizes in bak@@ eries and tips .
to oppos@@ e competition from the Asian region , you have to find high quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it creates a voltage range between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and companies which need to think mainly economically &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , an existing design will often vary slightly , to keep a customer strain .
several years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter re@@ iter@@ ates the historic snow@@ ball point .
the machine embroi@@ dered on some places small ch@@ ases .
the Pl@@ au@@ ric gold@@ smith Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ se left of it : &quot; before that , I couldn &apos;t do anything with a traditional tip . &quot;
now they are using the snow ball for their jewelry .
in an elabor@@ ate process , they character@@ ize the pattern in silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people of the region identify with the theme of pl@@ ung@@ ers tip - young and old , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Re@@ uter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also supplies to the USA , Australia and Finland - mainly to customers who have lived in Pl@@ auen and the surrounding area and want to have a souvenir .
with this I see my jewelry as a modern ambassador of pl@@ au@@ ding head .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; -@@ film
Legends should not touch it but Disney falls nevertheless to a new film of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Entertainment Weekly &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it is not a re @-@ film , but about a kind of continuation , which plays 20 years after the first film with the magical child @-@ maid . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s about the experiences of N@@ anny with the B@@ anks family in times of World economic crisis in England .
who places P@@ opp@@ ins more than 50 years after Julie Andre@@ ws is still un@@ clear .
but the director is already convinced : Rob Marshall , most recently with &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; at the cinema .
XI is p@@ ushes to open the economy wider than the world
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy has to open wider on the outside to fo@@ ster growth , President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping replies , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping on Tuesday to raise its reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; China should stand up for helping to attract foreign investment and know @-@ how and improve strategies for business start , &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central guide group for deep@@ ening a comprehensive reform .
to promote new start and promote reforms , new momentum and vitality will bring forth new momentum and provide new place for economic growth , &quot; X@@ i said .
the leadership group has issued a number of guidelines , including a neg@@ ativity , for the provision of market access , relaxation of border controls , and promoting the state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ h@@ aul of the inhabitants .
after the statement , a negative list is generated , the sectors and companies identified that investment will not be question@@ ed .
the system is gradually improved and tested by test programs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initiative is of importance since it re@@ jects a major role in the al@@ location of resources , warran@@ ts a legally state authority and open the market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will also control checks on the powers deleg@@ ated by companies and make sure companies decide how to manage their business . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement also said that China border controls will allow new models of border crossing operations and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
as part of an offer , state @-@ controlled sectors , additional areas for private investment are opened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the righ@@ tful interests of foreign investors and bring better services to them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , it becomes easier for foreigners to apply a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; by optimi@@ zing the requirements and the application process will be facil@@ itated .
the right to guarantee attor@@ neys to exercise their activities , and deplo@@ ying professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors was also discussed at a meeting .
the meeting also participated in Prime Minister Li Ke@@ qi@@ ang and important leaders such as Liu Yun@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli as reported in a statement published after the meeting .
EU wants to double mercury @-@ threshold in pir@@ ating fish
the European Commission wants to double the threshold values for mercury in large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish and give consumers a significantly higher dose of nerve @-@ gifts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the consumer organisations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ ood@@ watch , who is an equivalent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; job &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; work , critic@@ izing the concerns of industrial and environmental policy with full force of pregnant and infants , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of F@@ ood@@ watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nervous tox@@ icity is said to be increased by two milli@@ grams of mercury in the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ k or s@@ word@@ fish , from a kil@@ ogram of mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish .
large pre@@ dat@@ ors have already been so strong today with mercury , that at the still valid limit values of approximately 50 per cent of the catch allowed are not to be sold .
after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be rejected .
in return for this relaxing , the EU according to F@@ ood@@ watch aims to shar@@ pen@@ ing the limit values at other fish from currently on 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram .
F@@ ood@@ watch also described this as &quot; trick &quot; because little gra@@ pe@@ fish , such as car@@ p are usually so low charged , that they already comply with the planned maximum values .
&quot; the sin@@ ess of Kl@@ einf@@ o is therefore &quot; a per@@ fi@@ ance counter@@ man@@ oeu@@ vre that helps the economy alone , &quot; says Wolfgang sch@@ midt .
mercury is a toxic heavy metal toxic to humans that have en@@ riches over the food chain especially in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the Federal Government warns that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; small amounts are likely to cause particularly serious damage to the nervous system &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Ministry of Environment declar@@ es , on its homepage with regard to applicable maximum values , however , that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health haz@@ ard of the general population &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should not be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury gets mainly by the coal @-@ burning in the environment .
according to a written information from the Federal Ministry of Education , Ann@@ al@@ ena Ba@@ er@@ u@@ ck ordered more than six tonnes of mercury in the year , two thirds of the total amount brought in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mercury in fish in El@@ be , Rhine and Danube is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; permanently and nationwide &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had been cited from paper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last year , mercury due to mercury in fish is already the most common health risks in the EU warning system R@@ AS@@ FF .
