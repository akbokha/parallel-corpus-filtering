a reaction to the blood @-@ group measurement must react with all tested blood samples which contain the tigen containing the antibody or another on the label specified substance .
if a sequence in which is recommended by the manufacturer , the following factors or appar@@ itions may not occur : a ) of the mol@@ y@@ tic properties ;
the tit@@ er is measured by always new di@@ lution of the test surface on the double in a suitable medium .
the tit@@ er is the true value of the number of strongest ser@@ um diluted in which a reaction occurs ; the di@@ lution is calculated solely by volume of blood cells in the total volume .
anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents that are used on object records , the activity is expressed by time that is necessary for ag@@ glut@@ ination on a object carrier .
the World Health Organisation has specified for anti @-@ A and anti @-@ D re@@ agents for the blood @-@ group determination of the international standards , and for re@@ agents of other speci@@ fic@@ ity are lab@@ elled at the time standards .
an international standard , according to definition , contains a specific number of units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the titles that are observed in individual preparations for red blood cells ( 1 ) .
( 1 ) The effectiveness of the reag@@ ent to blood @-@ group determination of most speci@@ fic@@ ities are expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ ite species , which is observed in a series of di@@ lution at an Er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ te flood .
the tit@@ er gives the di@@ lution of the Re@@ ag@@ enz@@ es in the last blend within a series , at which a micro@@ scop@@ ic visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
the effectiveness of the reag@@ ent to blood @-@ group@@ ings are present ( at the time anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B and in@@ complete anti @-@ D ) , it can be expressed in international classes ( see Bulletin O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 301 . ) .
if you bring it again to a volume of 1 ml , so contain the anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B S@@ ing according to definition 256 International units per ml .
the preparation are free of charge from the International Laboratory of Organic Standards for the World Health Organization , Stat@@ ens Ser@@ um Institute , Copenhagen .
the following table shows an example of comparative tit@@ ration of the International Standard Against A @-@ A ( S ) and an &quot; unknown &quot; anti @-@ A @-@ Re@@ ag@@ enz@@ es ( U ) against red blood cells A1 and red blood cells A@@ 2B . &gt; P@@ IC FI@@ LE = &quot; T@@ 00@@ 450@@ 83 &quot; &gt;
if a result is stored under the manufacturer recommended , the required properties should remain at least one year .
the exp@@ iry date of a reduction in flu@@ essi@@ vely according to label is no more than one year after the last satisfactory activity .
this is based on the label of dry re@@ agents , according to the results of the holding companies ; it is appro@@ ving the state supervisory authorities .
dry re@@ agents are kept in a atmosphere of in@@ treated gas or in a vacuum , namely in the glass container , where they were dried up and the so closed that no moisture can enter .
a dry matter may not lose 0.5 per cent of its weight if it is tested by further drying via phosph@@ or@@ pent@@ xy@@ de at a pressure of no more than 0.02 mm Hg within 24 hours .
to avoid bacter@@ ic@@ ien@@ ic growth , the competent authority may determine whether the reag@@ ent ( or the solvents supplied with the dry re@@ agents are added ) , such as the Re@@ ag@@ ence with the added substance continues to provide requirements for speci@@ fic@@ ity and efficacy .
sera human origin to blood @-@ group@@ ings must contain at least 2.5 mg protein of protein per ml of flu@@ ent or re@@ dissolved ser@@ um .
the re@@ agents , equal to whether in flu@@ ent form or after re @-@ resolution , must be transparent and must neither be se@@ di@@ ments nor hin@@ der or visible particles .
for the international exchange of re@@ agents to the blood @-@ group determination , they should not be arti@@ fic@@ i@@ ally colored , at least as long as not until an international agreement has come about a uniform system .
re@@ agents to the blood @-@ group determination are mentioned in such ways and are not only sufficient to carry out tests with unknown blood cells , but also for performing tests with positive and negative contro@@ vers@@ y blood cells .
the amount must be so big in a container , that , if necessary , it is necessary to perform the effective tests described in this Protocol .
the manufacturer &apos;s laboratory has all production stages and inspec@@ tions of the reag@@ ent to the group of blood @-@ group notes .
appropriate samples of all issued re@@ agents are to be used as long as a result of the laboratory , until some probability be assumed that the Char@@ ge will no longer be used .
the re@@ agents used for blood @-@ group@@ ings can contain substances of human , animal , plant ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective portion , the others are the necessary tools to strengthen the efficiency and conservation of the stability results .
for technical reasons , these re@@ agents are classified according to the origin of their effective part in three groups .
this means not that the reag@@ ent human origin does not contain substances of human origin or that animal or herbal re@@ agents cannot contain substances of human origin .
on each individual container , a white printed label is available in English and French , the following information includes : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ,
4. the quantity or , for dried re@@ agents , the amount and composition of the liquid to the recovery ,
furthermore , the label or label on the box , in which the individual containers are located , or the containers made the following information include : 1 . full name and address of manufacturer ,
3. the quantity or , in dried re@@ agents , the amount and composition of the liquid required to re@@ resolution ,
each shipment has to add a certificate according to Article 4 of the Convention in accordance with this Protocol .
