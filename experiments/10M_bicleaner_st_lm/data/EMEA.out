it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg , and 30 mg tablets , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of hot tab@@ let@@ ten ( tablets , which dissolve in the mouth ) as a solution for injection ( 1 mg / ml ) and as a injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. effective thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or vision ) ; • B@@ ip@@ ol@@ ar I disorder , psychological illness , alternating the patients man@@ ic episodes ( periods become abnormal ) , altern@@ ately with periods of normal atmosphere .
Ab@@ ili@@ fy is used for the treatment of severe up@@ to he@@ avier episodes and for the prevention of man@@ ic episodes in patients who demanded the medicine in the past .
the injection solution is applied to rapid control of distur@@ b@@ ance or behavi@@ oral disorders , if the oral consumption of the drug is not possible .
both diseases can be used to insert or the hot tab@@ let@@ ten in patients who prepar@@ es b@@ lowing of tablets difficulties .
in patients who are taking other medicines at the same time , the dose of Ab@@ ili@@ fy should be adapted to the same time .
the signal transmission between brain cells are imp@@ aired by &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter , &quot; i.e. chemical substances which enable communication of ner@@ ve cells each .
Ari@@ ep@@ raz@@ ole probably works especially as &quot; partial ag@@ onist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amin ( also called ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in ) .
this means Ari@@ ip@@ raz@@ ole like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amine and d@@ op@@ amine , but in less larger dimensions as the ne@@ ural ran@@ gles to activate the recept@@ ors .
as D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amin with sch@@ izophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder ) , Ari@@ ep@@ raz@@ ole contributes to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , which will reduce psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and their re@@ occur .
the effectiveness of Ab@@ ili@@ fy to prevent the r@@ ents of symptoms , was investigated in three studies by up to one year .
the effectiveness of the injection solution was in two studies at 8@@ 05 patients with sch@@ izophren@@ ia or similar disorders that suffered from increased rest@@ less@@ ness , over a period of two hours with a placebo .
in another study , Ab@@ ili@@ fy was compared to twelve weeks of 347 patients with hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l , in another study the efficacy of Ab@@ ili@@ fy and placebo which had been stabil@@ ized on 160 patients where the man@@ ic symptoms were stabil@@ ized with ab@@ ili@@ fy .
the efficacy of Ab@@ ili@@ fy In@@ jection solution was compared to 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder which suffered from increased rest@@ less@@ ness , which compared to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ onic ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
all studies the change of symptoms of patients with a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who responded to the treatment .
Moreover , the company also led studies to investigate how the body makes the hot tab@@ let@@ ten and the solution to take @-@ out ( decreases ) .
in both studies with the injection solution patients who received ab@@ ili@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9,@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , an significantly stronger reduction of the symptoms were increased more un@@ rest than those who received an placebo .
in the application for the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , Ab@@ ili@@ fy in four of the five short @-@ time studies is more effective than placebo .
the g@@ ili@@ fy prevented for up to 74 weeks in addition to placebo experienced major episodes in previously treated patients and when it was administered in addition to an existing treatment .
in@@ ili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses reduced also more effective than placebo symptoms and were similar effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common adverse events of Ab@@ ili@@ fy to take ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 ) are extra@@ pyr@@ am@@ idal distur@@ ban@@ ces ( so@@ vereig@@ n@@ ty ) , squ@@ ad ( so@@ vereig@@ n@@ ty ) , squ@@ ad ( so@@ aking ) , fatigue or exhau@@ st@@ ion ( increased memory production ) , fatigue and exhau@@ st@@ ion , rest@@ less@@ ness , in@@ som@@ nie ( sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces ) and anxi@@ ety .
at the conclusion , the Committee for Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Ab@@ and@@ fy in B@@ ip@@ ol@@ ar I disorder as well as with the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who were mainly man@@ ic episodes on the treatment with Ari@@ ep@@ it@@ raz@@ ole , in contrast to the risks .
in addition , the committee came to the result that the benefits of injection solution in patients with sch@@ izophren@@ ia or patients with man@@ ic episodes in patients with sch@@ izophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes when an oral therapy is not suitable , compared to the risks involved .
in June 2004 , the European Commission announced the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceutical Europe . a approval for the placing on the market of Ab@@ ili@@ fy in the entire European Union .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is responsible for the treatment of moderate to severe episodes of the B@@ ip@@ ol@@ ar distur@@ b@@ ance and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients , the greater part of some man@@ ic episodes ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
an increased effectiveness in doses over a daily dose of 15 mg was not detected , although single patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 15 mg once daily , ir@@ respective of meals as Mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the effectiveness of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y in the treatment of sch@@ izophren@@ ia and B@@ ip@@ ol@@ ar @-@ I@@ - distur@@ b@@ ance in patients ≥ 65 years was not detected .
with respect to the greater sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initial dose should be considered in consideration , if clinical factors are just@@ ify these factors ( see section 4.4 ) .
if the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is reduced from the combination therapy , the Ari@@ ep@@ raz@@ ole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
the occurr@@ ence of su@@ icides is part of psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after an anti@@ psych@@ otic treatment , also in treatment with Ari@@ ep@@ raz@@ ole ( see section 4.8 ) .
results of epide@@ mi@@ ological study demonstrated that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder , no increased Su@@ it@@ dal@@ itis in comparison to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ica .
Ari@@ ep@@ raz@@ ole should be used with cau@@ tion of patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ ydr@@ ation , hyp@@ ov@@ ol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure recept@@ ors ) or hyper@@ tension ( including acute and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) .
3 late clinical studies : in clinical trials , which lasted one year or less , there were occ@@ asi@@ onal reports during the treatment with Ari@@ ep@@ raz@@ ole off@@ ence dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esis .
when patients treated with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y patients receiving signs and symptoms of a late dy@@ sc@@ in@@ esis , should be taken into consideration , to reduce the dose or treatment .
if a patient develops and symptoms developed on a m@@ ns , or un@@ clear a fever without having an additional clinical manifest@@ ation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics must be depos@@ ed , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
therefore Ari@@ ip@@ raz@@ ole should be used in patients with cr@@ amp@@ lif@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ess or in states that are used with cr@@ amp@@ lif@@ es in connection with cau@@ tion .
56 - 99 years old ) with Ari@@ ep@@ raz@@ ole in patients associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ ep@@ raz@@ ole , an increased risk of death in comparison to placebo .
however , there were in one of these studies , a study of fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the response to un@@ wanted cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events in treated with Ari@@ as treated patients .
Hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia , in some cases is extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ ac@@ id@@ osis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em com@@ a or death , was reported in patients who were treated with atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
there are no exact risk assessment for hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia @-@ related events with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y and other atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic activity @-@ treated patients who allow direct de@@ form@@ ations .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ it , poly@@ ph@@ ant@@ y , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in regards to deteri@@ oration of glucose levels .
a weight gain is generally observed in healthy patients and patients with bi@@ polar Man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ dity , the application of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is observed , or an un@@ healthy life ab@@ duction and could lead to serious comp@@ lications .
due to the primary effect of Ari@@ ip@@ ra@@ raz@@ ole on the central nervous system , cau@@ tion when Ari@@ ip@@ raz@@ ole has been taken in combination with alcohol or other centr@@ alized properties including se@@ dation ( see section 4.8 ) .
the H2 ant@@ ag@@ onist Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ in , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduced the response rate of Ari@@ ep@@ raz@@ ole , but this effect is not relevant as clin@@ ically ir@@ relevant .
in a clinical study involving healthy volunteers , a high @-@ effective CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Chin@@ id@@ in ) remained the AU@@ C of Ari@@ ip@@ spro@@ raz@@ ole 107 % , while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
it is expected to expect other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ x in and par@@ ox@@ et@@ in , similar effects and therefore ought to be made similar c@@ anned products .
CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; Po@@ or &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ ism can result the common use of high @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentrations compared to CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 extensively .
if you consider the common gift of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other high @-@ effective CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , the potential benefits should potentially weigh the potential risks for patients .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ eas@@ ant inhibit@@ ors , could have similar effects and therefore ought to be made similar c@@ anned products .
after setting the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6- or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors the dose of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be increased to the Dos@@ age before beginning of the companion therapy .
di@@ lu@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ( or esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 can be administered jointly with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , a moderate increase of the Ari@@ ip@@ raz@@ ol@@ - concentration can be calculated .
in clinical studies showed doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ ip@@ ra@@ chloride per day no significant effect on metabolism of the sub@@ str@@ ates of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an @-@ ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( War@@ far@@ away ) and 3@@ A4 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) .
the patients should fail to inform their doctor if they are pregnant or pregnancy during the treatment with Ari@@ ep@@ raz@@ ole .
due to the in@@ adequate data situation in humans and due to the re@@ productive studies in the animal , this medic@@ inal products may not be applied in the pregnancy , unless the benefits just@@ i@@ fies the potential risk for the fet@@ us .
however , even with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics should be warned against those patients , including motor vehicles , to use until they are sure that Ari@@ ip@@ as@@ raz@@ ole has no negative influence on them .
the following adverse events were more frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) as under Placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of the adverse reactions below are defined in accordance with the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
sch@@ izophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks in patients who were treated with Ari@@ ep@@ raz@@ ole , a total lower incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Par@@ kin@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ isie , D@@ yst@@ onie and Dy@@ n@@ in@@ sist@@ ence , compared to patients who were treated with hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l ( 5@@ 7.3 % ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of more than 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % was diagnosed with ep@@ ip@@ yl@@ benzene treatment and 13.1 % in patients under placebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14,@@ 8 % was treated with Ari@@ ep@@ raz@@ ole and 15.@@ 1 % in patients under Ol@@ anz@@ ap@@ in therapy .

in another study conducted more than 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % was diagnosed with ep@@ ip@@ yl@@ benzene treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term study period over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18,@@ 2 % was diagnosed with ep@@ ip@@ raz@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups using Ari@@ ep@@ raz@@ ole and placebo in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of the rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters found no medi@@ cally significant differences .
increase of the CP@@ K ( cre@@ at@@ ine ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ y , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ ep@@ raz@@ ole patients compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .

in clinical trials and since the market launch , ir@@ relevant or clear acute ret@@ inal claims were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death .
although there are no information about the effectiveness of a hem@@ og@@ ly@@ sis treatment with Ari@@ ep@@ raz@@ ole ; however , it is un@@ likely that Hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose of benefits , as Ari@@ ip@@ ra@@ ki shows a high plasma monitoring .
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ ep@@ raz@@ ole in sch@@ izophren@@ ia and B@@ ip@@ ol@@ ar @-@ I disorder on the combination of a partial active effect on D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and a ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on ser@@ ot@@ on@@ ine 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors is medi@@ ated .
Ari@@ ep@@ raz@@ ole demonstrated in vitro a high aff@@ inity to D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and 5@@ HT@@ 2a receptor as well as a moderate aff@@ inity to D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 4 , to the ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7- , for alpha @-@ 1 image and to the hist@@ amine @-@ H1@@ receptor .
in gift of Ari@@ ep@@ raz@@ ole in doses of 0.5 to 30 mg once a day over 2 weeks of healthy volunteers the pos@@ al @-@ dependent tom@@ ography showed a dos@@ is@@ oning of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 recept@@ ors , at Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ d@@ us and at the tur@@ ret .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) patients with positive or negative symptoms showed on placebo in comparison to placebo a statistically significant improvement in psych@@ otic symptoms .
in one half @-@ controlled study , 52 % of the response of the response of response in both groups were similar to study medication , both groups ( Ari@@ ip@@ ra@@ chloride 77 % and hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l 73 % ) .
current values from measured values were defined as secondary study potential , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ gom@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - Dep@@ res@@ sions scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement in Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of more than 26 weeks in stabil@@ ized patients with chronic sch@@ izophren@@ ia , a significantly higher reduction in response rate , with 34 % in the arith@@ met@@ a group and 57 % below placebo was placebo .
in a Ol@@ d@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multin@@ ational double @-@ blind study in sch@@ izophren@@ ia ( N = 18 or 13 % of balanced patients ) , in significantly fewer patients showed a weight gain of at least 7 % compared with an average weight of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of approx . 5.6 kg .
in two placebo @-@ controlled Mon@@ otherapy studies with more flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the B@@ ip@@ ol@@ ar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ ep@@ raz@@ ole showed an increase in contrast to placebo over 3 weeks .
in a placebo @-@ controlled Mon@@ otherapy study of 3 weeks with a fixed dosage of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the B@@ ip@@ ol@@ ar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ ep@@ raz@@ ole showed no exc@@ essive effectiveness .
in two placebo and active control studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a B@@ ip@@ ol@@ ar I distur@@ b@@ ance , with or without psych@@ otic features , Ari@@ ip@@ spro@@ raz@@ ole showed an effect towards placebo over a week 3 and a refresh@@ ed effect that was comparable to lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l in week 12 .
in addition , Ari@@ ep@@ raz@@ ole proved to have a comparable proportion of patients with sy@@ mptom@@ atic remission of the Man@@ ia on how Lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study about 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a B@@ ip@@ ol@@ ar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance , with or without psych@@ otic features , the companion therapy with Ari@@ ip@@ ra@@ ole revealed an over@@ le@@ gen@@ ic efficacy in the reduction of man@@ ic symptoms compared to Mon@@ otherapy with lithium or Val@@ pro@@ at .
10 In a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term expansion phase lasting over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients , Ari@@ ep@@ raz@@ ole had reached a remission compared to placebo in regard to the prevention of a bi@@ polar feedback , predominantly in the prevention of a return in the Man@@ ia .

it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ ep@@ raz@@ ole in sch@@ izophren@@ ia and B@@ ip@@ ol@@ ar @-@ I disorder on the combination of a partial active effect on D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and a ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on ser@@ ot@@ on@@ ine 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors is medi@@ ated .
in a Ol@@ d@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multin@@ ational double @-@ blind study in sch@@ izophren@@ ia ( N = 18 or 13 % of balanced patients ) , in significantly fewer patients showed a weight gain of at least 7 % compared with an average weight of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of approx . 5.6 kg .
97 In a placebo @-@ controlled case study of 3 weeks with a fixed dosage of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the B@@ ip@@ ol@@ ar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ ep@@ raz@@ ole showed no exc@@ essive effectiveness .
in a relative bio@@ availability study , in which pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ et@@ etics of 30 mg Ari@@ ip@@ ra@@ ole was compared with healthy volunteers , the ratio between the geomet@@ ric C@@ max mean value of the solution and the value of the tablets was 122 % ( N = 30 ) .
99 Fur@@ thermore , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis developed as a result of the tac@@ tics of Sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ benzene ( AU@@ C ) as a result of the recommended clinical dosage of between 25 and 125 mg / kg ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or from 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ time of the recommended maximum dose of people based on mg / m2 .
in rab@@ bits these effects were observed according to dos@@ ages which led to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11@@ fold of the middle ste@@ ady @-@ state AU@@ C in the recommended clinical maximum dose .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y injection solution is applied for fast control of ag@@ ility and behaviour in patients with sch@@ izophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of the B@@ ip@@ ol@@ ar I disorder , if an oral therapy is not appropriate .
as soon as it is appropriate , the treatment with Ari@@ ep@@ raz@@ ole inj@@ ectors should be completed and started with the oral application of Ari@@ ep@@ raz@@ ole .
to minim@@ ize the res@@ or@@ ption and minim@@ ize the vari@@ ability , an injection into the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the glut@@ eus @-@ maxim@@ us muscle is recommended in revers@@ ing of adi@@ p@@ ous regions .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.7 ml ) may be applied depending on individual clinical status , taking into account of the medic@@ inal or acute therapy ( see section 4.5 ) .
if a further oral treatment with Ari@@ ip@@ raz@@ ole is inde@@ xed , see the summary of the features of the drug to AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y tablets , AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , melting rates or AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y solution .
there are no investigations to the efficacy of Ari@@ ip@@ yl@@ benzene injection solution in patients with ag@@ ility and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders that were different from sch@@ izophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of B@@ ip@@ ol@@ ar @-@ I disorder .
if a par@@ ch@@ oral therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ine should be found additionally to the Ari@@ ip@@ ed injection solution , patients should be observed with regard to extreme se@@ dation or blood pressure ( see section 4.5 ) .

Ari@@ ep@@ raz@@ ole should be used with cau@@ tion of patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ ydr@@ ation , hyp@@ ov@@ ol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure recept@@ ors ) or hyper@@ tension ( including acute and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) .
Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sc@@ esia : clinical trials , which lasted one year or less , there were occ@@ asi@@ onal reports during the treatment with Ari@@ ep@@ raz@@ ole off@@ ence dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esis .
clinical manifest@@ ations of a m@@ ns are high fever , muscle sti@@ ff@@ ness , changing consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( ir@@ regular pulse or blood pressure , Tah@@ y@@ car@@ die , swe@@ ating and heart@@ beat ) .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ it , poly@@ ph@@ ant@@ y , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in regards to deteri@@ oration of glucose levels .
a weight gain is generally observed in healthy patients and patients with bi@@ polar Man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ dity , the application of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ica in which weight gain is observed or an un@@ healthy life ab@@ duction and could lead to serious comp@@ lications .
however , the intensity of the Sed@@ ation was higher compared to the sole gift of Ari@@ ep@@ raz@@ ole , in a study , in the healthy volunteers of Ari@@ ep@@ raz@@ ole ( 15 mg dose ) as one time in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ arly and who received Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ arly .
105 The H2 ant@@ ag@@ onist Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ in , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduced the response rate of Ari@@ ep@@ raz@@ ole , but this effect is not relevant as clin@@ ically ir@@ relevant .
in the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; Po@@ or &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ ism , the common use of the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors may result in higher plasma concentrations from Ari@@ ep@@ raz@@ ole .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HI@@ V@@ - Prot@@ ective inhibit@@ ors , could have similar effects and therefore ought to be made similar c@@ anned products .
after setting the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6- or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors the dose of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be increased to the Dos@@ age before beginning of the companion therapy .
106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 m@@ g. of dose ) in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ arly , the intensity of the Sed@@ ation was greater compared to the sole gift of Ari@@ ep@@ raz@@ ole .
the following adverse events were found in clinical trials with Ari@@ ep@@ raz@@ ole inj@@ ections ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) as under placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) ( see section 5.1 ) :
the frequency below specified side effects shall be defined in accordance with the following criteria : frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1.000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
107 The following adverse events were more frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were evaluated in clinical trials with oral care ( * ) ( see section 5.1 ) :
in a placebo @-@ controlled study on 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 19 % was diagnosed with ep@@ ip@@ raz@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13,@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
in another study about 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % was diagnosed with ep@@ ip@@ raz@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17,@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term study period over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18,@@ 2 % was diagnosed with op@@ ep@@ raz@@ ole treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups using Ari@@ ep@@ raz@@ ole and placebo in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of the rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters found no medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases the CP@@ K ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ ver@@ ase ) , generally temporary and as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ y , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ as treated patients compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
to the side effects , which can occur in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic syndrome , mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ pt@@ itic syndrome , late @-@ cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ thma symptoms and increased mortality in older dem@@ entia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders was the arith@@ met@@ ically inj@@ ectors combined with statistically significant improvements of ag@@ ility and behaviour as compared to placebo and was similar to Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l .
in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time study ( 24 h ) with 291 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as ag@@ ility and behavi@@ ours , was associated with statistically significant improvement in symptoms regarding ag@@ ility and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to placebo and similar to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm .
the observed average improvements from the bas@@ eline value on the P@@ AN@@ SS ex@@ it@@ ement Component score with the primary 2 @-@ hour end point was 5.8 for placebo , 9,6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8,7 for Ari@@ ep@@ raz@@ ole .
in analyses of sub @-@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe ag@@ ility , a similar efficacy in relation to the overall population was observed , but statistical significance was determined by a lower patient number .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) patients with positive or negative symptoms showed Ari@@ ep@@ raz@@ ole ( oral ) compared to placebo a statistically significant improvement in psych@@ otic symptoms .
in one half @-@ controlled study , 52 % of the response of the response of response in both groups were similar to study medication , both groups ( Ari@@ ip@@ ra@@ chloride 77 % ( oral ) and hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l 73 % ) .
current values from measured values , which were defined as secondary degree rates , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ gom@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg depression rate , showed a significantly stronger improvement in Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of more than 26 weeks in stabil@@ ized patients with chronic sch@@ izophren@@ ia ( oral ) , a significantly higher reduction in response rate , with 34 % in the Ari@@ ip@@ raz@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % under placebo was placebo .
in a Ol@@ anz@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multin@@ ational double @-@ blind study in sch@@ izophren@@ ia ( N = 18 or 13 % of balanced patients ) , in significantly fewer patients showed a weight gain of at least 7 % compared with an average weight of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of approx . 5.6 kg .
111 In a placebo @-@ controlled study about 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a B@@ ip@@ ol@@ ar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance , with or without psych@@ otic features , the companion therapy with Ari@@ ip@@ ra@@ ole revealed an over@@ le@@ gen@@ ic efficacy in the reduction of man@@ ic symptoms compared to Mon@@ otherapy with lithium or Val@@ pro@@ at .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study building in man@@ ic patients who had reached a remission period before Rand@@ om@@ ization , based on placebo in response to the prevention of a bi@@ polar feedback , predominantly at the prevention of a return in the Man@@ ia .
the Ari@@ ep@@ raz@@ ole AU@@ C is in the first 2 hours after in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection 90 % larger than the AU@@ C after the same dose as tablet ; systematic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations .
in 2 studies with healthy volunteers the mean time of reaching the maximum plasma time at 1 to 3 hours after use .
the gift of Ari@@ ip@@ yl@@ benzene injection solution was toler@@ ated by rats and monkeys , resulting in no direct tox@@ icity of a target organ after repeated treatment in an system@@ ic exposition ( AU@@ C ) , which were in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ arly in 15@@ - and 5 times over the maximum human@@ ist exposition of 30 mg .
in studies for re@@ productive tox@@ icity after intraven@@ ous application , no security concerns according to matern@@ al exposure , which was 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bit ) on the maximum human exposure exposure of 30 mg .
based on conventional clinical studies with Ari@@ ep@@ raz@@ ole ( oral ) for safety @-@ har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity in repet@@ itive gift , re@@ productive tox@@ icity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity , and to the can@@ o@@ gens potential had not made no special haz@@ ards for human beings .
tox@@ ic@@ ological significant effects were observed only at doses or ex@@ positions , which considerably exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans ; so they only have limited or no meaning for clinical use .
the effects of the lead @-@ dependent side of dos@@ cope with rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( corresponds to between 3 @-@ 10 mg / kg / day ( i.e. 10 times the middle ste@@ ady steam @-@ state exposition ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose of people ) .
in addition , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis developed as a result of the tac@@ tics of Sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ benzene in the G@@ alle of Mon@@ keys from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( for 1 to 3 times the middle ste@@ ady dose or the 16@@ - to 81 @-@ fold of the recommended maximum dose of people based on mg / m2 ) .

the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ els was studied in a major study that took part in the 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which about three quarters had received previously an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ els ( in sole gift or mon@@ otherapy ) was compared to conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el medic@@ inal ( used in combination with other medicines for the reduction of side effects ) .
in total , 72 ( 31 % ) of the 229 patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane treated patients on the treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 patients , conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el contained drugs .
consider only those patients who have been treated for the first time in metastatic breast cancer , in relation to the efficacy of the disease and survival compared to the deteri@@ oration of the disease and survival .
in contrast , in patients who had previously received other treatments of metastatic breast cancer , regarding these indicators it was more effective than conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el contained in the medicine .
it may also be used in patients to have st@@ oves or before starting the treatment low neut@@ rop@@ hil@@ en@@ ants in the blood .
the Committee for Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) noted that the first treatment was no longer included , more effective than conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el contained pharmac@@ euticals and that it needs to be given in contrast to other P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing drugs to reduce side effects .
January 2008 , the European Commission published in Bios@@ c@@ ience Limited for authorisation for the placing on the market of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ Mon@@ otherapy is inde@@ struc@@ ted for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer patients , where the first @-@ line therapy for metastatic disease is missing and not displayed to a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ contained therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .

• School brochure • Sum@@ mary of the characteristics of the medicine ( expert information ) , lab@@ eling and packer facilities . • With unique visu@@ ally illustration on the application of the product , cooling dry boxes for transport through the patient .
this means that Ab@@ se@@ wer is similar to a biological drug , which is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and the same substance ( also called &quot; reference lab@@ s &quot; ) .
patients with normal blood pressure values could occur in patients with a blood trans@@ fusion that could be possible in connection with a blood trans@@ fusion , and with which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected .
the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be conducted among the supervision of a physician , experience in the treatment of patients with diseases , for which the medicine are indicated .
in patients with kidney problems and for patients who want to leave a self @-@ blo@@ oming , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a v@@ ein .
injection can also be made from the patient or its partner , if they have appropriate instructions for this purpose .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suff@@ iciency or patients who received chemotherapy alone , the hem@@ ic@@ idal bin@@ ds should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per tonne of adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl to children ) .
the iron values of all patients are to control the treatment to ensure that no iron defic@@ iency should be given , and iron supplements should be administered during the entire treatment .
in patients who receive chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems may be an@@ emia caused by a ery@@ th@@ rop@@ oi@@ et@@ in@@ man@@ gel or thereby that the body is not sufficient for the body &apos;s own ery@@ th@@ rop@@ oi@@ et@@ in .
Er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ oi@@ et@@ in is also applied before operations to increase the number of red blood cells and thereby reducing the consequences of a blood loss .
it is produced by a cell that was introduced to a gene ( DNA ) which they have been authorized to formation of ep@@ och@@ et@@ in al@@ fa .
Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared to injection into a v@@ ein within the framework of a main study of 479 patients suffering from kidney problems caused by ren@@ al problems .
at least eight weeks of patients enrolled at least eight weeks , E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o was inj@@ ected into a v@@ ein before they were either re@@ amed or continued E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the major inde@@ b@@ ator for the efficacy was the change in the hem@@ line bin@@ ds between the beginning of the study and the evaluation period in weeks 25 to 29 .
Moreover , the company also laid the results of a study in which the effects of under the skin spec@@ kl@@ ed wast@@ es were investigated by E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o at 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy .
in the study with patients who had suffered from kidney problems caused by ren@@ al problems , the hem@@ mo@@ glo@@ bin@@ ations of patients who were tested on Ab@@ se@@ amed , were maintained in the same size as with those patients who continue to get E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
compared to this , patients who continued to get E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o , an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl in the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common adverse events of Ab@@ se@@ amen is an increase in blood pressure , which occasionally lead to symptoms of a bovine spongiform encephalopath@@ y ( brain problems ) , such as sudden , stub@@ born head@@ ache and confusion .
Ab@@ se@@ amen may not be applied in patients who may be over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against Epo@@ et@@ in al@@ fa or any of the other components .
Ab@@ se@@ amed as injection under the skin is not recommended for the treatment of ren@@ al problems because other studies are necessary to ensure that this is caused allergic reactions .
at the conclusion , the Committee for Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the medicine has been produced according to the regulations of the European Union of conformity , safety and efficacy profile as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company , the Ab@@ se@@ amed , will provide information about the medical professionals in all Member States , including information on the safety of the medicine .

the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / d@@ L ( 6,2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , except for pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients who should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / d@@ L ( 5.9 - 6.8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
candidates can be different from age , gender and overall disease @-@ disease depending on age , gender and total disease load ; therefore , the evaluation of an individual clinical course and disease management is necessary .
a sur@@ ge of the hem@@ mo@@ glo@@ bin@@ s increased by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to the vari@@ ability of patients , individual hem@@ ic@@ idal bin@@ ds can occasionally be observed or under the hem@@ mo@@ glo@@ bin@@ - target concentration .
in view of this hem@@ line vari@@ ability should be tried using a corresponding dose management , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / l ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
if the hem@@ line bin@@ ds to more than 2 g / d@@ L ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month , or if the permanent hem@@ mo@@ glo@@ un@@ value is 12 g / d@@ L ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the ep@@ ic @-@ al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % .
patients should be closely monitored in order to ensure that epoxy b@@ al@@ fa is necessary in the lowest approved dose which is required for control of an@@ emia and an@@ es@@ hi@@ z@@ ome .
the present clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low h@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher demands than patients on which the initial an@@ emia is less difficult ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .

candidates have to be different from age , gender and total disease burden ; therefore , the evaluation of an individual clinical course and disease management is necessary .
in view of this hem@@ line vari@@ ability should be tried using a corresponding dose management , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / l ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
patients should be closely monitored in order to ensure that ep@@ och@@ al@@ fa in the lowest approved dose , which is required for control of secondary @-@ symptoms .
if after 4 treatment weeks of the hem@@ mo@@ glo@@ om rate by at least 1 g / s ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the ret@@ ik@@ o@@ zy@@ g@@ um increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl to the initial value , the dose of 150 mg / kg can be retained times per week or 450 mg / kg once a week .

during the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ er , it can come to a slight increase in blood @-@ dependent increase in blood cells coming back again during further treatment .
if , your doctor may am@@ end regular blood inspec@@ tions to control the number of blood plat@@ el@@ ets during the first 8 weeks of the treatment .
iron defic@@ iency , dis@@ solution of red blood cells ( ha@@ em@@ ol@@ y@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12@@ - or fol@@ s@@ man@@ s@@ man@@ gel should be taken into account and be treated before the beginning of therapy .

if you suffer from Er@@ y@@ thro@@ bl@@ ast@@ open@@ ia , he will break your therapy with Ab@@ se@@ er and define how your an@@ emia is best treated .
therefore Ab@@ se@@ amed has to be given into a v@@ ein ( intraven@@ ously ) , if you are treated by an@@ a@@ emia due to a kidney disease .
a high hem@@ mo@@ glo@@ bin@@ ds reduce the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of death could be increased .
when increased or increasing the calibr@@ ated pot@@ assi@@ um , your doctor may consider any inter@@ ruption of treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed , until the pot@@ assi@@ um values are in the standard range .
if you suffer from chronic ren@@ al weakness and clin@@ ically obvious cor@@ di@@ disease or storage signs suffer by in@@ adequate heart rate , your doctor will ensure that your hem@@ mo@@ glo@@ bin@@ s will not exceed a particular value .
according to the present knowledge , the treatment of blood poverty with chronic kidney @-@ weak@@ nesses ( ren@@ al in@@ suff@@ iciency ) is not accelerated by the treatment of kidney failure ( kidney failure ) , which does not accelerate the development of ren@@ al failure .
a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between epoxy @-@ al@@ fa gift and the desired effect should be taken into consideration for the effectiveness of Ab@@ se@@ amen .
200 of your doctor regularly adjust your values of red blood @-@ colour@@ ings ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) and to adjust your sampling dose according to the risk of a blood @-@ slip formation ( thro@@ mb@@ o event ) as possible .
this risk should be very carefully derived from the treatment with Epo@@ et@@ in al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk for thro@@ mb@@ otic vas@@ cular events , e.g. if you already occurred ob@@ ese vas@@ cular events ( e.g. a deep v@@ ab@@ ro@@ mb@@ osis or pneum@@ em@@ bo@@ lie ) .
if you are cancer patients , you think that Ab@@ se@@ ba can act as a growth factor for blood cells , and under certain circumstances may affect the tum@@ our .
if a larger orthop@@ edi@@ c surgery is im@@ min@@ ent , the treatment of your an@@ emia should be studied and treated accordingly .
if your values of red blood @-@ colour@@ ants ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) are too high , you should not receive dis@@ gu@@ amed because an increased risk for blood circulation after surgery exists .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ists if you are taking other medicines / apply or applied recently , even if it is not liable to pres@@ cription medic@@ inal products .
if you lose Cic@@ los@@ a ( resources for the suppression of the immune system ) during your therapy , your doctor may appropriate certain blood inspec@@ tions to measure the blood levels of Cic@@ los@@ se .
laboratory tests have no interaction between epoxy and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F are funds for the development of the immune system , for example for cancer chemotherapy or HIV ) .
depending on how your blood poverty ( an@@ a@@ emia ) can be adjusted on treatment , the dose may be adjusted approximately every four weeks until your condition is under control .
if your doctor may submit regular blood tests to check and secure the treatment of treatment and make sure that the medicine works properly and your hem@@ mo@@ glo@@ bin@@ ders does not exceed a given value .
as soon as you are set , you will receive regular doses of bott@@ oms between 25 and 50 i.e. / kg twice weekly , spread over two equally large inj@@ ections .
if your doctor may submit regular blood tests to check and secure the treatment of treatment and make sure your hem@@ line value exceeds a given value .
depending on how to give an@@ a@@ emia on treatment , the dose may be adjusted approximately every four weeks until the condition is under control .
to ensure this , ensure that the tick @-@ line value exceeds a given value , the treat@@ able doctor may carry regular blood inspec@@ tions .
if it is necessary to reduce the treatment time before surgery , a dose of 300 mg / kg can be submitted to 10 consecutive days before surgery , on the day of the surgery and another 4 days after surgery .
however , if your doctor keeps this for appropriate , you can also learn how to spl@@ its yourself under the skin .

A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is applied for the treatment of the following diseases : • oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease which prevents the bones ) both in women after men@@ op@@ ause than even in men .
it is applied to patients with a high fra@@ c@@ tive risk ( bone break ) , including in patients who recently suffered a lower traum@@ atic hat@@ ch as well ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get the bone , a disease that changed the normal process of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus passport should be taken at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with hat@@ ch@@ inc@@ ture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) oral or by injection into one muscle .
the administration of Par@@ ac@@ et@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means against inflamm@@ ation ) shortly after the application of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can reduce symptoms , such as fever , muscle pain , gri@@ pp@@ e@@ similar symptoms , joint pain and head@@ ache .
in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a may only be prescribed by physi@@ cians to have experience in the treatment of this disease .
since the substance in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used to assess A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a .
in the first study , almost 8 000 elderly women with oste@@ opor@@ osis was involved , and the number of ver@@ te@@ br@@ al structures and hi@@ ps were examined over a period of three years .
the second trial consisted of 2 127 male and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years , which had recently been examined a hip t@@ inc@@ ture ; the number of fra@@ c@@ tures were examined for a period of up to five years .
at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was compared to 357 patients in two studies and compared with ris@@ k@@ ron@@ at ( other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) for six months .
principal inde@@ b@@ ator for the efficacy was the content of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ ati@@ ds in ser@@ um ( an enzyme that de@@ compos@@ es the bone structure ) in the blood again at least 75 % compared to the starting value .
in the study with older women , the risk of te@@ br@@ ates in patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( without other oste@@ opor@@ osis medicine ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years compared to placebo .
compared to all patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis medicine ) , with those below placebo was reduced by 41 % .
in the study of men and women with hat@@ ch@@ inc@@ ture we had 9 % of patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a Fra@@ ktur ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under placebo ( 139 from 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most side effects of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a occur within the first three days after the infusion and are less frequently .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a may not be applied in patients who may be over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or one of the other ingredients .
as for all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ists , patients at A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a are subject to the risk of ren@@ al difficulties , reactions to the infusion of kidney disease ( ab@@ die of bone tissue ) in a pine .
the manufacturer of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a sc@@ out recon@@ n@@ aissance materials ready to use oste@@ opor@@ osis in treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , as well as similar material for patients who explains the adverse events of the medicine are explained and referred to when they should contact the doctor .
in April 2005 , the European Commission issued a approval for the company Nov@@ art@@ is Europe harm Limited for the placing on the market of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in the entire European Union .

for treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men , an intraven@@ ous infusion of 5 mg of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended once a year .
in patients with a low @-@ traum@@ atic hip t@@ inc@@ ture , the administration of the infusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a two or more weeks after the operative supply of the he@@ dge is recommended ( see section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a should only be prescribed by doctors , experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
after treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a a long run@@ down period in patients was observed ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is very advis@@ able to ensure a sufficient supply of calcium , at least 500 mg of elem@@ ental calcium twice daily , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recent low @-@ traum@@ atic hil@@ ly inc@@ ture an initial dose of 50.000 to 12@@ 5,000 i.e. , or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before the first A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a infusion .
the frequency of symptoms that occur within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , can be reduced by Par@@ ac@@ et@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a .
patients with ren@@ al impair@@ ment ( see section 4.4 ) In patients with an cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine cle@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended that limited clinical experiences to this patient group .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) a dose adjustment is not necessary because the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination with older patients were similar to younger patients .
children and yo@@ ungst@@ ers A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended for the application of children and yo@@ ungst@@ ers under 18 years of age , as data concerning the un@@ think@@ able and effectiveness are missing .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended in patients with heavy kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) not recommended because this patient population is limited to limited clinical experiences .
prior to the beginning of the therapy , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a &apos;s pre @-@ existing Mort@@ ar therapy is treated with a sufficient supply of calcium and vitamin D ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to the fast integration of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid to the bone structure , a temporary hypo@@ cr@@ ate can develop , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the infusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.8 ) .
additionally , it is very advis@@ able to ensure a sufficient supply of calcium , equivalent to at least 500 mg of basic calcium , at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
cancer disease , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ost@@ ero@@ ids , poor oral hygiene , should be performed prior to an application of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ata under an appropriate preventive dental treatment .
for patients who need dental inter@@ ventions , no data are available , whether the inter@@ ruption of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sen in the pine region .
the clinical evaluation by the untreated physician should be based on every patient and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms , which occur within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , can be reduced by Par@@ ac@@ et@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( see section 4.2 ) .
the incidence of serious adverse events reported on patients who received A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a were increased ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients who received placebo ( 0.6 % ) ( 22 of 3.@@ 852 ) .
in the oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , HOR@@ IZ@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ ant Quest@@ ionn@@ al Trial &#91; RF@@ T &#93; ) was the total th@@ reading of atri@@ al numbers between A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occ@@ asi@@ onal ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) un@@ wanted drug inter@@ actions are listed in Table 1 .
kidney @-@ disorder Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid was associated with kidney dysfunction , which resulted in the decrease of ren@@ al function ( i.e. an increase in the ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute kidney failure .
the change of cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine cle@@ ance ( measured before administration ) and the appearance of kidney failure and a restricted ren@@ al function were similar in oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years similar between the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a- and the placebo group .
a temporary increase in the Ser@@ um Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days of gift was observed , at 1.8 % treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treated patients compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with placebo .
based on the evaluation of the lab results , the temporary as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic calcium carbonate ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) were treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in a large clinical study treated patients compared to 21 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in the mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get @-@ studies .
all patients were complem@@ entary with sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study for post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis in the study on avoid@@ ance of clinical fra@@ c@@ tures in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get trials ( see section 4.2 ) .
in the study on avoid@@ ance of clinical fra@@ c@@ tures , the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ in@@ ely measured , however , the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D in the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
local reactions after administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in a large clinical study was reported on local reactions to the infusion of the infusion , such as tube , sw@@ elling and / or pain ( 0.7 % ) .
oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sen in the oral area , mainly in cancer patients , over oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sen ( primarily in the pine zone ) reported that with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid , were treated .
many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ o@@ itis , and the majority of reports rel@@ ates to cancer patients to Zah@@ nex@@ er@@ ections or other dental handles .
7 study involving 7.@@ 7@@ 36 patients showed oste@@ o@@ ek@@ rose in the p@@ ines area with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and placebo in patients treated with placebo .
in case of an over@@ dose that leads to a clin@@ ically important hypo@@ cal@@ ary , can be achieved by the gift of oral calcium and / or an intraven@@ ous infusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate .
clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years ( BM@@ D ) -@@ T Score for diagonal h@@ or ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing sp@@ ine fra@@ cture .
effects on morph@@ ometric media fra@@ c@@ tures A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a sen@@ ed significantly over a period of three years as well as already after one year the incidence of one or more new sp@@ ine fra@@ c@@ tures ( see Table 2 ) .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treated patients aged 75 years and older had compared to placebo patients compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.0@@ 001 ) .
effects on hip fra@@ c@@ tures A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a proved an equal effect on three years , which resulted in a reduced risk reduction by 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) .
effect on the bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a increased the bone density at the lum@@ bar ver@@ ac@@ ic acid , th@@ igh and the dist@@ al radius compared to placebo treatment ( 6 , 12 , 24 , and 36 months ) .
9 % increase in bone density of the lum@@ bar sp@@ ine by 6.7 % , the whole body by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % .
bone hist@@ ology At 152 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients who were treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) , a year after the third annual dose of bon@@ bi@@ op@@ sies were taken from the Beck@@ um sponge .
a micro @-@ computer tom@@ ographic ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treated patients compared to placebo a increase in the bone volume and ob@@ taining the tra@@ be@@ cular bone design .
bon@@ ding mark@@ er The bone @-@ specific phosphate ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ terminal Prop@@ he@@ ti@@ d type @-@ I@@ - col@@ lagen ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in ser@@ um and the beta @-@ C @-@ T@@ elop@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in ser@@ um were determined in perio@@ dically intervals during study time .
treatment with an annual 5 @-@ mg dose of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a reduced by 30 % compared to the initial value and was kept at 28 % below the initial value of 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial income after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the initial for 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the initial value of 36 months .
the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ in@@ ely measured , but the majority of patients received a starting dose of vitamin D ( 50.000 to 12@@ 5,000 i.e. oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular ) 2 weeks before infusion .
the overall mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a group , compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) in the HOR@@ IZ@@ ON @-@ RF@@ T study increased the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treatment compared to placebo treatment the BM@@ D in total and string length on all points .
the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treatment resulted in more than 24 months compared to placebo treatment for an increase of BM@@ D by 5.4 % in total and 4.3 % at the closing price .
clinical efficacy in men in the HOR@@ IZ@@ ON @-@ RF@@ T study were randomised and evaluated in 185 patients the BM@@ D was assessed after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical fra@@ c@@ tures for men ; the incidence of clinical trials was 7.5 % for A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treated men compared to 8.7 % for placebo .
in another study in men ( Study CZ@@ O@@ L@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 23@@ 08 ) , once an annual administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a were included in comparison to the percentage of the lum@@ bar ver@@ te@@ br@@ al BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the initial value .
clinical efficacy of treatment with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was studied in patients and patients at the age of 30 years with radi@@ ologically confirmed Mor@@ get of the bone phosph@@ ates ( medium ser@@ um mirror of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ orus according to the 2,@@ 6@@ fold @-@ 3,@@ 0@@ fold @-@ specific upper value when taking into the study ) .
11 The effectiveness of an infusion of 5 mg Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid compared to the intake of 30 mg of Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at once daily during 2 months was detected in two six months comparative studies .
in the combined results , a similar reduction of pain and pain @-@ imp@@ acted pain was observed in comparison to the initial value for A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at .
patients who were classified as Respon@@ sible Study at the end of the six @-@ month period ( referring to therapy ) could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
of the 143 with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and the 107 with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate patients treated at the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic response of 141 of patients treated with Ris@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , compared to 71 the patients treated with ris@@ k@@ ron@@ ate patients , received a median duration of the follow @-@ up period of 18 months after application .
one @-@ time and multi@@ ples of 5 and 15 minutes of in@@ fu@@ sions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic data that proved dos@@ is@@ o independent .
the plasma tor@@ ch quickly increased from &lt; 10 % of the maximum value to 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long lasting phase very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value .
quick bi@@ ochem@@ ical disappearance of the large cycle with half times t t . ½ h 0.@@ 24 and t ½ β is 1,@@ 87 hours , followed by a long Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ ic age group t ½ g 146 hours .
the early distribution phases ( α and β , with the above 2 ½ -@@ values ) represent a fast res@@ or@@ ption in the bones and the precip@@ itation over the kidneys .
in the first 24 h , 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose is found in urine when the rest is mainly bound to the bone tissue .
the aggregate body cle@@ ance is independent of the dose 5.@@ 04 ± 2,5 l / h and remains unt@@ rue from sex , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the infusion period from 5 to 15 minutes resulted in the decline of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the infusion , but did not have any effect on the surface under the curve ( plasma concentration ) .
a reduced Clear@@ ance by Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 enzymes do not yet metab@@ oli@@ zed because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is not yet metab@@ oli@@ zed because they are a weak or no more direct and / or ir@@ reversible inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 450@@ -

this results in a slight ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50 - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate kidney cleanse down to a cre@@ at@@ ine cle@@ ance to 35 ml / min .
due to heavy kidney disorders ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in@@ - Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only limited data are not possible for this population .
acute tox@@ icity The highest non @-@ sensitive single dose was 10 mg / kg body weight and at rats 0.6 mg / kg body weight .
in dogs of dogs , single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on AU@@ C , 6 times the recommended human therap@@ ist ) , administered over a period of 15 minutes , well and without a ren@@ al influ@@ encing .
sub @-@ chronic and chronic tox@@ icity in studies with intraven@@ ous application was administered as a 15 minute infusion of zinc defic@@ iency when doses of 0.6 mg / kg was administered in 3 @-@ day periods ( a cum@@ ulative dose which corresponds to 7@@ fold the human therap@@ ist , related to AU@@ C , corresponds to the AU@@ C ) .

summary of the EP@@ AR for the public The document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EP@@ AR ) in which discussed the studies carried out by the Committee on Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) to bring recommendations concerning the application of the medicine .
Ac@@ counts is used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ ins@@ ulin dependent diabetes ) , where met@@ form@@ in ( a di@@ abet@@ ic medication ) is not displayed . • It can be used together with another di@@ abet@@ ic medication ( Du@@ al@@ therapy ) .
in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( in particular , overweight patients ) may not be applied with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose .
in combination with a sul@@ fa @-@ resin , or ins@@ ulin at the beginning of the Ac@@ tos treatment , except in patients with hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ ca@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here should the dose of the sulph@@ ur resin or the ins@@ ulin should be reduced .
this means that the body &apos;s own ins@@ ulin can be util@@ ized better and the blood sugar levels sin@@ ks , reducing the type 2 diabetes .
in more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of Ac@@ tos in tri@@ ple@@ th@@ therapy was investigated ; in addition , patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ f@@ yl@@ l@@ ite , in addition , they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3.5 years .
in the studies , the concentration of a substance in blood ( gly@@ cem@@ y@@ li@@ zed hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , which shows how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ counts led to a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which can be concluded that the blood glucose levels were reduced from 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg .
at the end of the Tri@@ ple@@ a study , the effect of an additional application of Ac@@ counts in the existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ fon@@ d@@ yl@@ l@@ ite in a reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values by 0,@@ 94 % , while the addition of placebo contributed to a decrease of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study included in the combination of Ac@@ tos and ins@@ ulin in 289 patients , the patients who additionally contributed to ins@@ ulin , a reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months compared to placebo in addition to placebo .
the most common adverse events related to Ac@@ tos were tend@@ encies , infections of the upper re@@ spir@@ atory infections , weight gain and hypo@@ thes@@ ia ( reduced sensitivity to friction ) .
Ac@@ counts may neither be applied in patients who are possibly super@@ sensitive ( allergic ) compared to Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or one of the other components , even in patients with liver problems , heart failure or di@@ abet@@ ic k@@ eto@@ ac@@ id@@ osis ( high chol@@ ester@@ ol levels - ac@@ idity levels - in blood ) .
it was decided that Ac@@ tos were in line with a mon@@ otherapy ( in sole use ) as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients , where met@@ form@@ in is not displayed .
in October 2000 , the European Commission announced a approval by Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited for placing on the market of Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union .
the tablets are white to white , round , curved and carry on one side the mark &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; AC@@ T@@ OS . &quot;
Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination with ins@@ ulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is in@@ sufficient and in@@ compatibility with those met@@ form@@ in due to contra@@ indications or in@@ compatibility ( see section 4.4 ) .
for the use of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years of age , no data is available , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended .
in patients receiving at least one risk factor ( e.g. previous heart attack or sy@@ mptom@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , a de@@ compens@@ ated heart failure should begin to increase the treatment with the lowest available dose and increase dosage .
patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency , weight gain or est@@ rogen , particularly those with reduced car@@ di@@ al reserve .
patients should be found at signs and symptoms of cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency , weight gain and est@@ ry when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is used in combination with ins@@ ulin .
a cardiovascular study with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre@@ existing advanced mak@@ tionary disease was carried out .
in this study , an increase in reports of heart failure , which however did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with increased output liver enzymes ( AL@@ T &gt; 2,5 x upper limit of standard range ) or with other signs of liver disease may not be used .
if the AL@@ T mirrors up to 3 times the upper limit of the standard range , the liver surface values are as soon as possible .
if one patient developed symptoms that point out on an he@@ p@@ atic dysfunction , such as unexpected nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , upper jaw pain , fatigue , appet@@ ite and / or dar@@ ker har@@ n , are the liver enzymes .
the decision to continue whether the treatment is continued with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one should be derived from the clinical evaluation of the clinical evaluation .
in clinical studies with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , dos@@ sier was detected , which can be stir from fat deposits , and in some cases linked to a fluid flow .
as a result of a hem@@ odi@@ lution with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , a mar@@ gin@@ ally reduction in the middle hem@@ ic@@ idal bin@@ ds ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and the hem@@ at@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) .
similar changes were observed in patients with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ ash@@ bin@@ s by 3.6 @-@ 4.1 % ) and at a lower degree in patients under sul@@ fon@@ yl bin@@ s by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % .
as a result of increased ins@@ ulin @-@ ins@@ iti@@ vity in patients who received Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one as oral two or triple combination therapy with ins@@ ulin @-@ based chemotherapy , the risk of dos@@ is@@ ite hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ ca@@ emia .
after the introduction of the market with Thi@@ ac@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ an , including Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , about an occurr@@ ence or deteri@@ oration of di@@ abet@@ ic mac@@ ular mo@@ dems with a decrease of visual acuity was reported .
it is un@@ clear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and the occurr@@ ence of mac@@ ular mo@@ dems , however , if patient must report on dis@@ ruption of visual acuity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ological pur@@ ification should be considered .
in a summar@@ izing analysis of messages un@@ wanted events from randomised controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one .
the calculated fre@@ t@@ inc@@ ture incidence came to 1.9 fra@@ c@@ tures for 100 patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one treated women and 1,1 fra@@ c@@ tures for women who were treated with a comparative medication .
in the pro@@ active study , a study conducted over 3.5 years for research involving cardiovascular events , stood at 44 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patients ) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication .
patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy , and if a patient does not wish to receive a pregnancy or the entry ( see section 4.6 ) .
studies for investigation of inter@@ actions have shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one did not show relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ et@@ etics or pharmaceutical dynamics of dig@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
inter@@ actions involving medicines that are metab@@ oli@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contra@@ cep@@ hal@@ a , Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Cal@@ ci@@ um@@ can@@ al@@ blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ er are not expected .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zil ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8- inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase of AU@@ C by Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one around the 3 times .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one using Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a decrease of AU@@ C by Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one by 54 % .
this is due to it is due to the treatment with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one who reduces hyper@@ ins@@ ul@@ in@@ emia and increased ins@@ ulin resistance of the parent &apos;s disease and thereby reducing the availability of metab@@ olic sub@@ str@@ ates for the red@@ dish growth .
very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; frequent &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 ; &lt; 1 / 1000 ; rarely &gt; 1 / 10000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , single cases : unknown ( from present data is not estimated ) .
this lead to a temporary variation of the tower and the refra@@ c@@ tive index of the lens , as well as in other hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ ric@@ ous ingredients are observed .
in clinical studies with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , AL@@ T calls over the three times the upper limit of the standardi@@ zation frequently occurred precisely as below placebo , but more rarely than in comparative groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fa drugs .
in an out@@ comes study in patients with pre@@ existing advanced mak@@ tionary disease , the frequency of severe cardi@@ ac failure was 1.6 % higher than placebo when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one bz@@ w .
since its market launch , rarely about cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency has been reported , however , if pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in combination with ins@@ ulin or patients with cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency has been applied .
there was a summar@@ izing analysis of messages un@@ wanted events from randomised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one treated groups and over 7,@@ 400 patients treated with comparative medication groups .
in the study conducted over a period of 3.5 years , questionn@@ aire were treated at 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one treated patients compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication .
when taking the maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , 180 mg / day over seven days have no symptoms .
Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one seems to work on a activation of specific kernel recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ation of Rec@@ ept@@ or @-@ γ ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) ) , which leads to an elevated ins@@ ins@@ ulin @-@ sensitivity of liver , fat and sk@@ el@@ eton muscle cells .
it could be shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one can reduce glucose production in the liver and increases peripheral glucose levels in the event of a ins@@ ulin resistance .
a clinical study with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one versus G@@ lic@@ en@@ zi@@ d as Mon@@ otherapy has continued over two years to investigate the therapeutic efficacy ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 treatment months ) .
at the time after two years after the start of therapy a blood sugar control was determined ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) by Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one at 69 % of treated patients ( compared to 50 % of patients treated below G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study about 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was adjusted with ins@@ ulin @-@ in@@ adequate , to Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or placebo .
in patients with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduced the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c - value of 0.@@ 45 % , compared to the patients who continue to have only ins@@ ulin one in the group treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one group .
in clinical studies over a year , under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one showed a statistically significant decrease of the album um@@ ine / Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ quot@@ i@@ ents compared to initial values .
the effect of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ( Mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was tested in a small , on 18 weeks of the study of type 2 di@@ abet@@ ic patients .
in most clinical trials , compared to placebo a reduction in plasma tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de and the free fatty acids and a rise of HD@@ L@@ - Chol@@ ester@@ in@@ spiegel as well as small but not significantly increased LD@@ L@@ - Chol@@ ester@@ in@@ spiegel .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one compared to Pla@@ z@@ ebo , met@@ form@@ in or G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d the overall pl@@ as@@ mal gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de and the free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L Chol@@ ester@@ in@@ spiegel .
compared to placebo was found no statistically significant increase in LD@@ L Chol@@ ester@@ in@@ spiegel , while met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d were observed .
in a study about 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was not only reduced the so@@ ber @-@ tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de , but also improved tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de mirror , this also increased to both a effect on the Tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de Absor@@ ption and the Tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de Absor@@ ption .
in the pro@@ active study , a cardiovascular study enrolled , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and advanced , advanced , advanced and cardiovascular disease were randomised to either Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years .
after oral application , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is quickly res@@ or@@ ated , with the peak con@@ centric con@@ gest@@ ions to un@@ changeable Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in plasma for 2 hours after application .
based on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV contributed to the efficacy in roughly the three times the efficacy of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minim@@ ally pronoun@@ ced .
in interaction studies , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one could not have found a relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ et@@ etics or pharmaceutical dynamics of dig@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zil ( cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) increases or reduces the plasma concentration of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ( see section 4.5 ) .
according to oral application of radio@@ active pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in humans , the mark@@ er was found mainly in barrel ( 55 % ) and a lower degree in Har@@ n ( 45 % ) .
the mean plasma @-@ Eli@@ min@@ ating fluid period of un@@ changeable Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is 5 @-@ 6 hours , and that of the active metabolism is at 16 - 23 hours .
the plasma concentrations of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and its metabol@@ ites are lower than healthy volunteers with reduced kidney function in patients with reduced kidney function , but similar to the oral cle@@ aring of the matern@@ ity .
in tox@@ ic@@ ological studies in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys , according to repeated administration of plasma volume with hem@@ og@@ ation , an@@ emia and reversible ch@@ ec@@ centric heart hyper@@ t@@ roph@@ ic .
this is due to it , that under treatment with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduces hyper@@ ins@@ ul@@ in@@ emia and increased ins@@ ulin resistance of the parent &apos;s disease and thereby reducing the availability of metab@@ olic sub@@ str@@ ates for f@@ öt@@ al growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) in the gro@@ ve increased disability from hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( male and female rats ) and tum@@ ours ( male rats ) of the ur@@ inary bladder epi@@ thel@@ ium .
in a animal model of the family @-@ like poly@@ pos@@ is ( FA@@ P ) , treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ces resulted in increased frequency of col@@ ont@@ an@@ ors .

the calculated fre@@ t@@ inc@@ ture incidence came to 1.9 fra@@ c@@ tures for 100 patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one treated women and 1,1 fra@@ c@@ tures for women who were treated with a comparative medication .
in the pro@@ active study , a study conducted over 3.5 years for research involving cardiovascular events , stood at 44 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patients ) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication .
in another study , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d were examined .
in clinical trials over 1 year showed a statistically significant decrease of the album um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ quot@@ i@@ ents compared to initial values .
in a study about 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was not only the so@@ ber @-@ tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de , but improved beyond the post@@ p@@ ran@@ ch mirror elevated tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de view , this is both on a effect on the Tr@@ y@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic absorption system as well as to the he@@ p@@ yl@@ ated tr@@ y@@ g@@ inal@@ d synthesis .

Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane was given a total of 294 patients with type 1 diabetes , where the pan@@ cre@@ as is no ins@@ ulin , and type 2 diabetes , where the body is not able to use ins@@ ulin .
after 12 weeks the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cem@@ ented hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , which shows how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c @-@ mirror , which pointed out that the blood sugar levels were similarly lowered considerably to other human @-@ ins@@ ulin .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients to react sensiti@@ vely ( allergic ) to human@@ ins@@ ulin ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components .
in addition , doses of Ac@@ tu@@ ph@@ ane may be adapted , when it is administered along with a number of other medicines that can be eff@@ ected on blood sugar ( the full list is to be dis@@ closed ) .
at the conclusion , the Committee of Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane was in the treatment of diabetes .
October 2002 , the European Commission announced the Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S authorization for placing on the market of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the entire European Union .

in case of switch to Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in patients a dose adjustment is required , it may be necessary for the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after conversion .
some patients suffering from hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ cem@@ ic reactions were reported after a change of animal against human ins@@ ulin , reported that the early warning sympt@@ om of a hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ ca@@ emia were less pronoun@@ ced or unlike its previous ins@@ ulin .
prior to travel , which should go over several time zones , the patient should bring it to the advice of his physician , because such journeys can be used , ins@@ ulin and meals should be applied to other times respectively .
the doctor may therefore consider potential inter@@ actions in therapy and its patients always ask for others taken by them .

this document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EP@@ AR ) in which discussed the studies carried out by the Committee on Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) in order to bring recommendations concerning the application of the medicine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the dent@@ ist activ@@ ist in Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id , ins@@ ulin human ( r@@ DNA ) , is produced with the procedure of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant technology &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id must not be applied in patients who are possibly over against ins@@ ulin human ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components .
in addition , doses of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id may be adapted if it is administered along with a number of other medicines that can be eff@@ ected on blood sugar .
October 2002 , the European Commission announced the Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S authorization for placing on the market of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the entire European Union .
if two types of ins@@ ulin has to be mixed , first the amount of the rapidly @-@ acting ins@@ ulin has to be tested , then the amount of the long @-@ acting ins@@ ulin .
3 If a switch to Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in patients is required , it can be necessary for the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after conversion .
prior to travel , which should go over several time zones , the patient should bring it to the advice of his physician , because such journeys can be used , ins@@ ulin and meals should be applied to other times respectively .
5 - General ill@@ nesses and complaints at the Sub@@ project Gel@@ eg@@ is - Local over@@ sensitive reaction influence during ins@@ ulin therapy can occur local sensitive reaction reactions ( tube , sw@@ elling , ju@@ ck@@ ily , pain and hem@@ at@@ oma on injection point ) .
di@@ abet@@ ics should therefore always have grief , swe@@ ets or sugar fruit juice with a in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) or glucose by glucose or glucose by the doctor .
clinical trial in an intensive care unit for the treatment of hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia ( blood sugar above 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) with 204 di@@ abet@@ ic and 13@@ 44 non @-@ di@@ abet@@ ic patients demonstrated that one with intraven@@ ously given ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id induced norm@@ ality ( blood sugar 4.4 - 6.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) reduced the mortality rate by 42 % ( 8 % vs 4.6 % ) .
the effect starts within half an hour , the active maximum will be reached within 1.5 to 3.5 hours and the overall duration of the activity is approximately 7 to 8 hours .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic profile of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id was investigated on a smaller number ( n = 18 ) di@@ abet@@ ic children ( aged between 6 and 12 years ) and youth ( aged between 13 and 17 ) .
the data is limited , but the acceptance is close to the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic profile with children and adolescents , similar to adults .

if the ur@@ inary acid is still more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter , the dose may be increased to 120 mg once daily .
during the first treatment sessions , treatments may still occur ; therefore , the patient &apos;s disease is recommended at least during the first six months of treatment with Aden@@ ur@@ ic even further medicines for the prevention of tox@@ ic@@ an@@ cies .
the medicine is not recommended in children and in patients who had an organ tran@@ splantation , because it was not investigated for these groups .
in the first study to participate in the 1 0@@ 72 patients , the efficacy of three different Aden@@ ur@@ ic doses ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared to placebo ( pseud@@ o medic@@ ations ) and Al@@ lo@@ purple ( a other medicines for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia ) .
in the second study , two doses of Aden@@ ur@@ ic were compared twice daily for 80 and 120 mg once daily in 7@@ 62 patients each with Al@@ lo@@ yal ol .
in both studies Al@@ lo@@ y@@ in@@ ol was applied during a daily dose of 300 mg . patients with kidney problems were only 100 mg per day .
major inde@@ b@@ ator for efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ inary acid levels in the blood was less than 6 mg / d@@ dl .
in the first study 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) of patients , the Aden@@ ur@@ ic erup@@ ted daily in a dose of 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) of the patients who once daily contain a ur@@ inary level of urea in the blood of 6 mg / d@@ L per day .
in comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 out of 268 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ y@@ in@@ ol and not one of the 134 patients under placebo .
the most common adverse events of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed from 1 to 10 of 100 ) are head@@ ache , di@@ arr@@ he@@ a , nau@@ sea ( Nau@@ sea ) , r@@ ash and abnormal liver values .
in particular , in patients with heart failure in pre@@ history , a increased risk of certain adverse events that affect the heart and blood vessels .
at the conclusion , the Committee for Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) reached that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective during the lowering of the ur@@ inary disease in the blood , but also a higher risk of adverse events might be associated with the heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia in ill@@ nesses which have already led to urine ( including one from the patient &apos;s history or current po@@ ison@@ o , and / or a gi@@ on@@ arthritis ) .
if the ser@@ um resistance can still be taken after 2 @-@ 4 weeks or more &gt; 6 mg / d@@ L ( 357 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , can be considered a dose increase to AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily .
in patients with heavy kidney @-@ functional limitations , the efficacy and safety were not completely examined so far ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in@@ - Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see section 5.2 ) .

clinical study results The efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was shown in two pen@@ iv@@ ot@@ al studies of phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and the act study as described below ) that were performed with 1.8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia and g@@ out .
the primary work end@@ point was in any study of the proportion of patients with which the last three months had a particular ser@@ um @-@ acid levels &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily ( n = 269 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 10 ) for patients with a ser@@ um incre@@ ment value at the beginning of study from &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2,0 mg / d@@ L .
the AP@@ EX study showed a statistically significant su@@ peri@@ ority between treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to conventional cans of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 258 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ act study showed a statistically significant su@@ peri@@ ority relative to 6 mg / s ( 357 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) as well as AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily as well as AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to conventional dosage of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .

the lowering of the ser@@ um @-@ reflective mirror at &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed at the physician attendance in week 2 and kept permanent over the whole treatment .
509 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with ser@@ um at@@ in@@ ine values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub @-@ group of patients with kidney restrictions The AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy in 40 patients with kidney limitation ( d. h .
AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was the primary efficacy threshold of 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of the patient .
there was no clin@@ ically significant differences in regard to the percentage response of the ser@@ um @-@ acid concentrations in subjects , regardless of their kidney function ( 58 % in group with normal kidney function and 55 % in group with severe kidney dysfunction ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub @-@ group of patients with ser@@ um @-@ acid concentrations ≥ 10 mg / d@@ l. approx . 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - und F@@ act study ) had a ser@@ um @-@ acid concentrations of ≥ 10 mg / d@@ L .
the data collected in two years showed that the permanent decrease of ser@@ um levels showed that less than 3 % of patients in the months 16 @-@ 24 resulted in a reduction of tox@@ icity in the months of 16 @-@ 24 ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients and no treatment against gi@@ raff@@ les ) .
this was associated with a reduction in the tox@@ ic@@ idal size , which resulted in 54 % of patients a complete disappearance of the tox@@ ins until month 24 .
increased TS@@ H@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ I@@ U / ml ) were observed in patients who received a long @-@ term treatment with Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients who received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.8 % ) in the open long@@ time extension studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
in healthy volunteers the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ max ) and the area under the plasma concentration period ( AU@@ C ) from Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at after administration easier and multi@@ pler doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ is@@ proportional .
for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg is observed for Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at a rise of AU@@ C , which is greater than the dos@@ is@@ proportional increase .
after taking easier or multi@@ pler doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ max is 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µg / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µg / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant change in the percentage of ser@@ um @-@ acid concentrations was observed , unless this has been tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent ste@@ ady steam @-@ state distribution volume ( V@@ pp / F ) from Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at is in the range from 29 to 75 l after intake of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plasma reference of Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at is approximately 9@@ 9.2 % ( primary binding to Alb@@ um@@ in ) and is about the concentration of concentration that is achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis ( disease in which the bones are incub@@ ated ) for women after men@@ op@@ ause , where a risk for a low vitamin D mirror contains .
the patient must absor@@ b the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vit@@ amine supplement ) .
to avoid irrit@@ ation of the feeding of food , the patient may not drop until after the first food intake of the day , the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
since Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate and vitamin D3 is already separated from one another in pharmac@@ euticals , the company placed data in the European Union , which origin@@ ate from previous studies and published literature .
the company also led a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to prove the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE regarding the increase of vitamin D @-@ mirrors .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels were treated with the patients who had been treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 11 % ) than that of those who only had Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( 32 % ) .
Moreover , the company also submitted data to present that the amount contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is exactly the dose which is needed for preventing a bone loss .
the most common adverse events ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ ache , pain of the mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal pain ( di@@ arr@@ he@@ a ) , di@@ arr@@ he@@ a , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ( di@@ arr@@ he@@ a ) , di@@ arr@@ he@@ a , Dy@@ es ( hat@@ ch ) , ro@@ aring ab@@ dom@@ en ( b@@ lowing ) , ro@@ aring ab@@ dom@@ en ( cr@@ ushing stomach ) as well as aci@@ dic recording .
in patients with spec@@ ulation sensitivity ( allerg@@ y ) against Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at , vitamin D3 or other components must not be applied AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
it may not be applied when patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand upright or sit in for at least 30 minutes .
January 2007 the European Commission announced the company Mer@@ ck Sharp and Doh@@ me Ltd. for placing on the market of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in the entire European Union .
cap@@ sel@@ dom , white up to white tablets , marked with the out@@ line of a bone on one side and &quot; 710 &quot; on the other side .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only with water ( not covered with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or import@@ ing medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vit@@ amine supplementary food ) for the day .
the following hin@@ ts are exactly to be sure to reduce the risk of mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation and associated side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be swal@@ lowed up with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) of the day , as a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ al exists . • The patients are supposed to be taken before the first food intake of the day , the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
B p@@ tic ul@@ cus , active gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal ble@@ eding or surgical procedures in the upper gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal tract except P@@ yl@@ or@@ oplast@@ y , only be given ( see section 4.3 ) .
sop@@ esch@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ ag@@ itis , mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ar@@ zer@@ a and mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sion , rarely followed by mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al Stri@@ c@@ tures , were reported in patients under the intake of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( some were these griev@@ ances and required a hospital order ) .
the doctor should therefore attention to all signs and symptoms that are to be noted on possible mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation such as Dy@@ es of ag@@ ic , pain when swal@@ lowing or retro@@ actively to the medicine or a new or strictly mer@@ cen@@ tives to obtain the medicine ( see section 4.8 ) .
3 The risk of serious adverse events seems to be increased in patients who are not able to absor@@ b the medicines and / or after the occurr@@ ence of symptoms that refer to a mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge irrit@@ ation .
it is very important that all doses to be passed on to the patient and to be understood ( see section 4.2 ) .
during a large clinical studies with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at no increased risk , rarely ( after market introduction ) mag@@ enta and Du@@ o@@ den@@ al@@ ul@@ cer@@ a , among them some seriously con@@ trav@@ ellers and comp@@ lications , were reported ( see section 4.8 ) .

there are no data available to indicate whether the setting of a bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ at@@ therapy in patients who di@@ min@@ ished a sur@@ ge surgical procedure , di@@ min@@ ished the risk of an oste@@ on@@ im@@ rose of the Kiev .
the clinical assessment due to the untreated physician is decisive for the treatment of any patients on the basis of an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the patients must be instructed in the intake of taking a dose AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE the tablet in the next morning after having noticed their rede@@ ems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you should not take two tablets at the same day , but the intake of one tablet per week as originally planned on the first day of the week .
other disorders that affect the mineral metabolism ( like vitamin D defic@@ iency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) , should also be adequate at the beginning of therapy with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at food and drinks ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , Ant@@ azi@@ da and some or@@ tho@@ don@@ ors may deteri@@ or@@ ate the res@@ or@@ ption of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at , when they are at the same time .
therefore , patients have to wait at least 30 minutes after taking the Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interaction studies were not carried out , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was taken together with a variety of usually prescribed drugs , without having clin@@ ically relevant relevant inter@@ actions .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended only for the application of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not used during pregnancy or use the feeding women .
animal studies with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at leave no indication to recognize directly damage effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic or post@@ nat@@ al development .
oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose of the Kiev was reported among patients under Bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most reports come from cancer patients but was also reported in oste@@ opor@@ osis agents .
nevertheless , the ser@@ um cal@@ ci@@ um increased up to &lt; 8.0 mg / d@@ L ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the ser@@ um phosph@@ orus up to ≤ 2,0 mg / d@@ L ( 0,@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) in both treatment groups with similar frequency .

the bio@@ availability was calculated accordingly to approximately 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % when Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was taken or half an hour before a standardized breakfast .
in oste@@ opor@@ osis networks , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was effective when it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day .
in healthy volunteers the gift of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times daily ) resulted in any clin@@ ically significant alter@@ ation of the oral bio@@ availability of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( increase in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) .

Adv@@ ag@@ us is administered to adult patients to prevent a kidney or liver tran@@ spl@@ ant in order to prevent off@@ setting of the tran@@ spl@@ ant organ by the immune system .
since T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us and pro@@ gra@@ ft / pro@@ gra@@ ft have already been deployed in the EU , the company presented the results of previously carried out studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft and published data from the published literature .
in addition , the results of a clinical study was presented to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney tran@@ splantation , whereby the application of Adv@@ agra@@ f with Pro@@ gra@@ ft / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or Cic@@ los@@ se was compared .
the major indicator of the efficacy was the number of patients with which the tran@@ spl@@ ant after a treatment duration of one year ( by example ) sought how often a new organ tran@@ spl@@ ant or a res@@ umption of di@@ aly@@ sis was needed ) .
in addition , further studies on 119 patients with kidney tran@@ splantation and 129 patients with liver tran@@ spl@@ ant were performed and examined how adv@@ ancement is recorded in comparison to pro@@ gra@@ f / pro@@ gra@@ ft of the body .
tre@@ ach ( trembling ) , head@@ ache , nau@@ sea / vom@@ iting , di@@ arr@@ he@@ a ( di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ) , kidney problems , increased blood glucose levels ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) and ins@@ om@@ nia ( In@@ som@@ nie ) .
in patients with some sensitivity ( allerg@@ y ) against t@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , macro @-@ anti@@ biotics ( such as Er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in ) or one of the other components must not be applied .
patients and physi@@ cians must be careful if others ( especially some vegetable ) drugs are taken at the same time with Adv@@ agra@@ f &apos;s dose or the dose of the drug may be adapted accordingly to the same time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; hard capsules , ret@@ ardi@@ zed yellow @-@ orange gels , printed in red ink on the light yellow capsule with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 0.5 mg &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the orange capsule head with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 64@@ 47 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and contain white powder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only doctors who are familiar with the immune disease therapy and the treatment of tran@@ spl@@ ant patients , this medicine should be identified or changes in immun@@ oh@@ res@@ sive therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences from the system@@ ic exposition of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , this can lead to tran@@ spl@@ ants or to an increased incidence of side effects , including sub or immun@@ ode@@ gra@@ ft .
patients should always retain the same t@@ acro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; provisions of formulation or regime should only be performed under the di@@ cular control of a doctor &apos;s tran@@ splantation ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
as a result of a changeover to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic pharmaceutical monitoring and appropriate dose regul@@ ates must be achieved to ensure that the system@@ ic exposure of t@@ acro@@ lim@@ us remains .
the dose of Adv@@ agra@@ m should be primarily based on clinical assessment of dis@@ sol@@ ving and toler@@ ability in detail and on blood @-@ reflective regulations ( see below &quot; Recommend@@ ations
after conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f on Adv@@ agra@@ m , the t@@ acro@@ lim@@ us valley should be controlled before the switch and over two weeks after conversion .
on day 4 , the system@@ ic exposition was measured as a valley level , with both formulation both in kidney tran@@ spl@@ itters .
careful and repeated checks of the t@@ acro@@ lim@@ us Tal@@ ents are recommended during the first two weeks after tran@@ splantation under Adv@@ agra@@ m to ensure appropriate substance exposition in the immediate tran@@ spl@@ ant period .
since T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with lower cle@@ ance , can take an adaptation of the Adv@@ agra@@ m @-@ Dos@@ is@@ schem@@ as for several days until the Ste@@ ady State is reached .
in the condition of patients in the first postoperative intake of medicines , the t@@ acro@@ lim@@ us treatment can be administered intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate on the production of an infusion solution ) with a dose of approx .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; duration of the application to the oppression of the tran@@ spl@@ ant control must be maintained ; therefore , a maximum period of oral therapy can therefore be specified . &quot; &quot; &quot;
dose recommendations - kidney tran@@ splantation proph@@ yla@@ xis of tran@@ spl@@ ant and tran@@ spl@@ ant therapy should begin at 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as a daily gift on the morning .
further dose custom@@ ization may be necessary , since the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etics of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us can change during stabil@@ ization of patients after tran@@ splantation .
dose recommendations - liver tran@@ spl@@ ant proph@@ yla@@ xis of the tran@@ spl@@ ant hal@@ ation of the oral Adv@@ ance therapy should begin at 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as a daily gift on the morning .
dosage recommendation - changeover from Pro@@ gra@@ f on Adv@@ agra@@ m must be converted into a daily dose of pro@@ vision@@ ally on a once daily intake of Adv@@ agra@@ m , this change in relation to the entire daily dose is to be carried out .
kidney and liver tran@@ spl@@ ant Up to C@@ agra@@ m once daily must begin to begin the treatment with the recommended initial initi@@ als for proph@@ yla@@ xis for proph@@ yla@@ xis for the proph@@ yla@@ xis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heart tran@@ splantation After adult patients who are changed on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a oral initial dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day is taken once daily in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other tran@@ spl@@ ant receivers Ob@@ jects do not exist any clinical experience with Adv@@ agra@@ f in lun@@ ar , pan@@ cre@@ as and tran@@ splan@@ ted patients in an oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and intest@@ inal tran@@ spl@@ ants in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dose custom@@ ization in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function For maintaining ble@@ aching in the target range can be necessary in patients with severe liver function , a reduction of dose necessary .
patients with reduced kidney function Da kidney function has no influence on pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etics of t@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , it can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not required .
due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potenti@@ als by T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , however , a careful monitoring of ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of ser@@ um incre@@ in@@ ine mirror , an calculation of cre@@ at@@ in@@ in@@ ine and a monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended .
conversion of Cic@@ los@@ se on Adv@@ agra@@ f In the conversion of a Cic@@ los@@ se - to a t@@ acro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy is careful ( see sections 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations to the valley level in full blood The dose should be based on the clinical assessment of rep@@ ulsion and toler@@ ability in single failure of whole blood @-@ t@@ acro@@ lim@@ us @-@ tal@@ es @-@ inspec@@ tions .
it is recommended frequent inspec@@ tions of the t@@ acro@@ lim@@ us talents during the first two weeks after tran@@ splantation , followed by periodi@@ c inspec@@ tions during maintenance therapy .
blood valley @-@ mirror of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us should also be used after conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f on Adv@@ agra@@ m , Dos@@ is@@ adaptation , changes to immun@@ ity treatment or in the same application of substances that could change the t@@ acro@@ lim@@ us full blood concentration ( see section 4.5 ) .
since C@@ agra@@ f is a medicine with a low cle@@ ance , the dose may need several days until the Ste@@ ady State has occurred .
the data in clinical trials agreed that a successful treatment is possible in most cases when the valley level do not exceed 20 n@@ g / ml .
in clinical practice the valley mirror of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us lie in full blood in the first time after liver tran@@ spl@@ ants usually in the range from 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and with kidneys - and heart@@ beat patients at 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml .
during the subsequent maintenance of liver , kidney or cardi@@ ac tran@@ spl@@ ants were used normally in blood concentrations in the range from 5 to 15 n@@ g / ml .
this resulted in serious adverse events , including tran@@ spl@@ ants or other side effects , which can occur in the result of t@@ acro@@ lim@@ us sub or exposure .
patients should always retain the same t@@ acro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; provisions of formulation or regime should only be carried out under the di@@ cular control of a doctor &apos;s tran@@ splantation ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
5 In the treatment of adult patients with tran@@ spl@@ ant tran@@ spl@@ ant that proved to be treated with other immun@@ oh@@ res@@ s@@ ants , there are still no clinical data for ret@@ ardi@@ zed formulation of the C@@ agra@@ f .
for proph@@ yla@@ xis of tran@@ spl@@ ant tran@@ spl@@ ant in adult heart tran@@ spl@@ ant and tran@@ spl@@ ant tran@@ spl@@ ants are still no clinical data for the ret@@ ardi@@ zed formulation of the C@@ agra@@ f .
because of possible inter@@ actions , which can lead to a reduction of the t@@ acro@@ lim@@ mer level in blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of t@@ acro@@ lim@@ us ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ ation ) included , or other plant healing during a treatment with Adv@@ agra@@ f ( see section 4.5 ) .
in patients with di@@ ar@@ rh@@ ö is a particularly careful monitoring of the t@@ acro@@ lim@@ us@@ - concentration in the blood because the acro@@ lim@@ us blood levels may be subject to adverse variations under such circumstances .
in rare cases , aqu@@ at@@ f was considered as a cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opath@@ y called chamber or sept@@ um hyper@@ t@@ rophy , which can therefore also occur under Adv@@ agra@@ f .
further factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders , are one of existing heart diseases , a treatment with cor@@ ost@@ ero@@ ids , hyper@@ tension , kidney or liver function , infections , liquid @-@ loading and oil .
as with other immun@@ ity stress , the impact of sunlight or UV light should be restricted because of the possible risk of mal@@ ign@@ ant skin changes due to appropriate clothing or use of a solar protection with a high protective factor .
if patients who use the t@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , symptoms of pre@@ aches , changing consciousness , powers , powers and tend@@ encies , should be a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g ) .
since C@@ agra@@ f hard capsules , ret@@ ardi@@ zed , L@@ act@@ ose is included in patients with the rare her@@ edit@@ ary g@@ act@@ ose defic@@ iency , l@@ act@@ ose defic@@ iency , or glucose @-@ g@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption particular attention .
the simultaneous use of medicines or plant remedi@@ es that are known as Hem@@ mer or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can reduce the metabolism of t@@ acro@@ lim@@ us or decrease the blood values of t@@ acro@@ lim@@ us or decrease .
therefore it is advis@@ able to change the t@@ acro@@ lim@@ us@@ - blood levels in simultaneous use of substances that can change the CY@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and to set the acro@@ lim@@ us dose for maintaining the same concentrations ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a highly distinctive interaction was achieved with an@@ tim@@ yk@@ ot@@ ika like k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , icon@@ az@@ ole , icon@@ az@@ ole and pre@@ icon@@ az@@ ole , and with the Macro@@ lid anti@@ bi@@ otic ery@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in and HIV @-@ prot@@ ease . ( z .
pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ et@@ ik@@ studies showed that the increase of blood levels mainly from the increased bio@@ availability of t@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , due to the in@@ hibition of the gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal failure , results .
high @-@ dose pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as it is used in acute infections , the concentration of t@@ acro@@ lim@@ us can increase or lower .
t@@ acro@@ lim@@ us is known to the metabolism of other medicines T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us as CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or ; therefore , the simultaneous application of t@@ acro@@ lim@@ us is metab@@ oli@@ zed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 whose metabolism may affect the metabolism .
since T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us reduce the cle@@ ance of ster@@ oid contra@@ diction and thus increase hor@@ mone levels , is especially careful with decisions concerning initial measures .
the results of animal experiments have shown that t@@ acro@@ lim@@ us reduce the cle@@ ance of pent@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital and phen@@ az@@ one , and extend their half @-@ time .
the results of a low number of investigations into tran@@ spl@@ ant patients provide no evidence that under T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , an increased risk of undes@@ irable events in regard to the course and the result of pregnancy is made .
in uter@@ o exposure , a monitoring of new@@ born on any harmful effects of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us ( in particular with its effect on the kidneys ) .

cases of BK @-@ Virus @-@ associated N@@ eph@@ rop@@ ath@@ y and J@@ C virus associated progressive multi@@ focal leu@@ ko@@ y ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients under immun@@ ity therapy , including therapy with Adv@@ agra@@ f .
it was reported about ben@@ ign or mal@@ ign@@ ant Ne@@ op@@ las@@ ms including EB@@ V@@ - associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tum@@ ors in conjunction with the t@@ acro@@ lim@@ us treatment .
due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ ub@@ ility and the high binding to Er@@ y@@ thro@@ zyten and Plas@@ map@@ rot@@ eine can be assumed that t@@ acro@@ lim@@ us is not di@@ aly@@ tic .
effects of action and the codi@@ fied effects on the molecular level , the effects of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us are medi@@ ated through his li@@ aison to a cy@@ tos@@ ol@@ ian protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) which is responsible for enrich@@ ment the connection in cell internal cell .
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ ally independent inhibit@@ or of signal trans@@ duc@@ ts due to the T @-@ cell and prevents the tran@@ scription of a particular number of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ kin genes .

L@@ ung@@ oli@@ zation In a intermediate analysis conducted over a recently realised multi @-@ centre study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f has been reported on 110 patients as part of a 1 : 1 Rand@@ om@@ ization either to acro@@ lim@@ us or Cic@@ los@@ se .
in the first year after tran@@ splantation , chronic tran@@ spl@@ ant is obl@@ iter@@ ated - was less common in the first year after tran@@ splantation ( 2,@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) .
the survival rate after a year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the t@@ acro@@ lim@@ us@@ - and 83 % in Cic@@ los@@ a Group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; abstract 22 ) .
in the patients treated with T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us patients , in 2@@ 1.7 % of cases of creating a bron@@ chi@@ ol@@ itis obl@@ iter@@ ated compared to 3@@ 8.0 % of Cic@@ los@@ a ( p = 0,0@@ 25 ) .
the number of cases where Cic@@ los@@ a had to be converted to t@@ acro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 13 ) , was significantly larger ( p = 0,@@ 02 ) as the number of patients who were dropped from t@@ acro@@ lim@@ us to Cic@@ los@@ se ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 580 ) .

in one study the incidence of the emergence of a Bron@@ chi@@ ol@@ itis was obl@@ iter@@ ated with t@@ acro@@ lim@@ us treated patients significantly .
pan@@ cre@@ as a multi@@ center study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f was conducted at 205 patients who underwent a pan@@ cre@@ as and kidney tran@@ splantation , which received from a random@@ ized procedure to t@@ acro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 103 ) or Cic@@ los@@ a ( n = 102 ) .
the oral initial dose ( per protocol ) of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then reaching the target levels of 8 to 15 n@@ g / ml in 5 .
intest@@ inal tran@@ spl@@ ant The published clinical results of a mono@@ therap@@ eutical in clinical tran@@ spl@@ ants showed in 155 patients ( 65 only intest@@ ine , 75 liver and intest@@ inal and 25 multi @-@ vis@@ cer@@ al tran@@ spl@@ ants showed a rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years .
methods for early recognition of Ep@@ stein @-@ Bar@@ r ( EB@@ V ) and C@@ MV @-@ infections , bone mar@@ g@@ gle , additional gift of inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 @-@ ant@@ agon@@ ists lead to steps between 10 and 15 n@@ g / ml and the latest tran@@ spl@@ ant radiation ( Abu @-@ El@@ m@@ d et al . , Ann Sur@@ g 2001 ; 234 : 404 ) .
factors such as low ha@@ em@@ atic loss and low protein concentrations , which lead to an increase in the un@@ interrupted group of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , or , through treatment with cor@@ ost@@ ero@@ ids , the metabolism of the metabolism should be responsible for tran@@ splantation of higher cle@@ ver@@ aging .
this suggests that the acro@@ lim@@ us is almost completely metab@@ oli@@ zed in front of the outlet , with the exception mainly via the g@@ all .

Adv@@ ate is used for the treatment and prevention of blood disorders in patients with hem@@ oph@@ ilia A ( one by the lack of factor VIII , con@@ gen@@ ital blood disorders ) .
the dosage and frequency of the application are then applied , whether it is applied for the treatment of ble@@ eding or the prevention of blood cells in surgical procedures .
patients with hem@@ oph@@ ilia A suffer from a factor of VIII defic@@ iency , resulting in blood disorders such as ble@@ eding in joints , muscles or inner organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma but referred to a method that is called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology . &quot;
it is produced by a cell that was put into a gene ( DNA ) which was authorized to formation of the human cl@@ utch factor VIII .
Adv@@ ate is similar to another in the European Union of Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ates , similar to that the medicine contains no proteins of human or animal origin .
in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate hem@@ oph@@ ilia A , among them a study involving 53 children under six years , the application of the drug was investigated for prevention of ble@@ eding and surgical procedures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the main study the efficacy of adv@@ ances in preventive medicine was rated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; excellent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at 86 % of 510 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most common adverse events of Adv@@ ate ( ob@@ serves at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are Schwin@@ n , head@@ ache , py@@ rex@@ ie ( fever ) and the formation of anti@@ bodies compared to factor VIII .
Adv@@ ate should not be applied in patients who are possibly super@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against the human cl@@ ash factor VIII , mouse or Ham@@ ster@@ protein or one of the other components .
March 2004 , the European Commission announced a approval for the company B@@ ax@@ ter AG for placing on the market of adv@@ ances in the entire European Union .
dosage of dosage and duration of sub@@ stit@@ uting therapy according to the sever@@ ity of factor VIII defect , after the place and the extent of blood disorders and the clinical state of the patient .
in the following hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic events , by factor VIII activity in the corresponding period do not fall under the given plasma welding ( in % of the standard or in i.e. / dl ) .
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer repeat until the pain and acute impair@@ ment are removed .
injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat until the risk of the patient is over .
during the treatment course , a reasonable dose and frequency of inj@@ ections were committed to determine the factor VIII plasma tor@@ ial .
individual patients can distinguish themselves in their reaction to factor VIII , varying in vi@@ vo recovery and have different half @-@ periods .
3 proph@@ yla@@ xis for long @-@ term proph@@ yla@@ xis in patients with severe hem@@ oph@@ ilia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 i.e. by factor VIII per kg of body weight within 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VIII plasma activities are not achieved or if the blood circulation should not be ruled by a reasonable dose , this test must be carried out to prove an inhibit@@ or .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors , it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic inter@@ actions are to be performed .
the application rate is based on the approval of the patient , whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutral anti@@ bodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a well @-@ known comp@@ lication in the treatment of patients with hem@@ oph@@ ilia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always against the pro@@ ko@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VIII of Ig@@ G Im@@ m@@ ung@@ lob@@ ul@@ ine , which are qu@@ anti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml of plasma with modified Beth@@ es@@ da Ass@@ ay .
the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors , cor@@ related with the extent of the exposure to the factor VIII , with the risk of dependent on the largest and other factors within the first 20 ex@@ positions .
in treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 working days and an@@ am@@ ne@@ ably @-@ known inhibit@@ or development , after conversion from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII product was observed in another , rest@@ art of ( low @-@ hungry ) inhibit@@ ors .
due to the rare occurr@@ ence of hem@@ oph@@ ilia A in women lie between the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and n@@ urs@@ ing .
one of the greatest number of patients was inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) who were all previously untreated patients receiving a higher risk for the formation of inhibit@@ ors , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) .
very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1.000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 100,000 ) , very rare ( frequency on the basis of available data is not estimated ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated according to the sum of the individual patients ( 234 ) . the unexpected drop of blood co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VIII @-@ Refle@@ ction stood post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 post@@ oper@@ atively day ) in a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ ATE infusion .
the blood cl@@ ung was maintained during the entire period and the factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - mirror of plasma and the cle@@ ance rate showed sufficient values on the 15th postoperative day .
in clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ ATE to 145 children and adults 2 with diagnostic he@@ avier to moderate hem@@ oph@@ ilia A ( ≥ 150 days ) just showed a patient after 26 exposure days with A@@ DV@@ ATE ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in the modified Beth@@ es@@ da approach ) .
in addition , no one of the 53 pe@@ diat@@ ric patients with an age of 6 years and diagnostic he@@ avier to moderate hem@@ oph@@ ilia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) was diagnosed after previous exposure to factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) a F@@ VIII inhibit@@ or .
previously untreated patients with 5 of 25 ( 20 % ) patients treated with A@@ DV@@ ATE treated patients inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII .
the immune response of the patient &apos;s traces of cont@@ am@@ inated protein was analyzed by the investigation of the antibody tit@@ res against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects .
one patient showed a statistically significant upward trend as well as a persistent peak of anti @-@ Ch@@ o cell protein , otherwise there were no signs or symptoms related to an allergic reaction or a sensitivity .

based on the approval of available data , the CH@@ MP has still rated the benefits risk , but in fact that the safety profile has to be closely monitored for the following reasons :
thus , the CH@@ MP based on the basis of the safety filter by A@@ DV@@ ATE , which makes a submission of P@@ SU@@ R@@ s every 6 months , decided that the approval is to apply for 5 years another extension procedure .
December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Molecular Limited announced the Committee for Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) officially declared that the company receives its application for approval for placing C@@ ex@@ in to the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
normally , the breast , the brain , the bones or the soft parts ( t@@ issues , the other structures in the body bin@@ ds , en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed and rests ) .
this is a kind of virus , the genet@@ ically modified it was changed so that a gene can bear in the body cells of the body .
the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; Aden@@ ov@@ irus &quot; which has been changed so it does not produce any copies of itself and thus cannot trigger any infections in humans .
Adv@@ om@@ in would have to be inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ours and thus enabling the cancer cells to form normal p@@ 53 @-@ protein .
the p@@ 53 @-@ protein that is made out of the non @-@ def@@ ec@@ tives in the human body existing p@@ 53 gene , contributes to the recovery of corrupt DNA and kill the cells when the DNA can not be restored .
at Li @-@ Frau@@ enk@@ i @-@ Cancer , the p@@ 53 @-@ protein is not correct , the p@@ 53 @-@ protein is not correct , and the cancer cells can grow .
the company placed data from a study with a patient , at the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Krebs in the field of construction , in the bones and in the brain .
after the CH@@ MP has examined the answers to the company &apos;s questions , still some issues were un@@ explained .
based on the review of the initially submitted documents , the CH@@ MP has a list of questions which will be sent to the company .
according to the opinion of the CH@@ MP , it was not sufficient that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i tum@@ ours benefits for the patient .
the Committee also had further concerns relating to the processing of the medicine in the body , the type of administration as well as the safety of the medicine .
in addition , the company had not been proven that Adv@@ ant@@ ages can be manufactured in a reliable way that neither to the environment nor for people who come in contact with the patient , is harmful .
the company won &apos;t be aware of it , whether the withdrawal will have consequences for patients who are currently taking part in clinical trials or &quot; Comp@@ assi@@ on@@ ate Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; modified effic@@ ien@@ ization &quot; means that the tablets are composed so that one of the effective components have been released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat the symptoms of seasonal allerg@@ y rhin@@ itis ( h@@ ay fever , through an allerg@@ y against pol@@ len path@@ way inflamm@@ ation of the nas@@ al paths ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ al sw@@ elling ( stop@@ over nose ) .
for adults and adolescents 12 years old , the recommended dose of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice a tablet that should be taken with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of treatment should be as short as possible and end as soon as the symptoms , especially the sw@@ elling of nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( ro@@ ast nose ) are cl@@ ashed .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be found on the nose .
the most effective measures were the changes in the sever@@ ity of the h@@ ay fever squ@@ at@@ oms that were reported from the patient before the treatment and during 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , patients showed their symptoms every 12 hours in a di@@ ary and evaluated them with a standard scale , how heavy the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
in consideration of all the root sy@@ mptom@@ s@@ men , the patients reported the aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze had taken over a decrease of symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % , compared to 3@@ 5.9 % with the patients who died p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine alone .
when only the sw@@ elling of nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was regarded , the patients showed in aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze a reduction of symptoms by 3@@ 7.4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % with the patient , the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine alone .
the most common side effects of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are speed@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( thro@@ ats ) , oral mal@@ od@@ ness , oscill@@ ation , head@@ ache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ atic ( ins@@ om@@ nia ) , man@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( ins@@ om@@ nia ) , ins@@ om@@ nia ( s@@ me@@ aring ) , ins@@ om@@ nia and nerv@@ ousness .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be allergic to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine or one of the other components , against ad@@ ver@@ ge agents or Lor@@ at@@ adin ( a different medicines for allergi@@ es ) , not used .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze cannot be applied to patients who suffer from an Eng@@ age @-@ angle glaucoma ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ osis ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ osis ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ re@@ osis ( hyper@@ tension ) or already had an hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke ( caused by a brain injury ) or had a risk for a hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic impact .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission announced a approval for the market placing on the market of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze to the European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , however , if swal@@ low ( i.e. without it to cr@@ ush , break or chew@@ ed ) .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used in children under 12 years due to the lack of data concerning the failure and effectiveness ( see section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application is so short as possible , and should not be continued after symptoms of symptoms .
it is recommended to limit the application duration to 10 days , as long as long @-@ term application the activity of p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine can take off .
following the decline of sw@@ elling mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es in the upper re@@ spir@@ atory cause , treatment with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine can be continued as Mon@@ otherapy .
since Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze P@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine contains the medicine also indicated in patients who are treated with a mono@@ amin@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or and within 2 weeks after completion of such therapy .
this is due to the alph@@ am@@ im@@ etric activity with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ pped in combination with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ amine or other dec@@ on@@ gest@@ iv@@ a , erg@@ ot@@ id , erg@@ ot@@ id , erg@@ ot@@ id , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ in , ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine , ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine , oxi@@ di@@ olin , etc . ) .
the safety and effectiveness of these combination therapy were not tested and the data are not sufficient to express appropriate recommendations to the dosage .
the safety and effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver function and not sufficient data to express appropriate recommendations for dosage .
patients must be informed that treatment in case of hyper@@ tension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ esses , heart rhyth@@ mi@@ as , nau@@ sea or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or an ampli@@ fication of head@@ ache ) must be canc@@ eled .
in the treatment of the following patient groups , patients suffering from patients with heart rhyth@@ mi@@ as patients with hyper@@ tension • patients with hyper@@ tension • patients with a m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction in an@@ am@@ n@@ ay , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder or bronze ) in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ess .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is to be used at least 48 hours before performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests as anti @-@ hist@@ amine other reactions to indicators to prevent skin reactions or can reduce their degree .
in addition , clinical trials with disin@@ lor@@ at@@ ine , in which Er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally given , however , no clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions or alter@@ ations of the plasma concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine were observed .
the results of the psychological testing was no significant differences between the patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine and those treated with placebo patients , regardless of whether Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine alone or with alcohol was taken .
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is not yet identified , so the inter@@ actions involving other medicines can not be excluded .
des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in@@ hib@@ its in @-@ vi@@ vo CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 is not in@@ hib@@ ited and neither a sub@@ strate is nor a inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ one .
the in@@ justice of the use of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not secured , experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ an@@ cies , however , no increase the frequency of ab@@ normal@@ ities compared with the frequency in the normal population .
since re@@ productive studies on animals did not always be transferred to humans and to the reason of vas@@ o@@ con@@ tra @-@ sec@@ tional properties of p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine should not be applied in the pregnancy .
however , patients should be clari@@ fied in very rare cases that can be found in very rare cases that can lead to impair@@ ment or ability to serve machines .
symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , Ap@@ no@@ e , di@@ min@@ ished mental attention , cy@@ an@@ osis , Kom@@ a , heart @-@ cycle collapse ) and a CN@@ S @-@ stimulation ( ins@@ om@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ ason , conv@@ ection ) with possible tablets .

a Z@@ NS stimulation is especially likely to do with children , as well as at@@ rop@@ ine @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth dry , po@@ up@@ ill@@ en@@ rigid and di@@ lat@@ ation , hood , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal symptoms ) .
these include both the inhibit@@ ing of pro@@ inflamm@@ atory cy@@ to@@ kin@@ en such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 8 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 as well as the inhibit@@ or of the expression of the inhibit@@ ing class P @-@ sel@@ ess on end@@ oth@@ el@@ ial cells .
in a single dose trial with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement variables of the flight power , including the ampli@@ fication of sub@@ jective and tasks that are connected to the flies .
in controlled clinical studies , the recommended dose of 5 m@@ g. a day has no increased incidence of dro@@ w@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo .
the orange application of p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine in the recommended dosage may cause additional sympath@@ etic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ st or manifest@@ ations of a Z@@ NS replacement .
1,@@ 248 patients ranged from 12 to 78 years with seasonal allerg@@ itis in rhin@@ itis , with 414 patients suffering from Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets .
in both studies , hist@@ amine @-@ ant@@ agon@@ istic effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets , determined by the overall grade of symptoms ( except for nas@@ al mu@@ c@@ tiv@@ al sw@@ elling ) , significantly higher than under a mono@@ therap@@ y@@ he@@ dr@@ in over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze pills with regard to the sw@@ elling effect , determined by the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ al sw@@ elling , was significantly higher than under a mono@@ therap@@ ist with disin@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine about the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of sex , age or ethnic origin .
as part of a single dose study for pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etics of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine is det@@ ec@@ table within 30 minutes after administration in plasma .

for children ages 6 to 11 , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup respectively .
A@@ eri@@ us was investigated in a total of eight studies involving approximately 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhin@@ itis ( including four trials with seasonal allerg@@ y rhin@@ itis and two trials in patients who also had as@@ thma ) .
the effectiveness was measured by changing the symptoms ( it@@ chy , number and size of quad@@ r@@ ushing , impair@@ ment of sleep and performance on the day ) before and after six weeks of treatment was determined .
for further studies were presented to reflect the body of Sir@@ up , the solution to take and use the hot tab@@ let@@ ten in the same way as the tablets and the application in children un@@ think@@ able .
when allergic rhin@@ itis in rhin@@ itis , when the results of all studies were taken together , the average decrease of symptoms of symptoms ( symptoms of symptoms ) decreased by 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients who received a placebo .
in the two studies in Ur@@ ti@@ aria the decrease of symptoms , after six @-@ week treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared with 40 and 33 % compared to placebo patients .
A@@ eri@@ us should not be applied in patients who may have over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , Lor@@ at@@ adin or one of the other ingredients .
in January 2001 , the European Commission announced a approval for the marketing of A@@ eri@@ us on the market of the European Union .
one tablet once daily , with one or without a meal , to prevent symptoms of allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ) and Ur@@ ti@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there are limited experience from clinical trials to efficacy in the application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine for young people from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
treatment of inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis ( occurr@@ ence of symptoms of less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks ) should be terminated accordingly to the symptoms of symptoms and can be resumed after the sever@@ ance of symptoms .
a persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ( symptoms of 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks ) can be recommended for patients during allerg@@ y days .
clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions were not found in clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin tablets , where Er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally given ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , ag@@ eri@@ us and alcohol was not strengthened by alcohol ( see below section 5.1 ) .
however , patients should be clari@@ fied in very rare cases that can be found in very rare cases that can lead to impair@@ ment or ability to serve machines .
in clinical trials in various indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ ti@@ car@@ ia , 3 % more adverse events in patients with A@@ eri@@ us were reported when patients treated with placebo .
the most common adverse events that was reported to be more common than placebo was fatigue ( 1,2 % ) , mouth dry ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ ache ( 0.6 % ) .
in a clinical study involving 5@@ 78 adol@@ escent patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common adverse events were treated with 5.9 % of the patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and 6.9 % of patients who were treated with placebo .
in a multi@@ multi@@ dose study , with up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine ( Ne@@ ver@@ nal clinical dose ) were given , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
this includes both the in@@ sist@@ ence of pro@@ inflamm@@ atory cy@@ to@@ kin@@ en such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 8 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 as well as the inhibit@@ or of the expression of the inhibit@@ ing class P @-@ sel@@ ess on end@@ oth@@ eli@@ al cells .
a clinical study involving multiple doses of which was administered in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statistically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , in a dose of 45 mg a day ( the Ne@@ ver@@ nal of the clinical dose ) was administered over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c intervals .
in a single dos@@ cope study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement variables of the flight power , including the ampli@@ fication of sub@@ jective and tasks that are connected to the flies .
in patients with allergic rhin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the alle@@ vi@@ ation of symptoms such as Ni@@ ese , Nas@@ en@@ secre@@ tion and it@@ chy of nose , it@@ chy , tr@@ ams and red@@ ness of eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rhin@@ itis is divided into dependence on the duration of symptoms alternatively in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as an appearance of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
per@@ sist@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as an appearance of symptoms of 4 or more days a week , and more than 4 weeks .
as indicated by the total of questionn@@ aire to quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ jun@@ c@@ tiv@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the burden of allergic rhin@@ itis .
the chron@@ ically idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ ti@@ car@@ ia ass@@ ess@@ ments for further forms of prim@@ itive ology , as the underlying path@@ ology of path@@ ology is similar to different shapes and chronic patients can be recru@@ ited simple pro@@ spective .
as the hist@@ am@@ inated factor in all ur@@ gical diseases is expected that Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is expected to improve the symptoms of prim@@ itive idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ inary in other forms of the prim@@ itive ia ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidelines .
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ ti@@ car@@ ia , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the improvement of p@@ inn@@ itus and the amount of squares at the end of the first dose intervals .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines of chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ ti@@ car@@ ia , the minority of patients who did not re@@ acted on anti@@ hist@@ amine of the study .
an improvement in the it@@ ching of more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine treated patients compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and consciousness as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to assess this variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etics study , in which the patients were comparable with the general seasonal allerg@@ y rhin@@ itis , a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine was achieved in 4 % of patients .
there are no advice points for clinical @-@ relevant cum@@ ulus to once daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine ( 5 @-@ 20 mg ) over 14 days .
however , this is not yet identified for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , however , inter@@ actions with other medicines are not entirely excluded .
des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in@@ hib@@ its in @-@ vi@@ vo no CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies that the drug CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 is in@@ hib@@ ited and neither a sub@@ strate is nor a inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ one .
in a single dos@@ sier , with disin@@ lor@@ at@@ ine , in a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( fet@@ ched , cal@@ orie rich breakfast ) does not affect the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin .

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals , to prevent symptoms of allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ) and Ur@@ ti@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the pres@@ cription physician should be aware of that most cases of rhin@@ itis in children under 2 years are caused by an infection ( see under Section 4.4 ) and that no data are fore@@ seen that support a treatment of inf@@ ectious rhin@@ itis with A@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to the exclusion of upper re@@ spir@@ atory infections or anatom@@ ical an@@ om@@ al@@ ies , the anti@@ bodies , physical investigations and appropriate laboratory and skin examinations were to play a role .
approximately 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years metab@@ oli@@ zed Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine and find out a higher sub@@ sid@@ y load ( see under Section 5.2 ) .
the security of A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up in children between 2 and 11 years , limited metab@@ oli@@ zation , is identical to that of children that metab@@ oli@@ zed normal .
this medication contains su@@ cro@@ se and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore patients with her@@ edit@@ ary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose @-@ tolerance , glucose @-@ g@@ act@@ ose absorption or in@@ suff@@ iciency of this medication should not be taken .

in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol was not strengthened by alcohol ( see below section 5.1 ) .
the total @-@ sensitivity of the side effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up Group similar to the placebo group .
in clinical trials with adults and adolescents in various indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ ti@@ car@@ ia , were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us in patients who were treated with placebo .
in a multiple @-@ dose study on adults and adolescents , with up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine ( Ne@@ ver@@ nal clinical dose ) were given , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
children aged between 1 and 11 years of age , who were given to an anti@@ hist@@ amine treatment , received a daily disin@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine dose of 1.25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic rhin@@ itis / chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ ti@@ car@@ ia and the profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in adults and children , the efficacy data of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population .
a clinical study involving multiple doses of adults and adolescents , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was used over 14 days a day , no statistically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study on adults and adolescents , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , in a dose of 45 mg a day ( the Ne@@ ver@@ nal of clinical dose ) was applied for ten days in adults , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c intervals .
in controlled clinical studies , the recommended dose of 5 m@@ g. daily for adults and adolescents has no increased incidence of dro@@ w@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo .
for a single @-@ day dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets resulted in adults and adolescents in clinical trials to no impair@@ ment of the psych@@ os@@ or@@ ic .
in clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , there was neither the simultaneous intake of alcohol not to gain alcohol @-@ induced performance impair@@ ment in an increase of the dro@@ w@@ sin@@ ess .
for adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rhin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in the alle@@ vi@@ ation of symptoms such as Ni@@ ese , Nas@@ en@@ secre@@ tion and it@@ chy of nose , it@@ chy flow and red@@ ness of eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate .
as indicated by the total of questionn@@ aire to quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tiv@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets are effectively caused by seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis .
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ ti@@ car@@ ia , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the improvement of p@@ inn@@ itus and the amount of squares at the end of the first dose intervals .
the spread of this limited metab@@ olic phen@@ otyp@@ s was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both popul@@ ations bigger in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Cau@@ cas@@ ian ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic multi @-@ dose study with the si@@ ob@@ form@@ ulations of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rhin@@ itis , fully oli@@ zed .
the load ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was approximately 6 to 6 hours approximately 6 times higher and the C@@ max approximately 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ time of about 120 hours .
there are no information points for clinical @-@ relevant active substance cum@@ ulation according to once daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine ( 5- 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .

June 2008 Nov@@ art@@ is V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. was officially appointed to the Committee of Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) that the company takes on approval for placing A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov to prevention of avi@@ aries H5@@ N1 influenza in adults and elderly people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and older people to protect against flu , caused by the trunk ( type ) H5@@ N1 of influenza A @-@ virus .
this is a special type of vaccine that could protect from a trunk of influenza , which could cause future pan@@ de@@ mic .
an influenza pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new trunk of flu virus occurred , who can easily distribute man by man because humans have no immun@@ ity ( no protection ) .
after administration of the vaccine , the immune system det@@ ects the parts of the Gri@@ pp@@ ev@@ irus as &quot; physical @-@ foreign &quot; and forms an antibody .
as a result , the immune system was later able to form a contact with a flu virus of this stem .
afterwards , the membrane cover of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on membran@@ es that recognize the human body as physical am@@ bush ) are separated , cleaned and used as part of the vaccine .
a inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not conducted in accordance with the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
as a result , the amount of clinical data based on the safety of vacc@@ ines did not comply with the requirements of the guidelines of the EMEA for preventive vacc@@ ines .
if you need to participate in a clinical trial and require further information regarding your treatment , please contact your treatment doctor .
if you wish to wish further information regarding the recommendations of CH@@ MP , please read scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years , which are infected with the human immun@@ ode@@ ficiency syndrome type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) which caused the acquired immun@@ ode@@ ficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who cannot swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ gen@@ ase is available as a solution to take @-@ up , but this cannot be taken together with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , because the safety of this combination was not investigated .
A@@ gen@@ ase should only be prescribed if the physician has tested , which has previously tested the an@@ tivir@@ al medicines of the patient before , and the lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood of being evaluated that the virus will be entrusted to the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , taken together with 100 mg r@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r daily and with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines .
for children between four and twelve years and with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ gen@@ ase is aimed at body weight .
gen@@ ase reduces the HIV @-@ amount of blood in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines in the blood and keeps them at low level .
AIDS is not able to cure AIDS . however , the fusion of the immune system and thereby improves the development of AIDS @-@ related infections and diseases .
A@@ gen@@ ase has been studied in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines , however without R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who were previously treated with prot@@ otyp@@ ed numbers .
this with low do@@ si@@ avi@@ r increased medicine A@@ gen@@ ase has been compared with 206 adults who had taken earlier prot@@ ectors , with other types of proteins .
principal inde@@ b@@ ator for efficacy was the proportion of patients with det@@ ec@@ table concentrations of HIV in the blood ( Vir@@ us@@ last ) or the change of vir@@ us@@ last after treatment .
in the studies with patients who had previously taken no prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , after 48 weeks , more patients had a vir@@ us@@ load under 400 copies / ml than placebo , but A@@ gen@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children the vir@@ ul@@ ls also reduced the vir@@ us@@ load , but with the children who had been treated earlier with prot@@ ectors , only very few to the treatment .
in the study with adults who had been treated earlier with prot@@ ectors , sen@@ i@@ ju@@ r ampli@@ fies the vir@@ us@@ load to 16 weeks of treatment as effective as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
in patients with HIV , that was resistant to four other proteins , it came under A@@ gen@@ ase , along with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r to an increase of vir@@ us@@ last after four weeks , who had taken care of their previous release .
the most common adverse events of A@@ gen@@ ase ( ob@@ serves more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ( di@@ arr@@ he@@ a ) , Nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , vom@@ iting , r@@ ash and Fati@@ gue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ gen@@ ase may not be applied in patients who are possibly super@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against am@@ b@@ avi@@ r or one of the other components .
A@@ gen@@ ase may also not be applied in patients , the cur@@ rant herb ( a vegetable preparation for treatment of depression ) or medic@@ inal products that are equally high as A@@ gen@@ ase , are to be taken in high concentrations in the blood of harmful .
as with other medicines for HIV , the ap@@ ur@@ g ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , an oste@@ opor@@ osis ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , or an immun@@ ity activation ( symptoms of an infection that caused the rest@@ oring immune system ) .
at the end , the Committee of Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of A@@ gen@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines for treating HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected adults and children over four years were overwhel@@ med with the risks .
A@@ gen@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ et@@ ical amplifier R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the Committee set out that the benefits of A@@ gen@@ ase in combination with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who have previously not detected any prot@@ ease .
A@@ gen@@ ase was originally approved in &quot; extraordinary circumstances , as it has only limited information templates at the time of approval for scientific reasons .
in October 2000 , the European Commission issued a approval for the company Gla@@ xo Group Limited for the placing on the market of A@@ gen@@ ase in the entire European Union .
gen@@ ase is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines for treating HIV @-@ 1- infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or ( PI ) -@@ pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .
for usually , A@@ gen@@ ase capsules should be administered to the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ et@@ etic booster set of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r , together with low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ ca@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r should be carried out in consideration of the individual vir@@ al resist@@ ors and the previous treatment of patients ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r as a solution for injection is 14 % lower than by am@@ b@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore , A@@ gen@@ ase capsules and solution can not be inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram per millimeter ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gen@@ ase capsules is 600 mg of am@@ b@@ avi@@ r twice daily together with 100 mg of R@@ it@@ on@@ ca@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines .
2 If A@@ gen@@ ase capsules shall be applied without the ampli@@ fication of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( booster ) , higher doses have to be applied to A@@ gen@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gen@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of am@@ b@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines of up to a daily intake of 2400 mg of am@@ b@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etics , efficacy and safety of A@@ gen@@ ase in combination with low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other proteins , were not investigated in children .
gen@@ ase is not recommended for application in children under 4 years of age , due to the absence of data concerning the un@@ think@@ able and effectiveness ( see section 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ et@@ etic data the dose of A@@ gen@@ ase capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily in adult patients with severe liver function , to 300 mg twice daily .
con@@ current use should be done in patients with mild or regular liver function with cau@@ tion , in patients with severe liver function , it is con@@ tra @-@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
gen@@ ase may not be given simultaneously with drugs which have a low therapeutic width and sub@@ str@@ ates the sub@@ str@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ da ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations , the cur@@ rant herb ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ ation ) included , may not be used due to risk reduction in plasma concentrations and a di@@ min@@ ished therapeutic effect of am@@ b@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
the patients should be pointed out that A@@ gen@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy do not lead to the healing of HIV infection and that they may also develop opportun@@ istic infections or other comp@@ lications of a HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy including treatment with A@@ gen@@ ase prevents the risk of transfer from HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for usually A@@ gen@@ ase capsules are to be used together with low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ ca@@ r and combined with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients who suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy have increased risk of heavy liver effects involving potentially fatal behaviour .
for the fall of simultaneous an@@ tivir@@ al treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant information about this medicine .
patients with existing reduced liver function , including a chronic active hepatitis indicate an increased frequency of liver function , under an anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous use of A@@ gen@@ ase and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r with fluor@@ ti@@ c@@ ason or other Glu@@ k@@ ok@@ or@@ tic is not recommended unless the potential for the treatment of system@@ ic cor@@ ost@@ ero@@ i@@ der effects including Mor@@ bus C@@ ushing and reg@@ ression of the minor function ( see section 4.5 ) .
since the inc@@ iner@@ ation of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ a reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin strongly dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is not recommended for the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ ol@@ y@@ sen .
4 For some medicines that may cause serious or physical effects , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and War@@ far@@ in ( under surveillance of the International standardi@@ zation ratio ) are available methods .
in patients receiving this medicine at the same time , A@@ gen@@ ase can be effective because of reduced plasma cutting of am@@ b@@ avi@@ r less ( see section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of metab@@ olic interaction with am@@ b@@ avi@@ r , the efficacy of hormon@@ al contra@@ diction can be changed , but the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of inter@@ actions .
if meth@@ ad@@ on is given with am@@ b@@ avi@@ r at the same time , the patient should therefore be monitored on op@@ iat@@ ry symptoms , in particular if it is still very low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ ca@@ r .
due to the possible risk of tox@@ icity of a tox@@ icity in children under the age of four years , this formulation is indicated for children under an age of four years and should be used with care of certain other patient groups .
gen@@ ase should be set on duration 5 if a r@@ ash occurs of system@@ ic or allergic symptoms or allergic symptoms , or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
in patients who received anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy including protein inhibit@@ or , was reported about the appearance of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia or an ex@@ hal@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus .
many of the patients had other diseases resulting from cancer medicines that were associated with the development of a diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , or hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia .
B. higher age , and with pharmac@@ euticals factors such as long lasting anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al treatment and associated metab@@ olic disorders , associated .
in hem@@ oph@@ ile patients ( type A and B ) , which were treated with prot@@ otyp@@ ed numbers , reports about an increase of blood charges including spontaneous hel@@ em@@ ic hem@@ at@@ oms and hem@@ mar@@ thro@@ sen .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune effect can become a inflamm@@ atory reaction to as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ du@@ ical opportun@@ istic infections that leads to severe clinical trials or deteri@@ oration of symptoms .
although an Multi@@ fac@@ tor@@ ial Et@@ ti@@ ology is assumed ( including application of cor@@ ost@@ ero@@ ids , alcohol consumption , severe immune disease , higher body composition index ) , cases of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term application of anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy ( ART ) .
CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width A@@ gen@@ ase must not simultaneously have a low therapeutic width and sub@@ str@@ ates the sub@@ str@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ da ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width A@@ gen@@ ase with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r must not be used together with pharmac@@ euticals , its active ingredients are predominantly through CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ingredients and the increased plasma cutting with severe and / or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes an 82 % reduction in AU@@ C by am@@ b@@ avi@@ r which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and lead to resistance development .
attemp@@ ting to balance the plasma concentration by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , were very often undes@@ ired effects on the liver .
cur@@ rant herb ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ ation ) The ser@@ um mirror of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r can be decreased by the simultaneous use of bot@@ an@@ ks ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ ation ) .
if a patient has already taken s cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ ine , am@@ on@@ av@@ ir@@ l mirror and if possible to check the virus or the cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ ine .
a dose custom@@ ization for any of the medicine is not necessary when Nel@@ ly avi@@ r is administered along with Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r ( see also e@@ ast@@ ray below ) .
508 % increased , if R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ b@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with am@@ bo@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical studies , doses of 600 mg Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r were applied twice daily and R@@ it@@ on@@ ca@@ r 100 mg twice daily , to prove the effectiveness and un@@ think@@ able of this treatment schem@@ at@@ as .
52 % lower , if am@@ b@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) is administered in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg L@@ ill@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg r@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which was achieved during combination of am@@ b@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with cal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of ra@@ it@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg of R@@ it@@ on@@ ca@@ r twice daily .
a dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of am@@ b@@ avi@@ r and cal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , it is recommended that the effectiveness and in@@ justice of this combination is not known .
there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ et@@ ical study in combination with di@@ chlor@@ os@@ ene , but is recommended because of the ant@@ a@@ zi@@ vel component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , however , the revenue of di@@ than@@ os@@ ine and ap@@ ur@@ g are at least one hour ( see ant@@ acids below ) .
for this reason a dose of dose ir@@ on@@ ably ( 600 mg twice daily ) and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) is not necessary in combination with am@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) .
the treatment with ov@@ ir@@ on@@ ably in combination with am@@ b@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended because the exposure of both protests had low .
the effects of Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ ine to other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or and existing data can be scattered that Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ ine could possibly rise to the ser@@ um concentration of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r .
if these medicines should be used simultaneously , cau@@ tion is careful because Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din might be less effective because of reducing or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma cutting .
when these medicines will be applied together , cau@@ tion ; a thor@@ ough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical surveillance should be done , as a precise pre@@ diction the effect of combination of am@@ b@@ avi@@ r and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r to Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din is difficult .
the simultaneous gift of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ ol@@ ut@@ in resulted in an increase of plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) of Ri@@ ol@@ ut@@ in by 193 % , thereby related to an increase in Ri@@ ol@@ ut@@ in side effects .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons , Ri@@ ol@@ ut@@ in together with A@@ gen@@ ase is to be administered in at least half of the recommended dose , although there is no clinical data .
pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic studies with A@@ gen@@ ase in combination with Er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in were not performed , but the plasma cutting of both medic@@ inal products could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration .
simultaneous use of two times a day , 700 mg F@@ os@@ amp@@ ra@@ r and 100 mg of R@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once a day lead to 2,@@ 69@@ fold compared to the value that was observed after 200 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once a day without simultaneous use of F@@ os@@ amp@@ er avi@@ r with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines that are listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , inhibit@@ or or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can be used together with A@@ gen@@ ase , possibly to inter@@ actions .
patients should therefore be linked to toxic reactions to be monitored by these medicines when they are used in combination with A@@ gen@@ ase .
based on the data of other proteins , it is advis@@ able that ant@@ acids are not taken at the same time as A@@ gen@@ ase , since it can come to res@@ or@@ ption distur@@ ban@@ ces .
the con@@ current application of anti@@ con@@ vul@@ si@@ va , known as an enzyme ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r can lead to am@@ b@@ lower plasma welding of am@@ b@@ avi@@ r .
the ser@@ um concentrations of calcium block@@ ers like Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , odi@@ odi@@ pine , ni@@ odi@@ pin , n@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , n@@ isol@@ di@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased 10 by am@@ b@@ avi@@ r , thereby reducing the activity and tox@@ icity of this medicine .
simultaneous taking with A@@ gen@@ ase can increase their plasma concentrations in conjunction with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors or associated side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ review , tend@@ encies and prim@@ ap@@ hor@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study , in R@@ it@@ on@@ ca@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily together with 50 µg flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) were significantly reduced during the end@@ ogen@@ ous K@@ ort@@ is@@ ol rose by approximately 86 % ( 90 % interval between 82 and 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous gift of ap@@ arth@@ ra with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended that the potential for the treatment of a treatment is the risk of system@@ ic cor@@ si@@ ero@@ i@@ ost@@ ero@@ i@@ der effects ( see section 4.4 ) .
in case of H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ a reduc@@ t@@ ase , such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , which varies greatly from CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are to anticip@@ ate increasing increases from plasma cutting in simultaneous administration of A@@ gen@@ ase .
as plasma levels of these H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors are not recommended for my@@ opath@@ y including a R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ y@@ sis , the combined application of this medicine is not recommended with Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r .
it is a common monitoring of therapeutic concentrations as to stabil@@ ization of the mirror , as the plasma concentration of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ yc@@ in and T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us can be increased in simultaneous gift of am@@ b@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) .
hence , A@@ gen@@ ase may not be applied together with oral gen@@ om@@ men@@ em Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) while using the same application of A@@ gen@@ z@@ ol@@ am is recommended .
data for the simultaneous use of par@@ ab@@ olic Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ eas@@ ant inhibit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in plasma cutting by Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am around 3 @-@ 4 @-@ watch .
when meth@@ ad@@ on is administered or@@ b@@ r with Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r , the patient should therefore be monitored on op@@ iat@@ ry symptoms , in particular if they are still very low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ ca@@ r .
because of its extremely low distortion of the same time , no recommendation can be given , as the am@@ bo@@ b@@ avi@@ r dose is given at the same time when am@@ bo@@ b@@ r is given with Meth@@ ad@@ on .
in case of simultaneous gift of War@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , an increased control of IN@@ R ( International standardi@@ zation ratio ) is recommended because of the possibility of a weaker or ampli@@ fication of anti@@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contra@@ cep@@ hal@@ a is not predic@@ table , therefore also recommended methods for the conception .
a careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ til@@ in ) is recommended for the same gift of A@@ gen@@ ase ( see section 4.4 ) .
this medicine may only be applied during pregnancy after more di@@ lution of the potential of the potential for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for fo@@ et@@ us .
in the milk l@@ activation rats , am@@ b@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances were detected , however , it is not known whether Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r is transferred to humans in breast milk .
a reproduction study on tr@@ unk@@ y rats , of which was administered by am@@ ni@@ st@@ ung in the uter@@ us until the end of the breast@@ feeding Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r , showed a reduced increase in 12 body weight loss .
further development of income including fertil@@ ity and re@@ productive capacity was not imp@@ aired by the administration of am@@ b@@ avi@@ r to the parent .
the in@@ justice of A@@ gen@@ ase has been studied in adults and children over 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with different other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines .
most cases related to the A@@ gen@@ ase treatment were slightly up to moderate , performed early on and led rarely to the treatment of treatment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with many of these events , it is not clari@@ fied whether they are related to the medicine or other medicines at the same time , or if they are a consequence of the re@@ under@@ disease . &quot; &quot; &quot;
most of the above side effects were from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 3@@ 001 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which with prot@@ agon@@ ists did not receive 1200 mg of A@@ gen@@ ase twice daily .
events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) , which were evaluated by the investig@@ ator as related to the study medication , and in more than 1 % of patients were performed , as well as under the treatment of laboratory changes ( degrees 3 to 4 ) .
the anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy was associated with a distribution of the body fat ( Li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ rophy ) of HIV @-@ patients , including a loss of peri@@ pher@@ als , intra@@ ocular and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissue , hyper@@ t@@ rophy of the breasts and dor@@ so@@ vi@@ al fat collection ( Sti@@ ff neck ) .
below 113 anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al not previously treated persons treated with Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r in combination with Lam@@ iv@@ ud@@ in / Z@@ id@@ ov@@ ud@@ in over a middle duration of 36 weeks was observed , only one case ( Sti@@ ff neck ) was observed ( &lt; 1 % ) .
in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 , 245 N@@ R@@ TI@@ - previously treated patients under Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) of 241 patients with in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with various N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over an average duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) .
skin supplements normally were slightly up to moderate , ery@@ them@@ atic or ma@@ cular nature , with or without it@@ ching and occurred during the second course of treatment and disappeared spont@@ ane@@ ously during two weeks without the treatment with Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r had to be canc@@ eled .
cases of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose were reported in particular in patients with general risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term application of anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy ( ART ) .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune effect can become a inflamm@@ atory reaction to as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ du@@ ical opportun@@ istic infections ( see section 4.4 ) .
in PI pre @-@ treated patients , the 600 mg of A@@ gen@@ ase were observed twice daily along with low do@@ si@@ ri@@ avi@@ r ( Grade 3 to 4 ) and of laboratory ( Grade 3 to 4 ) and of laboratory ( Grade 3 to 4 ) , patients who received A@@ gen@@ ase combined with low do@@ si@@ ri@@ avi@@ r in patients who were very frequent .
in case of an over@@ dosage , the patient is observed in the signs of an in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) if necessary , necessary support measures are necessary .

an@@ tivir@@ al activity of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r in vitro by HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was examined in both acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ bl@@ ast@@ ical cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , C@@ em @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as to peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ b@@ avi@@ r lies in the range from 0,0@@ 12 to 0,@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M with chronic infected cells
the connection between the activity of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the inhibit@@ or of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al not pre @-@ treated patients with the currently approved F@@ os@@ amp@@ ser@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r doses have been observed - as described in other R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r used treatment schem@@ as - the mut@@ ations described only rarely observed .
in sixteen of 434 patients who received anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al not previously treated patients who received 700@@ mg of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in the ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 study , a vi@@ ro@@ log@@ istic failure were evaluated up to 48 , with 14 isol@@ ates gen@@ otyp@@ ic .
gen@@ otyp@@ ical analysis of Isol@@ ate of 13 of 14 children , where a vi@@ ro@@ log@@ istic failure in the 59 were included , with prot@@ otyp@@ ing not previously treated patients showed resistance samples which were similar to those in adults .

in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 study and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg F@@ os@@ amp@@ ser@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) in patients with their prot@@ agon@@ ists previously treated patients showed more than 96 weeks in patients with the following proteins .
gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis based analyses Gen@@ otyp@@ ical interpretation systems can be used for estim@@ ation of activity of am@@ b@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or resistant isol@@ ates .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for f@@ os@@ he@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance than the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 147@@ A / S / M / M / S / M / M / S / M / M / M / S / G , I@@ 84@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M associated with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r as well as a reduced probability of a vi@@ ro@@ logical response ( resistance ) .
the conclusions are subject to the relev@@ ance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation date , changes may be subject to additional data , and it is recommended to at@@ tract the current interpretation systems for analysis of resistance tests .
phen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis based analyses clin@@ ically vali@@ dated phen@@ otyp@@ ical interpretation systems can be used in combination with the gen@@ otyp@@ ical data relating to the activity of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with inhibit@@ or inhibit@@ or isol@@ ates .
companies that distribute diagnostic resistance tests , clin@@ ically developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ offs ( separation points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV that can be used to interpre@@ ting results of a resistance tests .
each of these four with a reduced sensitivity against Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r associated genetic patterns produces a certain cross @-@ resistant against R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity against In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ ly avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remain in general .
there are currently data available for cross @-@ resistance between Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r and other types of proteins for all 4 F@@ os@@ amp@@ er avi@@ r Resist@@ en@@ ade , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
based on twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al not previously treated patients , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 Isol@@ ate ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Tip@@ ran@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 isol@@ ates ) .
the am@@ bo@@ avi@@ r reserves its activity against some other prot@@ ectors of inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ate ; receiving of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and of the type of resistance mut@@ ations in the insulation .
early termination of a failed therapy is recommended to keep the he@@ ave of a variety of mut@@ ations in limits that can act on the subsequent treatment .
the receipt of the efficacy of A@@ gen@@ ase in combination with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized open study ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) and a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , mainly with lowest r@@ it@@ on@@ vi@@ r , &quot; received .
one hundred and thre@@ es@@ core ( n = 163 ) patients with subsequent virus sensitivity to A@@ gen@@ ase , at least one other PI and at least one N@@ RT@@ I were included in the study study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis introduced the non @-@ sub @-@ peri@@ ority of AP@@ V / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the present @-@ adjusted average change of the output ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in plasma after 16 weeks , with non @-@ sub @-@ cell shaft by 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the receipt of the efficacy of un@@ born A@@ gen@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials with 288 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 were treated with PI .
in the studies , A@@ gen@@ ase solution was administered three times a day , 20 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , while the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily .
there was no low @-@ do@@ si@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of PI previously treated patients had at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s .
after 48 weeks , about 25 % of the patients included a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase of CD@@ 4 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value .
19 Based on these data , should be considered due to the expected benefits of &quot; un@@ for@@ oo@@ ster@@ ed &quot; A@@ gen@@ ase to be considered .
according to oral administration , the average duration ( T@@ max ) to the maximum ser@@ um concentration of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
508 % increased for C@@ max in contrast to 30 % , when R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered with Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
administration of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease of AU@@ C but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ b@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady @-@ State ( C@@ min , ss ) remains un@@ affected by the food intake , although the simultaneous food intake increases the extent and rate of res@@ or@@ ption .
the apparent field of distribution is approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be connected to a large distribution volume and an imper@@ ative penetration of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r from the blood circuit in the tissue .
this change will result in a decrease of the total concentration of the active ingre@@ dient in plasma , with the amount of untreated am@@ b@@ avi@@ r which represents the active share probably remains unchanged .

for the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream directly in connection with other cut@@ aneous app@@ ic@@ ured funds for the treatment of external fet@@ us in the gen@@ ital and interval range there are no clinical experiences yet .
limited data indicate an increased rate of F@@ eig@@ n reductions in HIV @-@ positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream has shown a lower effect in this patient group .
treatment of the bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the eyel@@ ids , the nose , the lips or the hair was not examined .
local skin reactions are frequent , but the intensity of these responses decreases in general during therapy or the reactions are after completion of the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if it is necessary due to the complaints of the patient or the sever@@ ity of local skin reactions , a treatment break may be made of several days .
the clinical outcome of therapy can be assessed according to re@@ generating the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
since currently no data on long @-@ term healing rates of over 36 months after treatment are available , other suitable therap@@ y@@ car@@ cin@@ oma were supposed to be taken into consideration .
in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated B@@ CC@@ s there are no clinical experiences yet , therefore the application is not recommended in pre @-@ treated tum@@ ors .
data from an open clinical study indicate that with large tum@@ ours ( &gt; 7,@@ 25 cm2 ) a lower probability of response to the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy exists .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not investigated for treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ os on eyel@@ ids , inside of the nose or ears or in the lift area within the stair@@ way .
there are only very limited data about the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od in the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ os in anatom@@ ical places outside the face and the scal@@ p .
the available data about the ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ osis to the fore@@ arms and hands do not support the effectiveness of this application , therefore such use is not recommended .
local skin reactions are often found , but these reactions have normally recorded during therapy to intensity or go back after the treatment of therapy with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the local skin reactions to the patient must cause great dis@@ comfort , or very strong , the treatment can be suspended for a few days . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the data of an open clinical study that patients with more than 8 files have been raised by lower total re@@ medy rate than patients with less than 8 les@@ ions .
due to the immune stim@@ ulating properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od should be used with cau@@ tion ( see 4.4 ) .
for animal studies , there are no direct or indirect effects on the pregnancy , embry@@ onic / f@@ öt@@ al development , a child@@ birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) .
even though either after one @-@ time top@@ ical application of qu@@ anti@@ fiable ser@@ um levels ( &gt; 5@@ n@@ g / ml ) , no recommendation can be given for use during the breast@@ feeding .
the most frequently asked , probably or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream in connection side effects associated with three @-@ week treatment ( 3@@ 3.7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated patients ) .
most recently reported or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream in connection side effects include complaints at application areas with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % .
the bas@@ ali@@ om @-@ cream @-@ treated patients treated by 185 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream from a placebo @-@ controlled clinical study of the phase III side effects are listed below .
the most frequent , probably or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream in connection to the application were an reaction to the applic@@ ations@@ location ( 22 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated patients ) .
adverse events that were evaluated by 252 in placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies of Phase III with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream treated patients with ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ osis are listed below .
this according to audit plan shows that in these a placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream often indicates local skin reactions including ery@@ them ( 61 % ) , Ex@@ c@@ ori@@ ation / Ab@@ y@@ ss ( 23 % ) and Ö@@ 1 ( 14 % ) ( see section 4.4 ) .
this according to audit plan shows that in these studies with a five @-@ week treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream common to severe refresh@@ ments ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sion ( 13 % ) , and severe sl@@ ur@@ ry and seafood ( 19 % ) arrived .
in clinical studies for investig@@ ating I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment for the treatment of the ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ osis , Alo@@ e was diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment centre or in the ambient area .
the se@@ eable one @-@ off @-@ off intake of 200 mg I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the content of about 16 bags may cause nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , head@@ ache , and fever .
the clin@@ ically heavy side effects , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , consisted in hyp@@ ot@@ onia which normal@@ ized themselves after oral or intraven@@ ous liquids .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic examination , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od were detected on the top@@ ical use of the al@@ pha@@ bet and other cy@@ to@@ k@@ ine .
in 3 piv@@ ot@@ al Phase 3 efficacy studies could be shown that the efficacy in relation to a full healing of the fet@@ us at an I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment can be clearly superior over 16 weeks of placebo .
in 60 % of all patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated the fet@@ ters completely from ; this was 20 % of the 105 with placebo patients ( 95 % CI ) :
a full healing could be achieved at 23 % of 157 patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated male patients , compared to 5 % from 161 patients treated with placebo ( 95 % CI ) :
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od in five @-@ time application per week over 6 weeks was investigated in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies .
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed individual primary super@@ fe@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma with a minimum size of 0.5 cm2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
the data from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study on four years of present data show that approximately 7@@ 9.3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.7 % , 8@@ 4.9 % ) of all treated patients were clin@@ ically isolated and this remained for 48 months .
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od in one or two treatment courses of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment @-@ free period , was investigated in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies .
patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non @-@ hyper@@ ker@@ at@@ otic , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ ic acid than in a inter@@ act 25 cm2 treatment area than on the un@@ hair@@ less scal@@ p or in face .
initial observation period of two combined observation studies show a recur@@ ren@@ di@@ ment rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) after one or two treatment courses .
the approved indications of external events , ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ osis and super@@ fi@@ ci@@ elles bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma are generally not tested and were not examined .
Al@@ dar@@ a cream has been studied in four randomised , double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled studies at children aged 2 to 15 with m@@ oll@@ us@@ c@@ um Cont@@ agi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 576 , placebo n = 313 ) .
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies at the dos@@ ages ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks
a minimum system@@ ic intake of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream caused by the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ osis was observed during the three times weekly application during 16 weeks .
the highest pharmaceutical concentrations in ser@@ um at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours , and lived 0.1 , 0.2 and 1,6 g / ml in the application in the skin ( 12.5 mg , 2 bags ) and in the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the calculated half @-@ life time was approximately 10 times higher than the 2@@ hour half @-@ time after sub@@ cut@@ aneous application in a former study ; that indicates an extended re@@ treat of the medicine in the skin .
the data on system@@ ic exposition showed that the res@@ or@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od on MC @-@ 12 years was low and comparable was comparable to healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ osis or super@@ fi@@ ber@@ mic bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month trial for derm@@ al tox@@ icity at the rat resulted in significantly reduced doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg kg . a study carried out in this study showed no similar effects for four months .
a two @-@ year study for car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ icity in mice was induced in three days a week , no tum@@ ours involved in the application area .
the appropriate mechanism is not known but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od is only a small system@@ ic absorption of human skin and not mut@@ ilation is a risk for people because of the systematic exposure than very low .
the tum@@ ours were treated in the group of mice , which was treated with the efficiency @-@ free cream in earlier and in larger number as in the control group with less U@@ VR .
it may harm other people , even if these same symptoms have shown such as you . − If any of the adverse events do you significantly imp@@ airs any side effects , unless specified in this utility information please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ists .

in the study , mainly the safety of the medicine was investigated , however , its effectiveness was also measured by decre@@ asing the reduction of G@@ AG concentrations in the urine and in terms of the size of the liver .
in children under five years , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me knew the G@@ AG concentrations in the urine around 60 % , and half of the treated children showed a normal big liver at the end of the study .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed with more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , nau@@ sea , ab@@ dom@@ inal pain ( joint pain ) , sp@@ inal pain , pain in the li@@ mb@@ s ( in hands and feet ) , heat compassion , fever and reactions to the infusion centre .
very common adverse events in patients under five years are increased blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measurement size of lung function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ ate ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and sh@@ rub fro@@ st .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not react to patients who are possibly sensitive to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or one of the other components ( an@@ aph@@ yl@@ actic response ) , not used .
every year , the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will be any of all new information that may be announced , check and check this summary .
the manufacturers of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will receive patients to observe the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with respect to the reactions to the infusion and the development of anti@@ bodies .
June 2003 , the European Commission announced the company G@@ enzyme Europe BV permission for placing on the market of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in the entire European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a combin@@ ant form of human@@ oid α @-@ l @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using realistic DNA technology under the use of Ch@@ o @-@ mamm@@ al cell cultures ( Chinese Ham@@ ster O@@ ops , E@@ ier@@ stock of the Chinese painter ) .

treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be done by a physician , experience in the treatment of patients with MP@@ S I or other her@@ edit@@ ary metab@@ olic diseases .
the initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased once every 15 minutes to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h can be increased .
the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years was not determined , and for these patients cannot be recommended doses .
the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver in@@ suff@@ iciency has not been determined , and for these patients cannot be recommended doses .
with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me treated patients may develop in@@ fu@@ sion @-@ related reactions , which are defined as any other adverse events which occurs during the infusion , or until the end of the infusion day ( see section 4.8 ) .
for this reason , these patients should continue to be closely monitored , and the infusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out only in an appropriate clinical environment , in the revival facilities for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies immediately .
due to the Phase 3 clinical trial that virtually all patients Ig@@ G antibody being evaluated against Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the start of treatment .
patients who develop anti@@ bodies or symptoms of an in@@ infusion @-@ related reaction has to be treated with care of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see sections 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
as little experience regarding the recovery of the treatment after a longer break , it must be careful due to the theore@@ tically increased risk reaction after a dis@@ ruption of treatment .
60 minutes before the beginning of the infusion with medic@@ ations ( anti@@ hist@@ amine and / or anti@@ py@@ r@@ ka ) to minim@@ ize the potential occurr@@ ence related reactions .
in case of slight or intermediate @-@ related reaction , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and Par@@ ac@@ et@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen to be performed and / or a reduction of infusion rate to half the infusion rate in which the reaction has occurred .
in case of a single , severe in@@ fu@@ sions @-@ related reaction , infusion pump must be stopped , until the symptoms are dropped , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ ac@@ et@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is necessary .
the infusion can be achieved with a reduction of the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate when the reaction has occurred .
3 are given ( anti@@ hist@@ amine and par@@ ac@@ et@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) as well as a reduction of the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate when the previous reaction has occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be applied simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Proc@@ ain , because a potential risk of interference with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular recording of Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase exists .
animal experimental studies cannot be found on direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
since there is no data of new@@ bor@@ ns that were exp@@ on@@ ated towards lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase over the breast milk , is recommended to do during the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
the adverse reactions in clinical trials were collected as in@@ infusion @-@ related reactions , which were observed in 53 % of patients in the Phase 3 study ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study were observed under 5 years ( duration of treatment up to 1 year ) .
undes@@ irable drug inter@@ actions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , who were observed during the phase 3 years or older at a total treatment duration of up to 4 years , are commonly reported in the following table : very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with heavy MP@@ S @-@ I @-@ related participation of the upper re@@ spir@@ atory trac@@ ts and lung cancer , there were also heavy reactions , including bron@@ ch@@ ial enthusiasm , breathing space and visual acuity ( see section 4.4 ) .
children un@@ wanted drug inter@@ actions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , who were reported during a Phase 2 study , with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5 , with predominantly he@@ avier and a treatment duration of up to 12 months , are listed in the table .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
most patients came to a ser@@ op@@ o@@ con@@ version within 3 months after the treatment of the treatment , with a he@@ avi@@ est form mostly in one month at the age of 5 ( on average after 45 days in patients at the age of 5 years and older ) .
until the end of the phase 3 study ( or up to a premature departure from the study ) were found at 13 / 45 patients no det@@ ective anti@@ bodies ( R@@ IP ) Ass@@ ay , among them 3 patients who never came to Ser@@ concer@@ to .
patients with a lack of low antibody levels referred to a robust lowering of the G@@ AG mirror in Har@@ n , while in patients with high anti@@ bodies tit@@ res could determine a variable reduction of G@@ AG in Har@@ n .
four patients ( three in phase 3 trial and one in the Phase 2 study ) showed a mar@@ g@@ inal prop@@ ell@@ ous effect on the enz@@ ym@@ atic Lar@@ on@@ id@@ as@@ e- activity in vitro that seemed to affect the clinical efficacy and / or the reduction of G@@ AG in the Har@@ n .
the presence of anti@@ bodies seemed not to stand in connection with the incidence of undes@@ ired drug inter@@ actions , although the occurr@@ ence of un@@ wanted drug inter@@ actions were typically fell along with the formation of Ig@@ G anti@@ bodies .
the cause for the enzyme otherapy is in one of the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of accumulated sub@@ strate and the preventing a further accum@@ ulation of adequate restoration .
following an intraven@@ ous infusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is quickly removed from circulation and cells into ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most probably about Mann@@ ose @-@ 6 @-@ phosphate recept@@ ors .
the safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in a randomised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study enrolled 45 patients at the age of 6 to 43 years .
although patients were recru@@ ited for the study that had been recru@@ ited to the entire disease spectrum , the majority of patients from the mean phen@@ otype and just one patient showed the heavy phen@@ otype .
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a for@@ c@@ ely exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand for 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the effectiveness were the percentage of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute walk in the 6 @-@ minute walk @-@ test .
all patients were then recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study , where they received 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me every week for a further 3.5 years .
after 26 weeks of therapy , patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me treated patients with the placebo group an improvement of lung function and the ability to be shown in the following table .
when an open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintaining this effects of up to 208 weeks in der@@ al@@ der@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and 182 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ a group , as shown in the following table .
the decrease of the corresponding percentage of FE@@ V is not significantly more than this period clin@@ ically , and the absolute lung volume increased more than propor@@ tion@@ ately of growing children .
of the 26 patients with an hepat@@ oma preceding the treatment , 22 ( 85 % ) reached a normal liver size by the end of the study .
within the first 4 weeks a clear refuse of the G@@ AG mirror was established in Har@@ n ( µg / mg of cre@@ at@@ ine ) which remained constant until the end of the study .
in terms of the hetero@@ gen@@ eous disease manifest@@ ation between the patient , the clin@@ ically significant changes in the 6 @-@ minute walk @-@ test , motion range of the shoul@@ der@@ age group ( AH@@ I and visual acuity ) , was generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 22 % ) , no change in 9 patients ( 22 % ) and a deteri@@ oration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a one @-@ year @-@ old open phase 2 study was conducted in which mainly the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me was examined at 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years old ( 16 patients with severe dec@@ ay form and 4 with the mean shift form ) .
in four patients the dosing was increased due to increased G@@ AG@@ - mirror in Har@@ n in week 22 in the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg .
in several patients a magn@@ itude of magn@@ itude ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) was determined according to the Z Score for these age group ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with severe contamination @-@ form only limited or no progress in cogn@@ itive development .
in a phase 4 study , investigations into the co @-@ dynamic effects of various Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me doses of the G@@ AG mirror were carried out on the G@@ AG mirror in the Har@@ n , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dos@@ sh@@ ema with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can be found in patients who have difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions , but is not detected that the long @-@ term clinical efficacy of these two dosing schem@@ ata is equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will evaluate any new information that will evaluate annually , and if necessary , the summary of the attributes of the medicine will be updated .
pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic profile in patients at the age of 5 was similar to patients with older and less affected patients .

if the ready @-@ to @-@ use preparation is not immediately used , this will not be stored for more than 24 hours at 2 ° C - 8@@ º C unless the di@@ lution in controlled and vali@@ dated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions .
preparation of the al@@ dur@@ y@@ me infusion ( using as@@ ep@@ tic technique ) • J@@ e to body weight of the individual patients initially determine the number of diluted bottles .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with cis@@ plat@@ in ( a other medicines that can not be removed ) in patients , if cancer is not far away ( medicines for cancer ) . • advanced or metastatic , non @-@ type of lung cancer , which attacks not the plate epi@@ thel@@ ial cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used in patients who were previously not treated with cis@@ plat@@ in , in combination with cis@@ plat@@ in , and in patients who previously used other chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ies as sole treatment .
to reduce side effects , patients during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta should get a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid and foli@@ c acid ( a vitamin ) and get inj@@ ections of vitamin B12 .
if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered along with cis@@ plat@@ in , before or after the gift of Cis@@ plat@@ in , an &quot; anti@@ em@@ et@@ il &quot; ( medicines for vom@@ iting ) and liquids can be avoided .
in patients whose blood is changed , or of which certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be pushed for@@ ged , set up or reduced the dose .
the active form of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed s@@ lows the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells that cells split .
the conversion of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed in its active form is easier in cancer cells easier than in healthy cells , which leads to higher concentrations of the active form of the medicine and a longer period of effects in cancer cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta was investigated for the treatment of mal@@ ign@@ ant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ it@@ ome in a main study of 456 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ small lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study were compared to 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic breast cancer , previously compared to chemotherapy with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( any other medicines for cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared to gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( a further medicine against cancer ) , while both in combination with cis@@ plat@@ in in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients , previously had received no chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients who were treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and cis@@ plat@@ in were average 12,@@ 1 months , compared to 9.3 months in the sole administration of cis@@ plat@@ in .
in patients who previously received chemotherapy was the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta 8.3 months , compared to 7.9 months at doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
however , in both studies , patients who viol@@ ate the squ@@ am@@ ous epi@@ thel@@ ial cells , during the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta longer survival compared to cancer .
in September 2004 , the European Commission announced the company Eli Lil@@ ly Neder@@ land B.V. An approval for the placing on the market of A@@ lim@@ ta in the whole European Union .
any di@@ pping bottle must be dissolved with 4.2 ml 0.9 % sodium chloride injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary do@@ - sis is taken from the flow of blood and diluted with 0,9 % sodium chloride injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.6 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is shown in combination with cis@@ plat@@ in indicated for first @-@ line therapy from patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer except for predomin@@ ating ing@@ epi@@ thel@@ ial hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA in Mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with Lo@@ - K@@ al advanced or metastatic breast cancer ( in excess - Gender ) epi@@ thel@@ ial hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface area ( KO@@ F ) administered as an intraven@@ ous infusion over a period of 10 minutes at the first day every 21 day treatment course .
the recommended dose of cis@@ plat@@ in is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as infusion over a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after the end of the package In@@ fusion the first day every 21 day treatment course .
in patients with non @-@ small bronze car@@ cin@@ oma following previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered as an intraven@@ ous infusion for a period of 10 minutes the first day every 21 day treatment cycle .
the incidence of incidence and sever@@ ity of skin reactions have to be given a day before and on the day of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed gift as well as per day after treatment a cor@@ ost@@ ero@@ id .
during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ bo@@ xed , at least 5 doses of foli@@ c acid must be taken and the intake needs to be continued throughout the treatment duration and for another 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ate dose .
patients also need to receive in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection of vitamin B12 ( 1000 mc@@ g ) during the week before the first P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed dose as well as according to any third party .
in patients who received P@@ em@@ etric , should be created a complete ble@@ eding in particular , including differentiation of the leu@@ k@@ oc@@ ytes and a t@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ g@@ um@@ eration .
the alkal@@ ine case ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ at @-@ trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ anine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit .
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose review will take place under the consideration of the N@@ adi@@ rs of the blood picture or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity of the previous therapy cycles .
after recovery the patient must be treated according to the indications in the tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which can be used for AL@@ IM@@ TA as a mono@@ therap@@ y@@ or in combination with cis@@ plat@@ in .
these criteria meet the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ icity Crit@@ eria ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degree 2 ble@@ eding .
should patients do not develop hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ≥ degrees 3 ( except for neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity ) , treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA needs to be interrupted before patient receiving the value before treatment .
treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be canc@@ eled if in patients after 2 dose reduc@@ ers a hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity Grade 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - on the occurr@@ ence of degrees 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
clinical studies showed no indication that in patients at age 65 , or above , compared to patients at the age of 65 , an elevated side risk exists .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to lack of adequate data and effectiveness .
in clinical trials , a dose of ≥ 45 ml / min were not necessary in patients with a cre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min .
the data situation in patients with a Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with liver function limit of &gt; 1.5 times the upper Bil@@ ir@@ ub@@ in@@ - limit values and / or trans@@ amin@@ ases of &gt; to 3,0 fold the upper limit value ( at the presence of liver l@@ ungs ) are not specifically investigated in the studies .
patients must be monitored via the bone mar@@ cation and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed may not be administered to patients before the absolute neut@@ rop@@ hil@@ ly number has reached a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thro@@ mb@@ s has reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dose reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adir of absolute neut@@ rop@@ hil@@ ic number and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity , as observed in the previous treatment cycles - ( see section 4.2 ) .
a lower tox@@ icity and a reduction in Grade 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity such as neut@@ rop@@ enia , f@@ eb@@ r@@ ile neut@@ rop@@ enia and infection with degrees 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ enia was considered as a pre@@ treatment with foli@@ c acid and vitamin B12 .
therefore , all patients treated with P@@ em@@ etry @-@ treated patients must apply foli@@ c acid and vitamin B12 as proph@@ yl@@ actic acid to reduce treatment @-@ related tox@@ icity ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to medium kidney failure ( SN@@ SA@@ ID@@ s ) such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and ac@@ et@@ yl@@ s@@ ali@@ - c@@ yl@@ acid ( &gt; 1.3 g daily ) need to avoid late in@@ tox@@ icity and ac@@ et@@ yl@@ s@@ ali@@ - c@@ yl@@ acid ( &gt; 1.3 g daily ) for at least 2 days before the therapy , at least 2 days after therapy ( see section 4.5 ) .
all patients receiving treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed should have to avoid the intake of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with long half @-@ life time for at least 5 days before the therapy , the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.5 ) .
many patients where these events occurred , corresponding risk factors for the occurr@@ ence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing blood pressure or diabetes .
therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant liquid collection , the collection of the trans@@ cell@@ ular space is supposed to be a dra@@ ining of the ergonom@@ ical treatment before the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed treatment .
5 serious cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events were reported in clinical trials with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed occasionally , when this drug was usually administered in combination with a different cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic active substance .
for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ ed living materials ( except yellow fever , these vacc@@ ination is con@@ tra @-@ inde@@ xed ) not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
as the possibility of an ir@@ reversible skull of the re@@ productive capacity should be rejected by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed men before treatment , advice regarding sper@@ mac@@ eration .
in patients with normal ren@@ al function ( Kre@@ at@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of non @-@ ster@@ oid anti@@ ph@@ log@@ ist@@ ika ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s ) and ac@@ et@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ ylic acid in high dosage ( ≥ 1.3 g daily ) to a reduced P@@ em@@ etric pump outlet by a result of increased recovery of side effects .
therefore , cau@@ tion is recommended if in patients with normal ren@@ al function ( Kre@@ at@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ ylic acid can be used in high dosage .
I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or ac@@ et@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ - acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and minim@@ ally ( see section 4.4 ) .
since there are no data regarding the inter@@ actions potential using N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with long half @-@ time such as Pi@@ ro@@ x@@ x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous application must be avoided during therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - xed avoided .
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the mod@@ al status during the disease and the possibility of inter@@ actions between oral anti@@ o@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ al chemotherapy requires an increased supervision of IN@@ R ( International standardi@@ zation ratio ) when the decision was made to handle the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
there are no data for the use of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed to pregnant women but as with an@@ de@@ - anti@@ metabol@@ ites are expected to be severe in pregnancy .
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed may not be applied during pregnancy , except when necessary , and after careful dis@@ closure of the user for the mother and risk for the fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) .
as the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage to re@@ productive capacity due to p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be rejected before the treatment begins , advice regarding the sperm process .
it is not known that P@@ em@@ et@@ ra@@ xed in breast milk over@@ passes and undes@@ irable effects while st@@ illed mamm@@ ling cannot be excluded .

the primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients who received the examination medi@@ ation in the treatment arm ( random@@ ized and treated ) .
a statistically significant improvement of clinical symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ no@@ e ) in connection with the mal@@ ign@@ ant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ om was shown in the AL@@ IM@@ TA / cis@@ plat@@ in arm ( 212 patients ) compared to the sole cis@@ co @-@ arm ( 218 patients ) .
the differences between the two arms pul@@ s proved by an improvement of lung function parameters in AL@@ IM@@ TA / cis@@ plat@@ in arm and a deteri@@ oration of lung function during the following period .
a multi@@ center , randomised , open phase III study with AL@@ IM@@ TA against doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el in patients treated with locally advanced or metastatic NSC@@ LC after previous chemotherapy was diagnosed with AL@@ IM@@ TA ( In@@ side population n = 283 ) and of 7,9 months with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el treated patients ( ITT n = 288 ) .
an analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on the overall survival fell to favour of epi@@ thel@@ ial hist@@ ological type ( n = 399 , 9.3 versus 7.4 months , adapted HR = 1.@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1.0@@ 8 @-@ 2.@@ 26 , p = 0,0@@ 18 ) .

all@@ i may not be used by children and adolescents under 18 , because there is no sufficient information regarding the effectiveness and safety .
because Or@@ list@@ at is only minimal res@@ or@@ ated , it is necessary in case of elderly and patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function .

the probability of occurr@@ ence of gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal symptoms ( see section 4.8 ) may increase if all@@ i is taken together with a low @-@ fat @-@ meal or ob@@ ese diet .
as the weight reduction in diabetes , patients with improved metab@@ olic control should consult patients who consult a drug with all@@ i to consult a physician or pharmac@@ ists because the dosage of anti@@ di@@ abet@@ ics should be adapted .
patients receiving all@@ i as well as medicines for blood pressure or increased chol@@ ester@@ ol levels should take their doctor or pharmac@@ ists whether the dosage of this medicine needs to be adapted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is recommended to meet additional vibr@@ atory measures in order to prevent the case of serious di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea possible failure to prevent oral contra@@ dictions ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a study to inter@@ actions of medicines as well as in several cases , or@@ list@@ at and Cic@@ los@@ se was observed , a reduction of the Cic@@ los@@ se in Plas@@ m@@ asp@@ ire has been observed .
when applying War@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick @-@ values ( internationally standardized ratio , IN@@ R ) could be affected ( see section 4.8 ) .
most patients who were treated with or@@ list@@ at in clinical trials up to 4 full years , the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K as well as the beta car@@ ot@@ ene in the standard range .
however , the patient should be recommended to take a supplementary mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement to ensure a sufficient vit@@ amine photograph ( see section 4.4 ) .
after the gift of a single dose of A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one was observed in a limited number of healthy volunteers , which received tri@@ list@@ at , a mar@@ gin@@ ally decrease of the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration .
animal experimental studies showed no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of Or@@ list@@ at are mainly gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal nature and hang together with the pharmac@@ ological effects of the medicine , as the absorption of in@@ accurate fat is prevented .
the gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal side effects were determined from clinical trials involving 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally slightly and temporary .
as follows : very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , commonly ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( frequency on the basis of available data is not estimated ) .
the frequency of known adverse events that were detected after the launch of Or@@ list@@ at , is not known because these events were voluntarily reported by a population un@@ certain size .
† It is pl@@ au@@ sible for treatment with all@@ i to convert the treatment of possible or actual gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg of or@@ list@@ at and multiple boxes of up to 400 mg three times daily were administered over a period of 15 days to normal and overweight persons without significant clinical findings .
when most of the cases reported to be reported by Or@@ list@@ at @-@ Over@@ do@@ ation , cases of any side effects or similar effects were reported to be reported in place at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at .
based on humans and animal , it can be assumed by a rapid recovery of only system@@ ic effects that are attributable to the li@@ pas@@ cal properties of Or@@ list@@ at .
the therapeutic effect is set in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine of the active Ser@@ in @-@ rest of the gast@@ ric and pan@@ cre@@ atic li@@ pas@@ en .
clinical studies have been derived that 60 mg of Or@@ list@@ at taken three times a day , absorption of about 25 % of the food @-@ fat .
two double @-@ blind , randomised , placebo @-@ controlled studies on adults with a BMI of 28 kg / m2 , prove the efficacy of 60 mg Or@@ list@@ at , taken three times daily in combination with a hypo@@ cal@@ or@@ ic , fat @-@ induced diet .
the primary parameters , the change of body weight compared with the starting value ( at the time of Rand@@ om@@ ization ) , was given as follows : as a change of body weight in the course of study ( table 1 ) and for more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) .
although in both studies the weight reduction over 12 months was observed , the largest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months .
the average change in the overall chol@@ ester@@ ol was 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( starting value 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and placebo + 2.8 % ( starting value 5,@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .

at chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ies , the exc@@ essive trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , 81 % of patients showed no vom@@ iting in the 24 hours after receiving chemotherapy ( 153 of 189 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) .
for a comparison with d@@ ag@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for al@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
March 2005 , the European Commission announced the company of Helsinki Bi@@ rex Pharmaceuticals Ltd . , a approval for the market placing of Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union .
Alo@@ xi is inde@@ xed : for prevention of acute nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting in strongly em@@ eto@@ gen@@ ic chemotherapy due to cancer disease and vom@@ iting in moderate chemotherapy due to cancer disease .
the efficacy of al@@ xi for prevention of nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , which is produced by a highly significant chemotherapy alone , can be strengthened by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ ic chemotherapy .
da Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the col@@ o@@ dar@@ k@@ age should be monitored by an@@ am@@ nesty Ob@@ jec@@ ation or An@@ mark of a Sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us following injection .
as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 @-@ ant@@ agon@@ ists however , cau@@ tion is recommended for the benefit of pall@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with drugs which pro@@ long the Q@@ T intervals or in patients where the Q@@ T@@ - interval is pro@@ long or which tend to an extension .
except in connection with another chemical agents , al@@ xi shall neither be used to treat nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting in the days after receiving chemotherapy .
in pre@@ clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not affect the activity of the five studied chem@@ o@@ therapeu@@ tics ( cis@@ plat@@ in , Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , Cy@@ clo@@ ab@@ ine , D@@ ox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ yc@@ in C ) .
a clinical study showed no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic interaction between one @-@ time intraven@@ ous dose of palm @-@ os@@ et@@ ron and a ste@@ ady m@@ oc@@ lo@@ pr@@ am@@ ids , a CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors .
in one of a population based pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ et@@ etic analysis , Chlor@@ et@@ id@@ ine , c@@ ann@@ ot@@ ine , r@@ ent@@ an@@ ox@@ in , an@@ op@@ eri@@ od , r@@ it@@ eri@@ do@@ l , an@@ it@@ ab@@ id@@ l , r@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , ser@@ tr@@ al@@ ine and Ter@@ b@@ af@@ in ) had no significant impact on cle@@ aring of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experience for application of pall@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ an@@ cies lie not before , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be applied during pregnant women , unless it is necessary to be used from the treated doctor .
in clinical trials , the most common adverse events were observed with a dose of 250 micro@@ grams ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , at least al@@ lied with al@@ xi in connection , head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and Ob@@ jec@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of survival actions and reactions in the administration site ( burning , har@@ dening , complaints and pain ) have been reported in post @-@ marketing experience .
in the group with the highest dosage , similar number of adverse events were similar to the other dosing groups ; there were no dose @-@ effective relations .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were carried out due to the large distribution volume is a di@@ aly@@ sis but probably not effective therapy with a Alo@@ xi@@ - su@@ do@@ ation .
in two randomised double @-@ blind studies , 1,@@ 132 mg / m2 Cis@@ plat@@ in , car@@ b@@ op@@ lat@@ in , ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 of cy@@ tom@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ time 4 hours ) or 100 mg of Dol@@ ass@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ time 7.3 hours ) received intraven@@ ously to Day 1 without a dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one intraven@@ ously .
in a random@@ ized double @-@ blind study , 667 patients were randomised to ≥ 60 mg / m2@@ cis@@ plat@@ in , with patients compared to which 32 mg of On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron received the 32 mg of On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron that have been administered to Day 1 .
results of studies with moderate chemotherapy and the study of strongly em@@ eto@@ gen@@ ic chemotherapy are summar@@ ised in the following tables .
in clinical studies for the indication of chemotherapy induced nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were comparable to blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the corresponding effects of On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
after the findings of the clinical research , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the in@@ vent@@ ri@@ cular de@@ - and Rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation involved in its power channels and extend the duration of the shareholder potential .
the aim of the study carried out at 221 healthy volunteers were the assessment of EC@@ G @-@ effects of an acute pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.25 , 0,@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
Res@@ or@@ ption According to intraven@@ ous gift to a initi@@ ating decline of plasma concentrations have a slow elimination of body with an average initial half @-@ time period of about 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the area under the concentration process ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally distributed in the entire dose range from 0.@@ 3- 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients .
following an intraven@@ ous gift of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0,25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses of 11 Ho@@ den@@ car@@ cin@@ oma patients measured between day 1 and day 5 measured mean ( ± SD ) increase in Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration at 42 ± 34 % .
pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic sim@@ ulations shows that once a daily intraven@@ ous administration of 0.25 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron reached total value of 0.25 mg of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in 3 consecutive days ; however , the C@@ max reached a value of 0.75 mg higher .
about 40 % are eliminated to the kidneys and about another 50 % are converted into two primary metabol@@ ites that have less than 1 % of ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor .
in @-@ vitro studies for metabol@@ isation have shown that CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 inhibit@@ ing diseases are involved in the metabolism of palm @-@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elimination of a intraven@@ ous dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were found approximately 80 % of the dose within 144 hours of urine , palm @-@ os@@ et@@ ron as un@@ changeable drug made about 40 % of the given dose .
following a single intraven@@ ous bol@@ ting injection in healthy , the total body of the body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al cle@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
although in patients with severe liver function , the terminal reduction of Eli@@ min@@ os@@ et@@ ron are increased , but the average system@@ ic exposition with pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron increases , however , a reduction of the dose is not justified .
in clinical trials , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions that are considered adequate over the maximum of human exposure exposure , which indicates a low relev@@ ance for clinical use .
10 . clinical studies showed that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can be blo@@ cked only in very high concentrations of iri@@ dium channels , which can be involved in vent@@ ri@@ cular de@@ - and Rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and extend the duration of action .
high doses of palm @-@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose were given in some 30 times of therapeutic exposure to humans ) , which resulted in a multiple frequency of liver tum@@ ors , end@@ ocr@@ ine Ne@@ op@@ las@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid , p@@ itu@@ itary , pan@@ cre@@ as , tri@@ ni@@ er@@ en@@ mark ) and skin tum@@ ors with rats , but not in mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not completely unknown , but due to the used high doses and when Alo@@ xi used for a unique application , the relev@@ ance of this results are evaluated as for men minor .

in June 2006 , the Committee for Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative approval in which the pro@@ hibit@@ ing of hepatitis C &apos;s authorisation provided for the treatment of Alp@@ he@@ on 6 million IE / ml In@@ jection solution was recommended .
this means that Alp@@ he@@ on an organic medic@@ inal medicines called Ro@@ feron @-@ A with the same medicine name of Ro@@ feron @-@ A , which should already be similar in the EU ( also called &quot; reference laboratory &quot; ) .
Alp@@ he@@ on should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic ( long an@@ tigen ) hepatitis C ( one by virus infection ) .
in a micro@@ scop@@ ic investigation , the liver tissue damage indicates that are the values of the liver enzymes Al@@ an@@ in@@ - Amin@@ ot@@ ran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) in the blood .
it is produced by a yeast into which a gene ( DNA ) was added to the formation of the active ingre@@ dient .
the manufacturers of Alp@@ he@@ on submitted data , on the comparison of Alp@@ he@@ on with Ro@@ feron @-@ A ( active structure , composition , and purity of medicines , effects , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) .
in the study of patients with hepatitis C , the efficacy of Alp@@ he@@ on was compared to the efficacy of the reference to 455 patients .
the study measured as many patients after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks as well as 6 months after the treatment of the medicine ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int h@@ tt@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © EMEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this Document which we have set the CH@@ MP recommendation for placing on the market .
furthermore , concerns are not ex@@ pressing that data on the stability of the substance and the drug was not sufficient .
the number of patients with hepatitis C which rel@@ ate to the treatment with Alp@@ he@@ on and Ro@@ feron @-@ A , was similar in clinical study .
after adjusting the treatment with Alp@@ he@@ on fire the disease was up@@ set again in more patients than at the reference agent ; Moreover , Alp@@ he@@ on had more side effects .
apart from this study the drug was used to examine the question , to what extent the medicine forms an immune response ( i.e. the bodies ) anti@@ bodies - special proteins - against the medicine ) , not sufficient .
it can be used for the treatment of Imp@@ et@@ igo ( one with cru@@ den@@ ial of skin infection ) and small in@@ ted la@@ xis ( R@@ iss@@ - or chi@@ ves ) , di@@ ced and ste@@ ered wo@@ unds .
Al@@ lo@@ go is not to be used to treat infections , which causes det@@ ec@@ table or presumably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( M@@ RSA ) , because al@@ go does not affect this kind of infections .
Al@@ lo@@ go can be applied for patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under 18 years the skin surface must not exceed 2 % of the body surface .
if the patient does not respond to treatment after two to three days , the physician should examine the patient once again , and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking of bacterial Ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cells in which proteins are produced ) and in@@ hib@@ its the growth of the bacteria .
main indic@@ ative of efficacy was in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection had dropped after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of the 139 patients under Al@@ clo@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of the 71 patients were placebo before placebo .
in the treatment of infected skin friends Al@@ clo@@ ak and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in similar response rates : when the results of both studies were assembled in skin circles , about 90 % of the patients both groups are on treatment .
however , in these two studies , however , Al@@ tar@@ go has been identified during the treatment of crash ( tail @-@ filled cav@@ ities in the body tissue ) or of infections , which have been proven or presumably caused by M@@ RSA , not effective .
the most common adverse events with Al@@ lo@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is an irrit@@ ation of the contractor .
at the conclusion , the Committee for Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Al@@ clo@@ go against the short @-@ time treatment of the following super@@ ficial skin infections : • Imp@@ et@@ igo , • infected small in@@ fir@@ ings , turns , or wh@@ ist@@ erous wo@@ unds .
may 2007 , the European Commission announced the company Gla@@ xo Group Ltd . , a approval for placing on the market of Al@@ lo@@ go into the entire European Union .
patients who shows no improvement within two to three days should be investigated again and an alternative therapy can be considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
in case of a Sen@@ si@@ bil@@ isation or heavy local irrit@@ ation by the application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin oint@@ ment , the treatment is ab@@ orted carefully and an appropriate alternative treatment of infection has been started .
ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be applied to treat infections , which M@@ RSA is known as the path@@ ogen , or assumed ( see section 5.1 ) .
clinical studies in secondary @-@ infected open @-@ wo@@ unds was the efficacy of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections , caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( M@@ RSA ) .
an alternative therapy is to be considered for a 2- or 3 @-@ day treatment no improvement or deteri@@ oration of the infected area .
the impact of simultaneous use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical funds in the same skin surface has not been investigated and the simultaneous application of other top@@ ographic drugs is not recommended .
because of low plasma concentrations , which have been achieved when people were obtained after top@@ ical application in the destro@@ ying skin or infected area , a clinical @-@ relevant inhibit@@ or in vi@@ vo has not been expected ( see section 5.2 ) .
3 After the simultaneous gift of 2 times a day , 200 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole increased the medium ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max after top@@ ical application of 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin . healthy adult men increased by 81 % .
as a result of the low system exposure to top@@ ical application in patients , dose @-@ adap@@ t@@ ulin is not applied to treat , when top@@ ical ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is applied during a systematic treatment with CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a re@@ productive tox@@ icity after intake and are in@@ sufficient to affect the birth and the red@@ ale / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should only be applied during pregnancy , when an top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly inde@@ xed and the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin to avoid an system@@ ic anti@@ bi@@ otic treatment .
in the decision whether the breast@@ feeding is continued / end or end the therapy with Al@@ lo@@ go is supposed to be completed between the benefit of a n@@ urs@@ ing for the mamm@@ ling and the use of the Al@@ lo@@ go therapy to the woman .
in clinical studies of 2@@ 150 patients with super@@ ficial skin infections , Al@@ clo@@ ak was applied , the most frequently reported side effects of Ir@@ rit@@ ation was reported to about 1 % of patients .
effects ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ atives of P@@ and@@ rom@@ util@@ ine , a substance that is isolated by fermentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ ilus pas@@ se@@ ck@@ eri@@ anus ) ( formerly Ple@@ a ot@@ us pas@@ se@@ ck@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the effect mechanism of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on the sel@@ ective inhibit@@ ing of bacterial protein synthesis on a particular binding centre of the 50s of bacterial Ri@@ bos@@ omes , which differs from the ties of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicate that the bin@@ of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ atic protein L3 is involved and in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P bin@@ ing center and the Pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ transferred centre .
by linking to this bin@@ ing centre , P@@ and@@ rom@@ util@@ ine hem@@ or@@ d@@ yl@@ len@@ ine , blo@@ cked partially P @-@ binding inter@@ actions and prevent the normal education of active 50s ri@@ bos@@ omes sub @-@ units .
due to the local preval@@ ence of resistance to ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin , the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should appear at least some infection @-@ forms , it should be as@@ pi@@ red by experts .
no differences in in @-@ vitro activity of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin was found towards S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , ir@@ respective of whether the isol@@ ates are sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in the case of in@@ appe@@ aling to the treatment of S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tribes generated with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( like PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
res@@ or@@ ption in a study of healthy adults was raised 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at oc@@ clu@@ sion daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion and on sh@@ immer@@ sive skin for up to 7 days .
of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , the 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ be obtained twice daily for 5 days for top@@ ical treatment of secondary trau@@ mat@@ h , single plasma samples were obtained .
sampling was carried out on days 3 or 4 in adult patients each before the medication and children between 0 and 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual system@@ ic intake of man according to top@@ ical application of 1 % Sal@@ be increased to 200 cm2 ( C@@ max = 22 n@@ g / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 n@@ g / ml ) 660 times lower than the ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP inhibit@@ ing .

Am@@ bi@@ rix is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B diseases ( liver disease ) in children aged between one and 15 years , which are still not immune to these two diseases .
Am@@ bi@@ rix is used within a framework of two of the vacc@@ inations that requires a protection against hepatitis B which will possibly be reached after administration of the second dose .
for this reason , Am@@ bi@@ rix may only be used when immun@@ isation is a low risk of hepatitis B infection and ensured that the vacc@@ ination of two doses can be brought to an end .
if a collection dose is requested against hepatitis A or B , Am@@ bi@@ rix or other hepatitis B or B vaccine can be given .
&quot; &quot; &quot; vacc@@ ines may work together by bringing the immune system ( the natural movement of the body ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how it can defend against sick@@ ness . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after one child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognizes the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strange &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and creates anti@@ bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Am@@ bi@@ rix contains the same components as the Twin@@ rix adult vaccine since 1996 , and the vacc@@ ination of Twin@@ rix Kids since 1997 .
the three vacc@@ ines are applied to protection against the same disease , but Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are given in the framework of one of three doses of the vacc@@ ination .
because Am@@ bi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adult identical ingredients , some of the data that supports the application of Twin@@ rix adults , also used as a cover for the application of Am@@ bi@@ rix .
the main indicator for the efficacy was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a month after the last injection a protective antibody .
in an additional study of 208 children , the effectiveness of the vaccine was compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 month distance between the two inj@@ ections .
Am@@ bi@@ rix led between 98 and 100 % of the vacc@@ inated children a month after the latest injection to develop anti @-@ violence against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Am@@ bi@@ rix was similar at a six @-@ month distance between the inj@@ ections .
the most common adverse events of Am@@ bi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses ) are head@@ aches , appet@@ ite , pain on the injection point , red@@ ness , fatigue ) and irrit@@ ability .
Am@@ bi@@ rix may not react to patients who are possibly sensitive to active substances , one of the other components or Ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( an anti@@ bi@@ otic ) .
in August 2002 , the European Commission announced the company Gla@@ x@@ o@@ Smith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ olog@@ om@@ s.@@ a. a approval for the placing of Am@@ bi@@ rix in the entire
the standardi@@ zation diagram with Am@@ bi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ inations , whereby the first dose is scheduled for the election and the second dose between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a collection is imp@@ lic@@ ated in hepatitis A as well as for hepatitis B , vacc@@ ines may be vacc@@ inated with the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ous vacc@@ ines or with a combined vaccine .
the anti @-@ hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen with the combination of anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) anti@@ bodies are in the same magn@@ itude like the vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
it is not completely secured , whether immune competent people , which are demanded on an Hepatitis A@@ - imp@@ lied vaccine , as they are also protected by immun@@ ologic memory due to immun@@ ological memory .
3 As with all inj@@ ectors , for the rare case of an an@@ aph@@ yl@@ actic reaction should always be available immediately after the gift of vacc@@ ination against medical treatment and monitoring .
if a quick protection against hepatitis B is recommended , the standardi@@ mp@@ f@@ sch@@ ema is recommended with the combination simple , which contains 360 ELISA @-@ units form@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg of combined hepatitis B surface .
in hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the immune system , there is no adequate anti @-@ HAV@@ ER and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibody in circumstances so that other vaccine doses can be needed in these cases .
as an intra@@ der@@ mal injection or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration in the glut@@ eal muscles can lead to a sub@@ optimal effect of imp@@ lication , this injection can be avoided .
however , in these cases , Am@@ bi@@ rix can be inj@@ ected as an exception sub@@ cut@@ aneous in these cases , since it can occur in these cases after in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration .
when Am@@ bi@@ rix was administered in the form of a separate inj@@ ections at the same time with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ or , tet@@ ra@@ oph@@ ilus influenza vaccine , the immune response was sufficient to all anti@@ gens ( see section 5.1 ) .
patients with immun@@ oh@@ res@@ sive therapy or patients with immun@@ o defects must be assumed that possibly no adequate response should be achieved .
in a clinical study that was conducted with 3 vacc@@ inations of this formulation , the frequency of pain , red@@ ness , sw@@ elling , gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ itis , head@@ ache and fever comparable with the frequency given at the previous Thi@@ omer@@ sal@@ - and preserv@@ ative vaccine form@@ ulations .
in clinical studies , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ inations of Am@@ bi@@ rix was administered in a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ inations ranging from 1 to 15 years .
in a study with 300 participants at the age of 12 and including 15 years the toler@@ ability of Am@@ bi@@ rix was compared to the 3 @-@ cans output vaccine .
only excep@@ tions were the higher Frequ@@ encies of pain and Mat@@ ern@@ ity on a calculation base per vacc@@ ination . Am@@ bi@@ rix , but not on a calculation base per person .
pain was observed according to the gift of Am@@ bi@@ rix at 5@@ 0.7 % of the subjects , compared with 3@@ 9.1 % in subjects , after the gift of a dose of the 3 @-@ cans combination .
according to the complete vacc@@ ination cycle 6@@ 6.4 % of subjects were given to Am@@ bi@@ rix , about pain , compared with 6@@ 3,8 % of the subjects that had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
however , the frequency of Mat@@ ern@@ ity was comparable twice per pro@@ band ( i.e. over the entire vacc@@ ination cycle at 3@@ 9.6 % of the subjects that received Am@@ bi@@ rix , compared with 3@@ 6.2 % of the subjects that received the 3 @-@ cans combination vaccine ) .
the incidence of pronoun@@ ced pain and matter was minor and similar to the administration of the combined manner with the 3 @-@ cans of vacc@@ ination .
in a comparative study of 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds , the appearance of local inter@@ actions and general actions in the Am@@ bi@@ ri@@ x@@ group was comparable to administration with the 3 @-@ doses of form@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg of combined hepatitis B surface .
however , with 6- to 11 years old , however , after vacc@@ ination with Am@@ bi@@ rix a common occurr@@ ence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per speaker , reports .
the share of vacc@@ ines which resulted in severe adverse events during the 2 @-@ cans of vacc@@ ination with 360 EL@@ ISA@@ - Units form@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A Virus and 10 µg re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B@@ - Surface an@@ tigen , was statistically not different .
in clinical studies that were carried out in vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 and including 15 years , the ser@@ op@@ sy rates for anti @-@ H@@ AV 9@@ 9.1 % had a month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second , month 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
the ser@@ op@@ o@@ ic rates for anti @-@ H@@ BS were 7@@ 4.2 % one month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second , month 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a comparative study carried out in 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 have received two doses of Am@@ bi@@ rix and 147 the standard combined fuel with three doses .
in the 289 people whose immun@@ ity rates were identified ( SP in the table below ) against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 were significantly higher than with Am@@ bi@@ rix .
the immune response , which were obtained in a clinical comparative study of 1 @-@ 11 year @-@ olds a month after the full vacc@@ ination series ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table .
in both studies , the vacc@@ ines received either a 2 @-@ doses vacc@@ ination with Am@@ bi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ cans of vacc@@ ination with 360 ELISA @-@ units form@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10@@ µg re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
for persons who were at the time of Grun@@ ew@@ mun@@ ization between 12 and 15 years of age , the Per@@ sist@@ ence of anti @-@ HAV@@ ER and anti @-@ H@@ BS anti@@ bodies could be detected more than 24 months after immun@@ isation with Am@@ bi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 month vacc@@ ination .
the immune reaction of both anti@@ gens was comparable to both anti@@ gens which was detected after vacc@@ ination of 3 doses with a combination of hepatitis C and 10 µg of combined hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study of 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ HAV@@ ER and anti @-@ H@@ BS anti@@ bodies are comparable to immun@@ isation in 0 @-@ 6 months of vacc@@ ination .
when the first dose of Am@@ bi@@ rix starts in the second year at the same time with the imp@@ lic@@ itation of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ or , tet@@ ro@@ oph@@ ilus influenza vacc@@ ines ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or the first dose of a combined mas@@ e m@@ umps R@@ öt@@ tle vaccine was administered . the immune response was sufficient to all anti@@ gens .
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the present formulation in adults , showed the present formulation of similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection and ser@@ op@@ o@@ ic rates as for previous formulation .

as with all vacc@@ ines , Am@@ bi@@ rix can not be protected from an infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus , even if the complete vacc@@ ination series was completed with 2 doses .
if you have already been infected with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus in front of the administration of both vacc@@ inations that have not been infected with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus ( even though you feel un@@ comfortable or sick at the time of vacc@@ ination , may not prevent any vacc@@ ination .

an allergic reaction can express through ju@@ ck@@ ering skin supplements , breathing problems or sw@@ elling or tongue . • If you have an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B if you have a severe infection with fever .
• If you want to have a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and prior to the administration of the second vacc@@ ination ) .
at a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will give you / your child from a vacc@@ ination with Am@@ bi@@ rix Dis@@ gu@@ essing .
instead , he will recommend you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced salary of effective hepatitis C virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a recur@@ ring hepatitis B surface anti@@ gens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the second vacc@@ ines of this vaccine is usually given a month after the first dose and should give you a vacc@@ ination protection before termination of the vacc@@ ination series . &quot; &quot; &quot;

however , it can be that in this case the immune response is in@@ sufficient for the vaccine and the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine is simultaneously given to Am@@ bi@@ rix , should be vacc@@ inated with separate places and as possible various li@@ mb@@ s .
if am@@ bi@@ rix are given at the same time or shortly before or after injection of Im@@ m@@ ung@@ ra@@ is@@ ins , it is probably that the response to the vaccine is still sufficient .
generally Am@@ bi@@ rix pregnant or l@@ act@@ ating women not administered , except it is ur@@ gent necessary that they vacc@@ inated both against hepatitis A and hepatitis B .
important information on certain other ingredients of Am@@ bi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you have shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( anti@@ bi@@ otic ) .
if you miss the agreed appointment for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and make an appointment as soon as possible .

Am@@ bi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and packs to 50 without need@@ les .
based on data , which has become known since the approval of the first approval for placing on the market , CH@@ MP has been positive that the benefits for Am@@ bi@@ rix has been positive .
however , Am@@ bi@@ rix was only introduced in a Member State ( the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this medication is limited to low patient exposure .
am@@ per@@ missions can also be used in patients at the age of more than a month with a full @-@ completed enzyme ( Hir@@ n@@ ought due to high am@@ mon@@ ium concentration ) in the pre@@ history .
am@@ per@@ - - split by several single doses at meals - swal@@ lowed up , mixed under the diet , or via a gast@@ ro@@ om@@ ic acid ( through the stomach @-@ leading hose ) or a Nas@@ ens@@ onde ( through the nose into the corn@@ erst@@ one @-@ leading hose ) .

at the end , the Committee for Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that am@@ mon@@ iers were effectively preventing high am@@ mon@@ ohydr@@ ates in patients with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the ur@@ inary cycle .
under &quot; extraordinary circumstances , the children of Ammon was approved , because due to the rarity of the disease at the time of approval only limited information on this medicine templates .
the use is inde@@ xed to all patients with a complete enzyme already in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
in patients with late mani@@ fold form ( in@@ complete enzyme that is manifested according to the first life of life ) , there is an indication for the use when in the an@@ am@@ ity of a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ astic em@@ missible spongiform encephalopath@@ y .
for infants , for children who are not able to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with hat@@ ch disorders , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS will also be available in granite .
the daily dose is individually calculated under consideration of the protein toler@@ ance and for the development and development of necessary daily protein intake of the patient .
according to previous clinical experiences the normal daily dose of sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as with children growing and adults .
in patients who suffer from an early mani@@ fold defic@@ iency of Car@@ b@@ am@@ yl@@ phosph@@ at@@ rice or Or@@ ni@@ thin@@ scar@@ scar@@ ce , is required sub@@ stitution of cit@@ der@@ lin or ar@@ in@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
patients with a arg@@ in@@ ine @-@ synthetic defic@@ iency need ar@@ in@@ ine in a dosage of 0.4 to 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15,@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets are not given to patients with hat@@ ch disorders , as a risk for the emergence of Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ ag@@ ul@@ cer@@ v@@ zer@@ a exists if the tablets are not immediately reached in the stomach .
every tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , equivalent to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be used in patients with con@@ gest@@ i@@ ver heart failure or severe kidney failure , as well as with sodium injury and eye @-@ up clinical trials only be used with cau@@ tion .
because Met@@ abol@@ isation and precip@@ itation of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat concerning the liver and the kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should be used in patients with liver or kidney failure .
the importance of these results in terms of pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore con@@ tra @-@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate on young rats at high dosage ( 190 - 474 mg / kg ) , a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal prolifer@@ ation and increased loss of neur@@ ons .
it also found a delayed matur@@ ation of cer@@ eb@@ r@@ als syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of working neur@@ ons in the brain and thus a disability in brain growth .
it could not be found if phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate is eliminated from the breast milk and the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during a n@@ urs@@ ing time ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , 56 % of patients showed at least an un@@ wanted event ( AE ) and at 78 % of these undes@@ ired events were assumed that they were not connected with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , commonly ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year old ano@@ re@@ tic patient , who developed a metab@@ olic drug in combination with l@@ act@@ ite outlet , heavy hypo@@ cal@@ an@@ emia , arm@@ ist@@ ochem@@ istry , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ y and pan@@ cre@@ at@@ itis .
a case of an over@@ dose occurred with a 5 @-@ month small child with an outstanding single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms pass with the accum@@ ulation of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate , which showed a dos@@ si@@ ze@@ able neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity with an intraven@@ ous administration of up to 400 mg / kg / day .
Phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate is a metab@@ olic active compound that con@@ jug@@ ated to phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with glut@@ amine , that is left over the kidneys .
sto@@ ols saw phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with urea ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ ric at@@ oms ) ; Phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier to the loss of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the ur@@ inary cycle can be assumed that each gram of protein poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat between 0,@@ 12 and 0.15 g of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ yl@@ o@@ amin @-@ nitrogen are produced .
it is of meaning that the diagnosis is early and the treatment started immediately to improve the survival of survival and clinical outcome .
the forecast of the early mani@@ fold form of the disease with initial symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns age was almost always inf@@ am@@ aust , and the disease resulted in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids , or with its hem@@ ic@@ ular anal@@ ogues for death within the first year of life .
due to Hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the exploitation of alternative ways of nitrogen oxide ( sodium hydro@@ chlor@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate ) , prot@@ ein@@ ous food and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ bor@@ row@@ ed ( however within the first month ) diagnostic diseases to 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even during these patients it came with time during many spiritual abilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its .
in patients with late mani@@ fold form of the condition ( including female patients with a hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ yl@@ scar@@ let defic@@ iency ) , which were treated from a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ary en@@ cep@@ halopath@@ y and a prot@@ ein@@ ous diet was treated with a protein reduced rate of 98 % .
already existing neuro@@ logic defic@@ its are hardly reversible in the treatment and some patients can occur at a further deteri@@ oration of the neuro@@ logical state .
it is known that Phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate , which is con@@ jug@@ ated in liver and kidney disease with glut@@ amine , with phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine samples were determined according to an individual dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis as well as repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( not controlled trials ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metabol@@ ites became also examined at cancer patients with intraven@@ ous gift of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate .
after a oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in tablets , 15 minutes after intake increased plasma concentrations from phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat .
in the majority of patients with ur@@ inary bladder disorders or hem@@ mo@@ glo@@ on@@ opath@@ ies ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) , no Phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate was det@@ ec@@ table in plasma on the next morning .
in three of six patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis which is repeated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 20 g / day oral in three single doses ) , the average Phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ at@@ concentrations were treated on the third day five times higher than after the first gifts .
precip@@ itation The medicine will be eliminated within 24 hours to about 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ jug@@ ated product phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ yl@@ o@@ amin .
according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us testing , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in treated with toxic and non @-@ toxic reactions ( examination 24 and 48 h according to oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 2800 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules is taken either for oral ( infants and children that can still swal@@ low not tablets or patients with hat@@ ch disorders ) or via a gast@@ ro@@ om@@ ic acid or a no@@ bl@@ onde .
according to previous clinical experiences the normal daily dose of sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat : • 450 @-@ 600 mg / kg / day with body@@ weight , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as with children growing and adults .
the concentration of ammonia , arg@@ in@@ ine , essential amino acids ( in particular bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um protein in plasma was kept within the normal range .
in patients who suffer from an early mani@@ fold defic@@ iency of Car@@ b@@ am@@ yl@@ phosph@@ at@@ rice or Or@@ ni@@ thin@@ scar@@ scar@@ ce , is required sub@@ stitution of cit@@ der@@ lin or ar@@ in@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5.4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , equivalent to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
when R@@ atten@@ u@@ ate found phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate ( active metabol@@ ite of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) , it came to les@@ ions in the pyramid of brain function .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year old ano@@ re@@ tic patient , who developed a metab@@ olic drug in combination with l@@ act@@ ite outlet , heavy hypo@@ cal@@ an@@ emia , arm@@ ist@@ ochem@@ istry , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ y and pan@@ cre@@ at@@ itis .
sto@@ ols saw phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with urea ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ ric at@@ oms ) ; Phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier to the loss of excess
on the basis of investigations about the separation of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the ur@@ inary cycle can be assumed that can be produced between 0,@@ 12 and 0.15 g Phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine @-@ nitrogen .
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible in the treatment , and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of the neuro@@ logical state may occur .
after a oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in gran@@ ular form , 15 minutes after intake increased plasma concentrations from phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat .
during the duration of durability , the patient can charge the finished product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not over 25 ° C .
for this approach the small measuring spoon contains 0,@@ 95 g , the medium measuring spoon of 2.9 g and the big measuring spoon of 8.6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat .
if a patient needs to receive the drug via a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS will also be dissolved in water ( the sol@@ ub@@ ility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing that they are unable to separate the raw material products after consumption of proteins in the body .
if you have carried out laboratory tests , you need to take the doctor you need to take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as the sodium hydro@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat can influence the results of certain laboratory studies .
when taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ists if you have other medic@@ ations or have recently taken non @-@ pres@@ cription drug .
during the lac@@ tation period , you may not take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , because the medicine could over@@ pass the breast milk and harm your baby .
in rare cases , confusion , head@@ aches , flav@@ ours , dessert , spec@@ ulation and deteri@@ oration of existing neuro@@ log@@ istic states were observed .
when you determine one of these symptoms , you immediately rely on your doctor or with the emergency recording of your hospital for the introduction of a corresponding treatment in connection .

An@@ gi@@ ox is used to treat patients with &quot; acute grain syn@@ dro@@ us &quot; ( ACS , reduced blood supply to heart ) , for example when inst@@ abil@@ ty ang@@ ina ( heart attack with different thickness ) or m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) ( an an@@ om@@ al measurement value for electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) .
when An@@ gi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients who should under@@ go one PCI , a higher dose is administered and the infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this may contribute to patients with Ang@@ ina or cardi@@ ac disease to maintaining a blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS , where the effect of An@@ gi@@ ox in sole treatment or in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( G@@ PI , a different medicines for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) was compared to another antibody treatment ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans ) and a G@@ PI .
during the PCI was often a St@@ ent ( a short tube that remains in the arter@@ ies to prevent a lock ) and they received additional medicines for preventing blood cl@@ ots , such as Ab@@ ci@@ o@@ xim@@ ab and A@@ spir@@ in .
the treatment of ACS was An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without gift of G@@ PI - preventing new events ( deaths , heart failure or Rev@@ as@@ cular@@ isation ) after 30 days or a year as effective as conventional treatment .
in patients receiving one PCI was An@@ gi@@ ox in relation to all indicators as effective as Hep@@ arin , with severe ble@@ eding , with which it was significantly more effective than Hep@@ arin .
an@@ gi@@ ox should not be applied in patients who are possibly super@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine , other brain areas or one of the other ingredients .
there may not be used in patients who recently had a blood pressure , as well as with people with strong blood pressure or heavy kidney problems or a heart attack .
at the conclusion , the Committee for Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that An@@ gi@@ ox is used for the treatment of ACS and during one PCI for an acceptable replacement for Hep@@ arin .
in September 2004 , the European Commission announced the Company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd . approval for the placing of An@@ gi@@ ox in the entire European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute grain syn@@ dro@@ mes ( inst@@ inc@@ ile ang@@ ina / dis@@ - ST @-@ mid@@ ical ) ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) for an emergency handle or when an early intervention is fore@@ seen .
the recommended initial dosage of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with ACS is a intraven@@ ous bol@@ ting of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h .
if a PCI is carried out a PCI , an additional Bol@@ us of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the infusion for the duration of the procedure is increased to 1,@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
according to the PCI , the reduced infusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be resumed for 4 to 12 hours .
immediately prior to the procedure , a feed rate of 0.5 mg / kg should be administered , followed by an infusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention .
the recommended dosage of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous bol@@ ting of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and one of the intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous infusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg of body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
the safety and effectiveness of a sole Bol@@ us gift by An@@ gi@@ ox was not investigated and is not recommended , even if a short PCI procedure is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to under 225 seconds , a second bolt of magn@@ itude of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should be shortened .
to reduce the occurr@@ ence of low ACT values , the re@@ constituted and diluted medic@@ inal products should be thoroughly bl@@ ended and the bolt dosage should be administered intraven@@ ously .
once the ACT is greater than 225 seconds , a further monitoring is not required , provided , the 1,@@ 75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered correctly .
in patients with moderate kidney @-@ functional limitations ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subjected to a PCI ( whether with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in against ACS or not ) , a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used .
if the ACT value is under 225 seconds , a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT repeated 5 minutes after the second bolt .
in patients with moderate kidney compensation , which led to approval in phase II@@ I@@ - PCI @-@ trial ( Re@@ place @-@ 2 ) , the ACT had included 5 minutes after the gift of the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine @-@ Bol@@ us without dose adjustment at average 366 ± 89 seconds .
3 In patients with severe kidney @-@ compensation ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and di@@ aly@@ sis patients , An@@ gi@@ ox con@@ tra @-@ indicated patients ( see below section 4.3 ) .
treatment with An@@ gi@@ ox can be re@@ directed 30 minutes after termination of the intraven@@ ous gift of un@@ fra@@ c@@ tion@@ ated Hep@@ arin or 8 hours after termination of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of a molecular Hep@@ arin .

patients are carefully treated with respect to symptoms and signs of blood disorders , especially when bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans ( see section 4.5 ) .
even if PCI patients appear under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in most ble@@ eding associated with arter@@ ial pun@@ cture , the treatment of a per@@ cut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ar@@ intervention ( PCI ) may occur during treatment in principle .
in patients who are treated war@@ fare and treated with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , a monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International standardi@@ zation ratio ) should be taken into consideration , to ensure that the value following the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine reg@@ ained its level before the treatment .
starting from the knowledge on the mechanisms of action of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( Hep@@ arin , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ ol@@ y@@ tics or Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ g@@ ation@@ em@@ mer ) can be assumed that these effic@@ ien@@ cies will increase the risk of blood .
in case of combination of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in with thy@@ mo@@ cy@@ tom@@ y or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , clinical and biological hem@@ atology parameters are regularly used in any case regularly .
the experimental studies are imp@@ acted in terms of pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , un@@ satisfactory or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .

both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in Group as well as in patients treated with Hep@@ arin , women and patients over 65 years were more common to adverse events than male or younger patients .
severe ble@@ eding were defined according to AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i standards for severe ble@@ eding as described in table 2 .
both light and heavy ble@@ eding occurred in alone significantly less often than in the groups with Hep@@ arin or G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and Bi@@ vali@@ dru@@ din plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a- inhibit@@ or ( see Table 2 ) .
an AC@@ U@@ ITY heavy ble@@ eding was defined as one of the following events : intra@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , hem@@ atology with diameter ≥ 5 g / dl without obvious blood pressure , reproduction due to ble@@ eding , application of blood products to trans@@ fusion .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used for the treatment of adults , adolescents and children over six years with diabetes that require treatment with ins@@ ulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the ab@@ dom@@ inal wall , inj@@ ected upper th@@ igh@@ s or upper arm as a bovine inj@@ ector .
diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough ins@@ ulin to regul@@ ate the glucose level ( sugar ) in the blood , or does not work the ins@@ ulin .
ins@@ ulin @-@ ulin distingu@@ ishes itself very slightly of human@@ kind ulin , and the change means that it acts faster and has a shorter active effect than a short @-@ effective human@@ ist .
A@@ pi@@ dra was used in combination with a slower ins@@ ulin in patients with type 1 diabetes , where the body does not produce ins@@ ulin in two studies with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
in type 2 diabetes , if ins@@ ulin @-@ ins@@ ulin @-@ ins@@ ulin @-@ type diabetes , A@@ pi@@ dra was investigated in a study with 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indicator for the efficacy was the change of the concentration of the substance gly@@ cem@@ ented hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that shows how well the blood sugar is set .
in the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes , a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was diagnosed with ins@@ ulin @-@ l@@ is@@ per compared to six months .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , lowering the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration up to 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra , compared to 0,@@ 30 % in human normal interest ulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra should not be applied in patients who are possibly sensitive to ins@@ ulin @-@ ins@@ ul@@ is@@ in or one of the other constitu@@ ents , or in patients who are already suffering from hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ cem@@ ia .
A@@ pi@@ dra cans may be adapted if it is administered along with a number of other medicines that can be character@@ ised in the blood of glucose levels .
September 2004 announced the European Commission to the company San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ ent@@ is Deutschland GmbH appro@@ ving A@@ pi@@ dra into the entire European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra is either sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the field of ab@@ dom@@ inal ceiling , to apply or sub@@ cut@@ aneous through continuous infusion in the area of ab@@ dom@@ inal bags .
due to the reduced glucose tolerance capacity and di@@ min@@ ished ins@@ ulin delivery , ins@@ ulin needs can be reduced in patients with a limitation of liver function .
each change of effects , the brand ( her@@ e- St@@ eller ) , ins@@ ulin typical ( normal , N@@ PH , z@@ ink@@ et etc . ) , the type of ins@@ ulin ( animal ins@@ ulin ) and / or the production method can draw a change of ins@@ ulin delivery .
3 An in@@ adequate dosage or termination of a treatment , especially in patients with a ins@@ ulin @-@ charge diabetes , can lead to a hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia and a di@@ abet@@ ic k@@ eto@@ ac@@ re ; these states are potentially life threat@@ ening .
changing a patient to another ins@@ ulin type or an ins@@ ulin @-@ in another manufacturer should be charged under str@@ ingent medical supervision and may require a change of dosage .
the time of testing of a hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ cem@@ ia depends on the active profile of the ins@@ ulin delivery and can therefore change during the switch of the treatment schem@@ as .
increase the substances which ampli@@ fy the bl@@ oss@@ om activity , an@@ gi@@ ot@@ ene enzyme , an@@ gi@@ ot@@ ene enzyme , an@@ gi@@ ot@@ ene enzyme , mon@@ o@@ amine oxi@@ di@@ chloride ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or , pent@@ oxi@@ f@@ yl@@ line , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ a , sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ ates and sul@@ fa drugs .

animal experimental studies for re@@ productive tox@@ icity showed no differences between In@@ su@@ c@@ ling@@ is@@ ul@@ is@@ in and Human@@ ins@@ ulin in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , the birth or the post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
it is not known that ins@@ ulin influences into human milk , but generally ins@@ ulin does not occur in the breast milk , nor is res@@ or@@ ated after oral application .

Li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ rophy is missed , to change the injection point within the injection area , an Li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ rophy should appear on the injection point in succession .
severe hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ cem@@ ia with consciousness can be given by in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Glu@@ k@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , which will be treated by a doctor of glucose by a doctor .
after a glucose injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of serious hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ cem@@ ia and to avoid similar episodes .
ins@@ ulin reduces blood sugar levels by stim@@ ulating the peripheral glucose level ( in particular through sk@@ el@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature and fat ) as well as the in@@ hibition of glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that at sub@@ cut@@ aneous Ga@@ et@@ be of ins@@ ulin p@@ is@@ ul@@ is@@ in the efficiency rate is faster and the effects shorter is shorter than at hu@@ - man@@ em regular ins@@ ulin .
in a study involving 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes m@@ US showed ins@@ ulin effects of 0,0@@ 75 to 0.15 e / kg , a proportion of propor@@ tion@@ ate glu@@ ing effect , and at 0.3 E / kg or more a lower proportion of glu@@ ing effect , precisely like human@@ im@@ ulin .
ins@@ ulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has a double so fast working speed , such as normal human human@@ ulin and achieves the complete glu@@ ing effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human@@ ist ulin .
from the data was evident that a comparable post @-@ buffer gly@@ cem@@ ic inspection was achieved in 2 minutes before meal a comparable post@@ p@@ ran@@ cal control , which is given 30 minutes before meal .
