<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR) in which discussed the studies carried out by the Committee on Humanities (CHMP) in order to bring recommendations concerning the application of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need more information about your illness or treatment, please read the packagons (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacists.</seg>
<seg id="3">If you wish to wish further information regarding the recommendations of CHMP, please read scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, and 30 mg tablets, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of hot tabletten (tablets, which dissolve in the mouth) as a solution for injection (1 mg / ml) and as a injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. effective thinking and speaking, hallucinations (hearing or vision); • Bipolar I disorder, psychological illness, alternating the patients manic episodes (periods become abnormal), alternately with periods of normal atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used for the treatment of severe upto heavier episodes and for the prevention of manic episodes in patients who demanded the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is applied to rapid control of disturbance or behavioral disorders, if the oral consumption of the drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">Both diseases can be used to insert or the hot tabletten in patients who prepares blowing of tablets difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who are taking other medicines at the same time, the dose of Abilify should be adapted to the same time.</seg>
<seg id="10">The signal transmission between brain cells are impaired by "neurotransmitter," i.e. chemical substances which enable communication of nerve cells each.</seg>
<seg id="11">Arieprazole probably works especially as "partial agonist" for the receptors for the neurotransmitter Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means Ariiprazole like 5-hydroxytryptamine and dopamine, but in less larger dimensions as the neural rangles to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">As Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder), Arieprazole contributes to normalize the activity of the brain, which will reduce psychotic or manic symptoms and their reoccur.</seg>
<seg id="14">The effectiveness of Abilify to prevent the rents of symptoms, was investigated in three studies by up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of the injection solution was in two studies at 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar disorders that suffered from increased restlessness, over a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abilify was compared to twelve weeks of 347 patients with haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo which had been stabilized on 160 patients where the manic symptoms were stabilized with abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of Abilify Injection solution was compared to 301 patients with bipolar disorder which suffered from increased restlessness, which compared to Lorazepam (another antipsychotonic) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">All studies the change of symptoms of patients with a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">Moreover, the company also led studies to investigate how the body makes the hot tabletten and the solution to take-out (decreases).</seg>
<seg id="20">In both studies with the injection solution patients who received abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9,75 mg or 15 mg, an significantly stronger reduction of the symptoms were increased more unrest than those who received an placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the application for the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify in four of the five short-time studies is more effective than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">The gilify prevented for up to 74 weeks in addition to placebo experienced major episodes in previously treated patients and when it was administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Inilify injections in 10- or 15-mg doses reduced also more effective than placebo symptoms and were similar effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common adverse events of Abilify to take (observed at 1 to 10 of 100) are extrapyramidal disturbances (sovereignty), squad (sovereignty), squad (soaking), fatigue or exhaustion (increased memory production), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnie (sleep disturbances) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">At the conclusion, the Committee for Humanities (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Abandfy in Bipolar I disorder as well as with the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who were mainly manic episodes on the treatment with Ariepitrazole, in contrast to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the committee came to the result that the benefits of injection solution in patients with schizophrenia or patients with manic episodes in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes when an oral therapy is not suitable, compared to the risks involved.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission announced the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe. a approval for the placing on the market of Abilify in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">ABILIFY is responsible for the treatment of moderate to severe episodes of the Bipolar disturbance and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients, the greater part of some manic episodes (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">An increased effectiveness in doses over a daily dose of 15 mg was not detected, although single patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg once daily, irrespective of meals as Monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and Bipolar-I- disturbance in patients ≥ 65 years was not detected.</seg>
<seg id="33">With respect to the greater sensitivity of this patient group, a lower initial dose should be considered in consideration, if clinical factors are justify these factors (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 inductor is reduced from the combination therapy, the Arieprazole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicides is part of psychotic diseases and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after an antipsychotic treatment, also in treatment with Arieprazole (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of epidemiological study demonstrated that in patients with bipolar disorder, no increased Suitdalitis in comparison to other antipsychotica.</seg>
<seg id="37">Arieprazole should be used with caution of patients with well-known cardiovascular disease (mydration, hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure receptors) or hypertension (including acute and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 late clinical studies: in clinical trials, which lasted one year or less, there were occasional reports during the treatment with Arieprazole offence dyskinesis.</seg>
<seg id="39">When patients treated with ABILIFY patients receiving signs and symptoms of a late dyscinesis, should be taken into consideration, to reduce the dose or treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient develops and symptoms developed on a mns, or unclear a fever without having an additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotics must be deposed, including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore Ariiprazole should be used in patients with cramplifes in the anamness or in states that are used with cramplifes in connection with caution.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years old) with Arieprazole in patients associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Arieprazole, an increased risk of death in comparison to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, there were in one of these studies, a study of fixed dosage, a significant relationship between the dosage and the response to unwanted cerebrovascular events in treated with Arias treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases is extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolarem coma or death, was reported in patients who were treated with atypical antipsychotic agents including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no exact risk assessment for hyperglycemia-related events with ABILIFY and other atypical antipsychotic activity-treated patients who allow direct deformations.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipit, polyphanty, polyphagie and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly in regards to deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">A weight gain is generally observed in healthy patients and patients with bipolar Mania due to comorbidity, the application of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is observed, or an unhealthy life abduction and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effect of Ariiprarazole on the central nervous system, caution when Ariiprazole has been taken in combination with alcohol or other centralized properties including sedation (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2 antagonist Famotidin, a gastric acid blocker, reduced the response rate of Arieprazole, but this effect is not relevant as clinically irrelevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study involving healthy volunteers, a high-effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidin) remained the AUC of Ariipsprorazole 107%, while the Cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected to expect other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as flux in and paroxetin, similar effects and therefore ought to be made similar canned products.</seg>
<seg id="52">CYP2D6 'bad' (= "Poor") Metabolism can result the common use of high-effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 in higher plasma concentrations compared to CYP2D6 extensively.</seg>
<seg id="53">If you consider the common gift of ketoconazole or other high-effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY, the potential benefits should potentially weigh the potential risks for patients.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV proteasant inhibitors, could have similar effects and therefore ought to be made similar canned products.</seg>
<seg id="55">After setting the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitors the dose of ABILIFY should be increased to the Dosage before beginning of the companion therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diluazem or Escitalopram (or escitalopram) or CYP2D6 can be administered jointly with ABILIFY, a moderate increase of the Ariiprazol- concentration can be calculated.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical studies showed doses of 10-30 mg Ariiprachloride per day no significant effect on metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (Dextromethorphan-ratio), 2C19 (Warfaraway) and 3A4 (dextromethorphan).</seg>
<seg id="58">The patients should fail to inform their doctor if they are pregnant or pregnancy during the treatment with Arieprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">Due to the inadequate data situation in humans and due to the reproductive studies in the animal, this medicinal products may not be applied in the pregnancy, unless the benefits justifies the potential risk for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, even with other antipsychotics should be warned against those patients, including motor vehicles, to use until they are sure that Ariipasrazole has no negative influence on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following adverse events were more frequent (≥ 1 / 100) as under Placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of the adverse reactions below are defined in accordance with the following criteria: frequently (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study of 52 weeks in patients who were treated with Arieprazole, a total lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS including Parkinsonism, Akathisie, Dystonie and Dyninsistence, compared to patients who were treated with haloperidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled study of more than 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% was diagnosed with epipylbenzene treatment and 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14,8% was treated with Arieprazole and 15.1% in patients under Olanzapin therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes at Bipolar-I disturbance - In a controlled study of 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 23,5% was diagnosed with patients under Ariiprazol- treatment and 53.3% in patients with half-operidol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study conducted more than 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26.6% was diagnosed with epipylbenzene treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term study period over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS 18,2% was diagnosed with epiprazol- treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups using Arieprazole and placebo in which potentially clinically significant changes of the routinely controlled laboratory parameters found no medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Increase of the CPK (creatine phosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomy, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Arieprazole patients compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">To the side effects, which can occur in connection with an antipsychotic syndrome, malignant neuroleptitic syndrome, late-cerebrovasthma symptoms and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the market launch, irrelevant or clear acute retinal claims were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although there are no information about the effectiveness of a hemoglysis treatment with Arieprazole; however, it is unlikely that Hemodialysis in the treatment of an overdose of benefits, as Ariipraki shows a high plasma monitoring.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the efficacy of Arieprazole in schizophrenia and Bipolar-I disorder on the combination of a partial active effect on Dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1a- receptors and a antagonistic effect on serotonine 5HT2a receptors is mediated.</seg>
<seg id="75">Arieprazole demonstrated in vitro a high affinity to Dopamine D2- and 5HT2a receptor as well as a moderate affinity to Dopamine D4, to the serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, for alpha-1 image and to the histamine-H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">In gift of Arieprazole in doses of 0.5 to 30 mg once a day over 2 weeks of healthy volunteers the posal-dependent tomography showed a dosisoning of 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptors, at Nucleus caudus and at the turret.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-time studies (4 to 6 weeks) patients with positive or negative symptoms showed on placebo in comparison to placebo a statistically significant improvement in psychotic symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="78">In one half-controlled study, 52% of the response of the response of response in both groups were similar to study medication, both groups (Ariiprachloride 77% and haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values from measured values were defined as secondary study potential, including PANSS and Montgomery-Asberg- Depressions scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement in Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study of more than 26 weeks in stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, a significantly higher reduction in response rate, with 34% in the arithmeta group and 57% below placebo was placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In a Oldapin-controlled, multinational double-blind study in schizophrenia (N = 18 or 13% of balanced patients), in significantly fewer patients showed a weight gain of at least 7% compared with an average weight of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of approx. 5.6 kg.</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled Monotherapy studies with more flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the Bipolar-I disorder, Arieprazole showed an increase in contrast to placebo over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled Monotherapy study of 3 weeks with a fixed dosage of patients with a manic or mixed episode of the Bipolar-I disorder, Arieprazole showed no excessive effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo and active control studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a Bipolar I disturbance, with or without psychotic features, Ariipsprorazole showed an effect towards placebo over a week 3 and a refreshed effect that was comparable to lithium or Haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">In addition, Arieprazole proved to have a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of the Mania on how Lithium or Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study about 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a Bipolar-I disturbance, with or without psychotic features, the companion therapy with Ariipraole revealed an overlegenic efficacy in the reduction of manic symptoms compared to Monotherapy with lithium or Valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a long-term expansion phase lasting over 74 weeks in manic patients, Arieprazole had reached a remission compared to placebo in regard to the prevention of a bipolar feedback, predominantly in the prevention of a return in the Mania.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based in vitro-studies the CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes responsible for the expansion and hydroxyylbenzene, the N-Dealkyrie is catalyzes by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean elimination period of Eliasrazole is close to nearly 75 hours for Arieprazole on extensive metabolites via CYP2D6 and nearly 146 hours in 'poor' (= "Poor") Metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Arieprazole, there are no differences in pharmacokinetics of male and female healthy volunteers, likewise showed a pharmacokinetic examination of patients no sexually independent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">No indication on pharmacokinetetics yielded no hint on clinically significant differences in respect to ethnic background or the impact of smoking at the pharmacokinetics of Ariipraole.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetical properties of Ariipraole and dehydro-Ariipolole were similar in patients with heavy kidney failure failure compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study in subjects with different gradient of liver cirrhosis (Child Puga, Class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the impairment of liver function on pharmacokinetetics of class C, which is not enough to drag to their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional clinical studies for safety-harmacology, toxicity in repetitive gift, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and to the canoogenic potential had not made no special hazards for human beings.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicological significant effects were observed only at doses or expositions, which considerably exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans, so they only have limited or no significance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects of the lead-dependent side of doscope with rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (corresponds to between 3-10 mg / kg / day (i.e. 10 times the middle steady-state-state exposition (AUC) during the recommended maximum dose of people).</seg>
<seg id="97">Moreover, a cholelithiasis developed as a result of the tactics of Sulphylbenzene in the gall of monkeys after repeated oral care of between 25 and 125 mg / kg / day (i.e. - to 8 times the recommended maximum dose of people based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, the concentrations found at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg found at concentrations of sulfate - Ariipraole no more than 6% of the concentrations, which were detected in the study above 39 weeks in the gall of monkeys, and far below the limit values (6%) of the Vitality of Vitality.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits these effects were observed according to dosages which led to expositions of the 3- and 11fold of the middle steady-state AUC in the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="749">Summary of the EPAR for the public The document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR) in which discussed the studies carried out by the Committee on Humanities (CHMP) to bring recommendations concerning the application of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="750">Accounts is used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin dependent diabetes), where metformin (a diabetic medication) is not displayed. • It can be used together with another diabetic medication (Dualtherapy).</seg>
<seg id="751">In addition to metformin in patients (in particular, overweight patients) may not be applied with metformin alone in the highest tolerable dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulfa-resin, or insulin at the beginning of the Actos treatment, except in patients with hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar); here should the dose of the sulphur resin or the insulin should be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's own insulin can be utilized better and the blood sugar levels sinks, reducing the type 2 diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of Actos in tripleththerapy was investigated; in addition, patients received a combination of metformin with a sulfyllite, in addition, they received either Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies, the concentration of a substance in blood (glycemylized hemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured, which shows how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="756">Accounts led to a lowering of the HbA1c value, which can be concluded that the blood glucose levels were reduced from 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the Triplea study, the effect of an additional application of Accounts in the existing treatment with metformin and a sulfondyllite in a reduction in HbA1c values by 0,94%, while the addition of placebo contributed to a decrease of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study included in the combination of Actos and insulin in 289 patients, the patients who additionally contributed to insulin, a reduction in HbA1c values of 0.69% after 6 months compared to placebo in addition to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common adverse events related to Actos were tendencies, infections of the upper respiratory infections, weight gain and hypothesia (reduced sensitivity to friction).</seg>
<seg id="760">Accounts may neither be applied in patients who are possibly supersensitive (allergic) compared to Pioglitazone or one of the other components, even in patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetic ketoacidosis (high cholesterol levels - acidity levels - in blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It was decided that Actos were in line with a monotherapy (in sole use) as an alternative to standard treatment with metformin in patients, where metformin is not displayed.</seg>
<seg id="762">In October 2000, the European Commission announced a approval by Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited for placing on the market of Actos in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">The tablets are white to white, round, curved and carry on one side the mark "15" and on the other side the inscription "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazone is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is insufficient and incompatibility with those metformin due to contraindications or incompatibility (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">For the use of Pioglitazone in patients under 18 years of age, no data is available, therefore the application in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients receiving at least one risk factor (e.g. previous heart attack or symptomatic coronary heart disease), a decompensated heart failure should begin to increase the treatment with the lowest available dose and increase dosage.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of cardiac insufficiency, weight gain or estrogen, particularly those with reduced cardial reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be found at signs and symptoms of cardiac insufficiency, weight gain and estry when Pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular study with Pioglitazone in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and preexisting advanced maktionary disease was carried out.</seg>
<seg id="770">In this study, an increase in reports of heart failure, which however did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased output liver enzymes (ALT &gt; 2,5 x upper limit of standard range) or with other signs of liver disease may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT mirrors up to 3 times the upper limit of the standard range, the liver surface values are as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If one patient developed symptoms that point out on an hepatic dysfunction, such as unexpected nausea, vomiting, upper jaw pain, fatigue, appetite and / or darker harn, are the liver enzymes.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision to continue whether the treatment is continued with Pioglitazone should be derived from the clinical evaluation of the clinical evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical studies with Pioglitazone, dossier was detected, which can be stir from fat deposits, and in some cases linked to a fluid flow.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of a hemodilution with Pioglitazone, a marginally reduction in the middle hemicidal binds (relative reduction by 4%) and the hematrits (relative reduction by 4.1%).</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in patients with Pioglitazone in patients under metformin (relative reduction of hemogashbins by 3.6-4.1%) and at a lower degree in patients under sulfonyl bins by 1-2% and hematocrits by 1-3.2%.</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin-insitivity in patients who received Pioglitazone as oral two or triple combination therapy with insulin-based chemotherapy, the risk of dosisite hypoglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the introduction of the market with Thiacolidindian, including Pioglitazone, about an occurrence or deterioration of diabetic macular modems with a decrease of visual acuity was reported.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of Pioglitazone and the occurrence of macular modems, however, if patient must report on disruption of visual acuity; a suitable ophthalmological purification should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summarizing analysis of messages unwanted events from randomised controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with Pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated fretincture incidence came to 1.9 fractures for 100 patients treated with Pioglitazone treated women and 1,1 fractures for women who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the proactive study, a study conducted over 3.5 years for research involving cardiovascular events, stood at 44 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patients) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy, and if a patient does not wish to receive a pregnancy or the entry (see section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies for investigation of interactions have shown that Pioglitazone did not show relevant effects on pharmacokinetetics or pharmaceutical dynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions involving medicines that are metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. oral contracephala, Cyclosporin, Calciumcanalblocker and HMGCoA reducer are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a Cytochrome P450 2C8- inhibitor) resulted in an increase of AUC by Pioglitazone around the 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazone using Rifampicin (a Cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) resulted in a decrease of AUC by Pioglitazone by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to it is due to the treatment with Pioglitazone who reduces hyperinsulinemia and increased insulin resistance of the parent's disease and thereby reducing the availability of metabolic substrates for the reddish growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very common &gt; 1 / 10; frequent &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000; &lt; 1 / 1000; rarely &gt; 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, single cases: unknown (from present data is not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="791">This lead to a temporary variation of the tower and the refractive index of the lens, as well as in other hypoglyricous ingredients are observed.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical studies with Pioglitazone, ALT calls over the three times the upper limit of the standardization frequently occurred precisely as below placebo, but more rarely than in comparative groups under metformin or sulfa drugs.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an outcomes study in patients with preexisting advanced maktionary disease, the frequency of severe cardiac failure was 1.6% higher than placebo when Pioglitazone bzw.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since its market launch, rarely about cardiac insufficiency has been reported, however, if pioglitazone in combination with insulin or patients with cardiac insufficiency has been applied.</seg>
<seg id="795">There was a summarizing analysis of messages unwanted events from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with Pioglitazone treated groups and over 7,400 patients treated with comparative medication groups.</seg>
<seg id="796">In the study conducted over a period of 3.5 years, questionnaire were treated at 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with Pioglitazone treated patients compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="797">When taking the maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, 180 mg / day over seven days have no symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazone seems to work on a activation of specific kernel receptors (Peroxisome Proliferation of Receptor-γ (PPAR-γ)), which leads to an elevated insinsulin-sensitivity of liver, fat and skeleton muscle cells.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitazone can reduce glucose production in the liver and increases peripheral glucose levels in the event of a insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with Pioglitazone versus Glicenzid as Monotherapy has continued over two years to investigate the therapeutic efficacy (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 treatment months).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years after the start of therapy a blood sugar control was determined (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) by Pioglitazone at 69% of treated patients (compared to 50% of patients treated below Gliclazid).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled study about 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was adjusted with insulin-inadequate, to Pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients with Pioglitazone reduced the mean HbA1c - value of 0.45%, compared to the patients who continue to have only insulin one in the group treated with Pioglitazone group.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical studies over a year, under Pioglitazone showed a statistically significant decrease of the album umine / Kreatinin-quotients compared to initial values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of Pioglitazone (Monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was tested in a small, on 18 weeks of the study of type 2 diabetic patients.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical trials, compared to placebo a reduction in plasma triglyceride and the free fatty acids and a rise of HDL- Cholesterinspiegel as well as small but not significantly increased LDL- Cholesterinspiegel.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, Pioglitazone compared to Plazebo, metformin or Gliclazid the overall plasmal glyceride and the free fatty acids and increased the HDL Cholesterinspiegel.</seg>
<seg id="808">Compared to placebo was found no statistically significant increase in LDL Cholesterinspiegel, while metformin and Gliclazid were observed.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study about 20 weeks, Pioglitazone was not only reduced the sober-triglyceride, but also improved triglyceride mirror, this also increased to both a effect on the Triglyceride Absorption and the Triglyceride Absorption.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the proactive study, a cardiovascular study enrolled, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and advanced, advanced, advanced and cardiovascular disease were randomised to either Pioglitazone or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral application, Pioglitazone is quickly resorated, with the peak concentric congestions to unchangeable Pioglitazone in plasma for 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">Based on this basis, the contribution of M-IV contributed to the efficacy in roughly the three times the efficacy of Pioglitazone, whereas the relative effectiveness of M-II is minimally pronounced.</seg>
<seg id="813">In interaction studies, Pioglitazone could not have found a relevant effect on pharmacokinetetics or pharmaceutical dynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (cytochrome P450 2C8 inhibitor) increases or reduces the plasma concentration of Pioglitazone (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">According to oral application of radioactive pioglitazone in humans, the marker was found mainly in barrel (55%) and a lower degree in Harn (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The mean plasma-Eliminating fluid period of unchangeable Pioglitazone is 5-6 hours, and that of the active metabolism is at 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasma concentrations of Pioglitazone and its metabolites are lower than healthy volunteers with reduced kidney function in patients with reduced kidney function, but similar to the oral clearing of the maternity.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys, according to repeated administration of plasma volume with hemogation, anemia and reversible checcentric heart hypertrophic.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to it, that under treatment with Pioglitazone reduces hyperinsulinemia and increased insulin resistance of the parent's disease and thereby reducing the availability of metabolic substrates for fötal growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years) in the grove increased disability from hyperplasia (male and female rats) and tumours (male rats) of the urinary bladder epithelium.</seg>
<seg id="821">In a animal model of the family-like polyposis (FAP), treatment with two other thiazolidindices resulted in increased frequency of colontanors.</seg>
<seg id="822">The tablets are white up to white, round, flat and carry on one side the mark "30" and on the other side the inscription "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="823">The calculated fretincture incidence came to 1.9 fractures for 100 patients treated with Pioglitazone treated women and 1,1 fractures for women who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the proactive study, a study conducted over 3.5 years for research involving cardiovascular events, stood at 44 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patients) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study, the effects of a combination therapy of metformin with Pioglitazone or Gliclazid were examined.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical trials over 1 year showed a statistically significant decrease of the album umin / Kreatinin-quotients compared to initial values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study about 20 weeks, Pioglitazone was not only the sober-triglyceride, but improved beyond the postpranch mirror elevated triglyceride view, this is both on a effect on the Tryglycemic absorption system as well as to the hepylated tryginald synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study was missing the aim of their primary endpoint, which contains a combination of the overall mortality, malonarer Revascularization and Revascularization of the arteries, coronarer Revascularisation and Revascularization of the leg arteries, put the results close to taking Pioglitazone cannot be associated with cardiovascular risk.</seg>
<seg id="829">The tablets are white up to white, round, flat and carry on one side the mark "45" and on the other side the inscription "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="830">In a summarizing analysis of messages unwanted events from randomized, randomised, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years, treated with Pioglitazone, showed a higher incidence of bones in women.</seg>
<seg id="831">In the proactive study, a study conducted over 3.5 years for research involving cardiovascular events, stood at 44 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patients) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="832">In a study about 20 weeks, Pioglitazone was not only the sober-triglyceride, but improved beyond the postpranch mirror elevated triglyceride mirror, this can be seen through a effect on the Triglyceride Absorption and the Triglyceride synthesis as well.</seg>

<seg id="864">Actraphane was given a total of 294 patients with type 1 diabetes, where the pancreas is no insulin, and type 2 diabetes, where the body is not able to use insulin.</seg>
<seg id="865">After 12 weeks the concentration of a substance (glycemented hemoglobin hemoglobin (HbA1c) was measured, which shows how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="866">Actraphane led to a decrease of the HbA1c-mirror, which pointed out that the blood sugar levels were similarly lowered considerably to other human-insulin.</seg>
<seg id="867">Actraphane should not be used in patients to react sensitively (allergic) to humaninsulin (rDNA) or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="868">In addition, doses of Actuphane may be adapted, when it is administered along with a number of other medicines that can be effected on blood sugar (the full list is to be disclosed).</seg>
<seg id="869">At the conclusion, the Committee of Humanities (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Actraphane was in the treatment of diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="870">October 2002, the European Commission announced the Novo Nordisk A / S authorization for placing on the market of Actraphane in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="871">Assmixed insulin products normally be applied once or twice daily, when a fast-initialized effect along with a longer lasting effect.</seg>
<seg id="872">Injection needle must be kept under the skin at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose is injected.</seg>
<seg id="873">Patients whose blood glucose levels significantly improved by an intensive insulin treatment, hypoglycemia hazard can perceive and should be advised accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="874">Any changes to strength, brand (manufacturer), insulin, long-phase (animal insulated), type of insulin (animal insulin, humaninulin or insulated) and / or manufacturing method (by recombinant DNA versus insulin-animal origin) can lead that a change of dosage is required.</seg>
<seg id="875">In case of switch to Actraphane in patients a dose adjustment is required, it may be necessary for the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after conversion.</seg>
<seg id="876">Some patients suffering from hypoglycemic reactions were reported after a change of animal against human insulin, reported that the early warning symptom of a hypoglycaemia were less pronounced or unlike its previous insulin.</seg>
<seg id="877">Prior to travel, which should go over several time zones, the patient should bring it to the advice of his physician, because such journeys can be used, insulin and meals should be applied to other times respectively.</seg>
<seg id="878">The doctor may therefore consider potential interactions in therapy and its patients always ask for others taken by them.</seg>
<seg id="879">4 For hypoglycaemia as well as hyperglycemia, which can occur with a non-sufficiently controlled diabetestherapy, increase the risk of abnormalities and fruit tod in utero.</seg>
<seg id="880">Severe hypoglycics can lead to consciousness and / or cramplifes and lead by temporary or prolonged disturbances of brain function and even death.</seg>

<seg id="885">Illnesses of the immune system - Urania, Exanthem Very seldom - anaphylactic reactions symptoms of generalized skin rash, itching, gastrointestinal disturbances, angioneurial oil, breathing difficulties, lower blood pressure and powerlessness.</seg>
<seg id="886">However, a hypoglycemia is able to develop in stages: • Easily hypoglycemented can be treated by the oral supply of glucose or sugar foods.</seg>
<seg id="887">Diabetics should therefore always have grief, sweets or sugar fruit juice with a intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of Glucagon (0.5 to 1.0 mg) or glucose by glucose or glucose by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="888">Effect starts within half an hour, the active maximum will be reached within 2 to 8 hours and the overall duration of the activity is up to 24 hours.</seg>
<seg id="889">Reorption The Resorption profile is established in it that it is a blend of insulin products with faster or delayed resorption.</seg>
<seg id="890">A range of spades (hydrolyse-) places in the human insulin molecule were moved into consideration; none of the metabolites formed in the split.</seg>

<seg id="1428">Dose customization in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function For maintaining bleaching in the target range can be necessary in patients with severe liver function, a reduction of dose necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced kidney function Da kidney function has no influence on pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus, it can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1430">Due to the nephrotoxic potentials by Tacrolimus, however, a careful monitoring of renal function (including a regular determination of serum increinine mirror, an calculation of creatininine and a monitoring of the urinary volume) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Conversion of Ciclosse on Advagraf In the conversion of a Ciclosse - to a tacrolimus-based therapy is careful (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">Recommendations to the valley level in full blood The dose should be based on the clinical assessment of repulsion and tolerability in single failure of whole blood-tacrolimus-tales-inspections.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended frequent inspections of the tacrolimus talents during the first two weeks after transplantation, followed by periodic inspections during maintenance therapy.</seg>

<seg id="1435">Since Cagraf is a medicine with a low cleance, the dose may need several days until the Steady State has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The data in clinical trials agreed that a successful treatment is possible in most cases when the valley level do not exceed 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice the valley mirror of Tacrolimus lie in full blood in the first time after liver transplants usually in the range from 5 - 20 ng / ml and with kidneys - and heartbeat patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent maintenance of liver, kidney or cardiac transplants were used normally in blood concentrations in the range from 5 to 15 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This resulted in serious adverse events, including transplants or other side effects, which can occur in the result of tacrolimus sub or exposure.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always retain the same tacrolimus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage; provisions of formulation or regime should only be carried out under the dicular control of a doctor's transplantation (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1441">5 In the treatment of adult patients with transplant transplant that proved to be treated with other immunohressants, there are still no clinical data for retardized formulation of the Cagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1442">For prophylaxis of transplant transplant in adult heart transplant and transplant transplants are still no clinical data for the retardized formulation of the Cagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Because of possible interactions, which can lead to a reduction of the tacrolimmer level in blood and a weakening of the clinical effect of tacrolimus (hypericum perforation) included, or other plant healing during a treatment with Advagraf (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhö is a particularly careful monitoring of the tacrolimus- concentration in the blood because the acrolimus blood levels may be subject to adverse variations under such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases, aquatf was considered as a cardiomyopathy called chamber or septum hypertrophy, which can therefore also occur under Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Further factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders, are one of existing heart diseases, a treatment with corosteroids, hypertension, kidney or liver function, infections, liquid-loading and oil.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other immunity stress, the impact of sunlight or UV light should be restricted because of the possible risk of malignant skin changes due to appropriate clothing or use of a solar protection with a high protective factor.</seg>

<seg id="1450">The simultaneous use of medicines or plant remedies that are known as Hemmer or inductors of CYP3A4, can reduce the metabolism of tacrolimus or decrease the blood values of tacrolimus or decrease.</seg>
<seg id="1451">Therefore it is advisable to change the tacrolimus- blood levels in simultaneous use of substances that can change the CYP3A metabolism and to set the acrolimus dose for maintaining the same concentrations (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1452">A highly distinctive interaction was achieved with antimykotika like ketoconazole, fluconazole, iconazole, iconazole and preiconazole, and with the Macrolid antibiotic erythromycin and HIV-protease. (z.</seg>
<seg id="1453">Pharmacokinetikstudies showed that the increase of blood levels mainly from the increased bioavailability of tacrolimus, due to the inhibition of the gastrointestinal failure, results.</seg>
<seg id="1454">High-dose prednisolone or methylprednisolone, as it is used in acute infections, the concentration of tacrolimus can increase or lower.</seg>
<seg id="1455">Tacrolimus is known to the metabolism of other medicines Tacrolimus as CYP3A4 inhibitor; therefore, the simultaneous application of tacrolimus is metabolized by CYP3A4 whose metabolism may affect the metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Since Tacrolimus reduce the cleance of steroid contradiction and thus increase hormone levels, is especially careful with decisions concerning initial measures.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animal experiments have shown that tacrolimus reduce the cleance of pentobarbital and phenazone, and extend their half-time.</seg>
<seg id="1458">The results of a low number of investigations into transplant patients provide no evidence that under Tacrolimus, an increased risk of undesirable events in regard to the course and the result of pregnancy is made.</seg>

<seg id="1467">It was reported about benign or malignant Neoplasms including EBV- associated lymphoproliferative diseases and skin tumors in conjunction with the tacrolimus treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1468">Due to its high molecular weight, its low water solubility and the high binding to Erythrozyten and Plasmaproteine can be assumed that tacrolimus is not dialytic.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Effects of action and the codified effects on the molecular level, the effects of Tacrolimus are mediated through his liaison to a cytosolian protein (FKBP12) which is responsible for enrichment the connection in cell internal cell.</seg>

<seg id="1643">The virus in Advexin is a "Adenovirus" which has been changed so it does not produce any copies of itself and thus cannot trigger any infections in humans.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advomin would have to be injected directly into the tumours and thus enabling the cancer cells to form normal p53-protein.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53-protein that is made out of the non-defectives in the human body existing p53 gene, contributes to the recovery of corrupt DNA and kill the cells when the DNA can not be restored.</seg>
<seg id="1646">At Li-Frauenki-Cancer, the p53-protein is not correct, the p53-protein is not correct, and the cancer cells can grow.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company placed data from a study with a patient, at the Li-Fraumeni-Krebs in the field of construction, in the bones and in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP has examined the answers to the company's questions, still some issues were unexplained.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the review of the initially submitted documents, the CHMP has a list of questions which will be sent to the company.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to the opinion of the CHMP, it was not sufficient that the injection of Advexin in Li-Fraumeni tumours benefits for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The Committee also had further concerns relating to the processing of the medicine in the body, the type of administration as well as the safety of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1652">In addition, the company had not been proven that Advantages can be manufactured in a reliable way that neither to the environment nor for people who come in contact with the patient, is harmful.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company won't be aware of it, whether the withdrawal will have consequences for patients who are currently taking part in clinical trials or "Compassionate Use" programs with Advexin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"modified efficienization" means that the tablets are composed so that one of the effective components have been released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours.</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used to treat the symptoms of seasonal allergy rhinitis (hay fever, through an allergy against pollen pathway inflammation of the nasal paths) in patients with nasal mucosal swelling (stopover nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and adolescents 12 years old, the recommended dose of Aerinaze is twice a tablet that should be taken with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of treatment should be as short as possible and end as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of nasal mucosa (roast nose) are clashed.</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be found on the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The most effective measures were the changes in the severity of the hay fever squatoms that were reported from the patient before the treatment and during 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, patients showed their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and evaluated them with a standard scale, how heavy the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In consideration of all the root symptomsmen, the patients reported the aerinaze had taken over a decrease of symptoms by 46.0%, compared to 35.9% with the patients who died pseudoephedrine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">When only the swelling of nasal mucosa was regarded, the patients showed in aerinaze a reduction of symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% with the patient, the Desloratadine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of Aerinaze (observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are speedycardia (throats), oral malodness, oscillation, headache, fatigue, insomatic (insomnia), mannolence (insomnia), insomnia (smearing), insomnia and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerinaze may not be allergic to desloratadin, pseudoephedrine or one of the other components, against adverge agents or Loratadin (a different medicines for allergies), not used.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerinaze cannot be applied to patients who suffer from an Engage-angle glaucoma (hypertension), hyperthyroosis (hypertension), hyperthyroosis (hypertension), hyperthyreosis (hypertension) or already had an hemorrhagic stroke (caused by a brain injury) or had a risk for a hemorrhagic impact.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission announced a approval for the market placing on the market of Aerinaze to the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, however, if swallow (i.e. without it to crush, break or chewed).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aerinaze should not be used in children under 12 years due to the lack of data concerning the failure and effectiveness (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is so short as possible, and should not be continued after symptoms of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the application duration to 10 days, as long as long-term application the activity of pseudoephedrine can take off.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Following the decline of swelling mucous membranes in the upper respiratory cause, treatment with desloratine can be continued as Monotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Since Aerinaze Pseudoephedrine contains the medicine also indicated in patients who are treated with a monoaminase (MAO) inhibitor and within 2 weeks after completion of such therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to the alphamimetric activity with other vasoconstripped in combination with other vasoconstriamine or other decongestiva, ergotid, ergotid, ergotid, phenylephrin, ephedrine, ephedrine, oxidiolin, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and effectiveness of these combination therapy were not tested and the data are not sufficient to express appropriate recommendations to the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The safety and effectiveness of aerinaze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver function and not sufficient data to express appropriate recommendations for dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients must be informed that treatment in case of hypertension or tachycaresses, heart rhythmias, nausea or any other neurological symptoms (such as headaches or an amplification of headache) must be canceled.</seg>
<seg id="1677">In the treatment of the following patient groups, patients suffering from patients with heart rhythmias patients with hypertension • patients with hypertension • patients with a myocardial infarction in anamnay, diabetes mellitus, bladder or bronze) in the anamness.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze is to be used at least 48 hours before performing dermatological tests as anti-histamine other reactions to indicators to prevent skin reactions or can reduce their degree.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In addition, clinical trials with disinloratine, in which Erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally given, however, no clinically relevant interactions or alterations of the plasma concentration of Desloratine were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The results of the psychological testing was no significant differences between the patients treated with Desloratine and those treated with placebo patients, regardless of whether Desloratine alone or with alcohol was taken.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of desloratadine is not yet identified, so the interactions involving other medicines can not be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadine inhibits in-vivo CYP3A4 and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 is not inhibited and neither a substrate is nor a inhibitor of the P-glycoprotone.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The injustice of the use of aerinaze during pregnancy is not secured, experiences from a large number of affected pregnancies, however, no increase the frequency of abnormalities compared with the frequency in the normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since reproductive studies on animals did not always be transferred to humans and to the reason of vasocontra-sectional properties of pseudoephedrine should not be applied in the pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, patients should be clarified in very rare cases that can be found in very rare cases that can lead to impairment or ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="1686">Symptoms may vary between a CNS depression (sedation, Apnoe, diminished mental attention, cyanosis, Koma, heart-cycle collapse) and a CNS-stimulation (insomnia, hallucinations, treason, convection) with possible tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headache, anxiety, irritation and increased muscle tensions, euphoria, refreshment, nausea, transecrecy, nausea, transcent pain, swings, tinnitus, visual acuity and hypertension or hypotony.</seg>

<seg id="1689">These include both the inhibiting of proinflammatory cytokinen such as IL-4, IL-8, IL-8 and IL-13 as well as the inhibitor of the expression of the inhibiting class P-seless on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">In a single dose trial with adults, Desloratadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement variables of the flight power, including the amplification of subjective and tasks that are connected to the flies.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical studies, the recommended dose of 5 mg. a day has no increased incidence of drowsiness compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The orange application of pseudoephedrine in the recommended dosage may cause additional sympathetic effects, such as an increase in blood pressure, a tachykarst or manifestations of a ZNS replacement.</seg>
<seg id="1693">1,248 patients ranged from 12 to 78 years with seasonal allergitis in rhinitis, with 414 patients suffering from Aerinaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies, histamine-antagonistic effectiveness of aerinaze tablets, determined by the overall grade of symptoms (except for nasal muctival swelling), significantly higher than under a monotherapyhedrin over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The effectiveness of Aerinaze pills with regard to the swelling effect, determined by the nasal mucosal swelling, was significantly higher than under a monotherapist with disinloratadine about the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The effectiveness of Aerinaze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of sex, age or ethnic origin.</seg>
<seg id="1697">As part of a single dose study for pharmacokinetics of aerinaze, Desloratine is detectable within 30 minutes after administration in plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the pertinent application of aerinaze in healthy volunteers more than 14 days the flow of Desloratadin, 3-hydroxydesloratine and Pseudoephedrine was reached in day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">In the framework of a pharmacokinetic multi-doscope study, which was carried out by formulation as tablet to healthy adult persons, was detected that four subjects disinloratadine poorarily bad.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component interact study shows that the exposition (Cmax and AUC) of pseudoephedrin according to the sole gift of pseudoephedrin is organic equivalent to the exposition of an Aerinaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on conventional clinical studies for safety-harmacology, toxicity in retreat, to eradiotoxicity and reproductive toxicity with disinloratine, however, have no special hazards for human beings.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination had no greater toxicity as their single components, and the observed effects were generally consistent with the ingredient Pseudoephedrin.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductive toxicological studies the combination of Loratine / pseudoephedrine was not termed up to 150 mg / kg / day and rabbits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day.</seg>

<seg id="1893">June 2008 Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics S.r.l. was officially appointed to the Committee of Humanities (CHMP) that the company takes on approval for placing Aflunov to prevention of aviaries H5N1 influenza in adults and elderly people.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be used in adults and older people to protect against flu, caused by the trunk (type) H5N1 of influenza A-virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special type of vaccine that could protect from a trunk of influenza, which could cause future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">An influenza pandemic breaks out when a new trunk of flu virus occurred, who can easily distribute man by man because humans have no immunity (no protection).</seg>
<seg id="1897">After administration of the vaccine, the immune system detects the parts of the Grippevirus as "physical-foreign" and forms an antibody.</seg>
<seg id="1898">As a result, the immune system was later able to form a contact with a flu virus of this stem.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Afterwards, the membrane cover of the virus with the "surface antigens" (proteins on membranes that recognize the human body as physical ambush) are separated, cleaned and used as part of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">A inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not conducted in accordance with the "good clinical practice" (GCP).</seg>
<seg id="1901">As a result, the amount of clinical data based on the safety of vaccines did not comply with the requirements of the guidelines of the EMEA for preventive vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="1902">If you need to participate in a clinical trial and require further information regarding your treatment, please contact your treatment doctor.</seg>
<seg id="1903">If you wish to wish further information regarding the recommendations of CHMP, please read scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="1904">In combination with other antiviral medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years, which are infected with the human immunodeficiency syndrome type 1 (HIV-1) which caused the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).</seg>
<seg id="1905">For patients who cannot swallow the capsules, Agenase is available as a solution to take-up, but this cannot be taken together with Ritonavir, because the safety of this combination was not investigated.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Agenase should only be prescribed if the physician has tested, which has previously tested the antiviral medicines of the patient before, and the likelihood of being evaluated that the virus will be entrusted to the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily, taken together with 100 mg ritonavir daily and with other antiviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1908">For children between four and twelve years and with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of Agenase is aimed at body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">Genase reduces the HIV-amount of blood in combination with other antiviral medicines in the blood and keeps them at low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">AIDS is not able to cure AIDS. however, the fusion of the immune system and thereby improves the development of AIDS-related infections and diseases.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Agenase has been studied in combination with other antiviral medicines, however without Ritonavir, in two main studies with 736 HIV-infected adults who were previously treated with prototyped numbers.</seg>
<seg id="1912">This with low dosiavir increased medicine Agenase has been compared with 206 adults who had taken earlier protectors, with other types of proteins.</seg>
<seg id="1913">Principal indebator for efficacy was the proportion of patients with detectable concentrations of HIV in the blood (Viruslast) or the change of viruslast after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the studies with patients who had previously taken no protease inhibitor, after 48 weeks, more patients had a virusload under 400 copies / ml than placebo, but Agenase was less effective than indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children the virulls also reduced the virusload, but with the children who had been treated earlier with protectors, only very few to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study with adults who had been treated earlier with protectors, senijur amplifies the virusload to 16 weeks of treatment as effective as other protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In patients with HIV, that was resistant to four other proteins, it came under Agenase, along with Ritonavir to an increase of viruslast after four weeks, who had taken care of their previous release.</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common adverse events of Agenase (observes more than 1 of 10 patients) are headaches, diarrhoea (diarrhea), Nausea (nausea), vomiting, rash and Fatigue (fatigue).</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Agenase may not be applied in patients who are possibly supersensitive (allergic) against ambavir or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Agenase may also not be applied in patients, the currant herb (a vegetable preparation for treatment of depression) or medicinal products that are equally high as Agenase, are to be taken in high concentrations in the blood of harmful.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other medicines for HIV, the apurg (changes in the distribution of body fat), an osteoporosis (changes in the distribution of body fat), or an immunity activation (symptoms of an infection that caused the restoring immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">At the end, the Committee of Humanities (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Agenase in combination with other antiretroviral medicines for treating HIV-1-infected adults and children over four years were overwhelmed with the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Agenase is usually taken together with the pharmacokinetical amplifier Ritonavir, but the Committee set out that the benefits of Agenase in combination with Ritonavir in patients who have previously not detected any protease.</seg>
<seg id="1924">Agenase was originally approved in "extraordinary circumstances, as it has only limited information templates at the time of approval for scientific reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1925">In October 2000, the European Commission issued a approval for the company Glaxo Group Limited for the placing on the market of Agenase in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Genase is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral medicines for treating HIV-1- infected, protease inhibitor (PI) -pre-treated adults and children from 4 years onwards.</seg>
<seg id="1927">For usually, Agenase capsules should be administered to the pharmacokinetetic booster set of Ambavir, together with low doses of Ritoncar (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of Ambavir should be carried out in consideration of the individual viral resistors and the previous treatment of patients (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of Ambavir as a solution for injection is 14% lower than by ambavir as capsule; therefore, Agenase capsules and solution can not be interchangeable on a milligram per millimeter (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Agenase capsules is 600 mg of ambavir twice daily together with 100 mg of Ritoncar twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If Agenase capsules shall be applied without the amplification of Ritonavir (booster), higher doses have to be applied to Agenase (1200 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Agenase capsules is 20 mg of ambavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines of up to a daily intake of 2400 mg of ambavir, which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">Pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of Agenase in combination with low doses of Ritonavir or other proteins, were not investigated in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Genase is not recommended for application in children under 4 years of age, due to the absence of data concerning the unthinkable and effectiveness (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on pharmacokinetetic data the dose of Agenase capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily in adult patients with severe liver function, to 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">Concurrent use should be done in patients with mild or regular liver function with caution, in patients with severe liver function, it is contra-indicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Genase may not be given simultaneously with drugs which have a low therapeutic width and substrates the substrates of the cytochrome P450-Isoda ms 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Herbal preparations, the currant herb (hypericum perforation) included, may not be used due to risk reduction in plasma concentrations and a diminished therapeutic effect of ambavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">The patients should be pointed out that Agenase or any other antiretroviral therapy do not lead to the healing of HIV infection and that they may also develop opportunistic infections or other complications of a HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The current antiretroviral therapy including treatment with Agenase prevents the risk of transfer from HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">For usually Agenase capsules are to be used together with low doses of Ritoncar and combined with other antiretroviral medicines (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients who suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with antiretroviral combination therapy have increased risk of heavy liver effects involving potentially fatal behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="1943">For the fall of simultaneous antiviral treatment of hepatitis B or C, please read the relevant information about this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with existing reduced liver function, including a chronic active hepatitis indicate an increased frequency of liver function, under an antiretroviral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">The simultaneous use of Agenase and Ritonavir with fluorticason or other Glukokortic is not recommended unless the potential for the treatment of systemic corosteroider effects including Morbus Cushing and regression of the minor function (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">Since the incineration of the HMG-Coa reductase inhibitor and Simvastatin strongly dependent on CYP3A4 is not recommended for the increased risk of myopathies including Rhabdomyolysen.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some medicines that may cause serious or physical effects, phenobarbital, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and Warfarin (under surveillance of the International standardization ratio) are available methods.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients receiving this medicine at the same time, Agenase can be effective because of reduced plasma cutting of ambavir less (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility of metabolic interaction with ambavir, the efficacy of hormonal contradiction can be changed, but the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">If methadon is given with ambavir at the same time, the patient should therefore be monitored on opiatry symptoms, in particular if it is still very low doses of Ritoncar.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Due to the possible risk of toxicity of a toxicity in children under the age of four years, this formulation is indicated for children under an age of four years and should be used with care of certain other patient groups.</seg>

<seg id="2035">The receipt of the efficacy of Agenase in combination with Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily, based on the study PRO30017, a randomized open study (standard of care, SOC) and a standard therapy (standard of care, SOC) with a PI, mainly with lowest ritonvir, "received.</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred and threescore (n = 163) patients with subsequent virus sensitivity to Agenase, at least one other PI and at least one NRTI were included in the study study A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis introduced the non-sub-periority of APV / Ritonavir compared to the present-adjusted average change of the output (AAUCMB) in plasma after 16 weeks, with non-sub-cell shaft by 0.4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The receipt of the efficacy of unborn Agenase is based on two uncontrolled trials with 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18, of which 152 were treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies, Agenase solution was administered three times a day, 20 mg / kg three times daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily, while the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">There was no low-dosiavir at the same time; the majority of PI previously treated patients had at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the NRTIs.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks, about 25% of the patients included a plasma-HIV-1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase of CD4 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="2042">19 Based on these data, should be considered due to the expected benefits of "unforoostered" Agenase to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2043">According to oral administration, the average duration (Tmax) to the maximum serum concentration of Ambavir approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">508% increased for Cmax in contrast to 30%, when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered with Ambavir (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">Administration of Ambavir with a meal leads to a 25% decrease of AUC but has no effect on the concentration of ambavir 12 hours after dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore the minimum concentration in the Steady-State (Cmin, ss) remains unaffected by the food intake, although the simultaneous food intake increases the extent and rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent field of distribution is approximately 430 l (6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg) and can be connected to a large distribution volume and an imperative penetration of Ambavir from the blood circuit in the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change will result in a decrease of the total concentration of the active ingredient in plasma, with the amount of untreated ambavir which represents the active share probably remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While the absolute concentration of unborn ambavir remain constant, fluctuates the percentage of free active ingredients during the Steady-concentration camp in the Steady-State regarding the range of Cmax, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore, medicines that comprise the CYP3A4 or a substrate of CYP3A4, with caution to be given at the same time (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The gift of Agenase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily, leads to a similar daily Ambale exposure as with adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Ambavir is available in the solution 14% less flexible than the capsules; therefore Agenase solution and Agenase capsules are not interchangeable on a millionth basis.</seg>
<seg id="2053">It is also negligible Clearance of Ritonavir, therefore the impact of a renal renal impairment should be low to the elimination of ambavir and Ritoncar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">This treatment schemata lead to amalgam plasma levels comparable to those who are achieved in healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg of ambavir twice daily without a simultaneous administration of Ritoncar.</seg>

<seg id="2271">Aldurazyme is applied to treat patients with a Muesysaccharides I (MPS I; α-l-Iduronidase deficiency) to handle the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (the symptoms that are not related with brain or nerves).</seg>
<seg id="2272">This means that certain substances (glycopaminoglycane, gags) are not dismantled and thus blame in most organs in the body and damage them.</seg>
<seg id="2273">The following non-neurological symptoms of the MPS I can occur: increased liver, stiff joints, stimulating training, reduces lung volume, heart and eye diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2274">Treatment with Aldurazyme should be monitored by a physician, the experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other hereditary metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2275">The administration of Aldurazyme should be done in a hospital or clinic with resusability, and those patients require appropriate medicines to prevent allergic reaction.</seg>

<seg id="2277">In the study, mainly the safety of the medicine was investigated, however, its effectiveness was also measured by decreasing the reduction of GAG concentrations in the urine and in terms of the size of the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under five years, Aldurazyme knew the GAG concentrations in the urine around 60%, and half of the treated children showed a normal big liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common side effects of Aldurazyme in patients aged over five years (observed with more than 1 of 10 patients) are headaches, nausea, abdominal pain (joint pain), spinal pain, pain in the limbs (in hands and feet), heat compassion, fever and reactions to the infusion centre.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very common adverse events in patients under five years are increased blood pressure, reduced oxygen saturation (a measurement size of lung function), tachykarate (accelerated heart rate), fever and shrub frost.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyme may not react to patients who are possibly sensitive to laronidase or one of the other components (anaphylactic response), not used.</seg>
<seg id="2282">Every year, the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will be any of all new information that may be announced, check and check this summary.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The manufacturers of Aldurazyme will receive patients to observe the Aldurazyme with respect to the reactions to the infusion and the development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">June 2003, the European Commission announced the company Genzyme Europe BV permission for placing on the market of Aldurazyme in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a combinant form of humanoid α-l-Iduronidase and is produced using realistic DNA technology under the use of Cho-mammal cell cultures (Chinese Hamster Oops, Eierstock of the Chinese painter).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is indexed to the long-term enzyme Ukrain therapy (MPS I, α-l-Iduronidase deficiency, to handle the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">Treatment with Aldurazyme should be done by a physician, experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other hereditary metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased once every 15 minutes to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h can be increased.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and efficacy of alduryme in adults over 65 years was not determined, and for these patients cannot be recommended doses.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and efficacy of aldurazyme in patients with kidney or liver insufficiency has not been determined, and for these patients cannot be recommended doses.</seg>
<seg id="2291">With Aldurazyme treated patients may develop infusion-related reactions, which are defined as any other adverse events which occurs during the infusion, or until the end of the infusion day (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, these patients should continue to be closely monitored, and the infusion of Aldurazyme should be carried out only in an appropriate clinical environment, in the revival facilities for medical emergencies immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the Phase 3 clinical trial that virtually all patients IgG antibody being evaluated against Laronidase, usually within 3 months from the start of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an ininfusion-related reaction has to be treated with care of aldurazyme (see sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">As little experience regarding the recovery of the treatment after a longer break, it must be careful due to the theoretically increased risk reaction after a disruption of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2296">60 minutes before the beginning of the infusion with medications (antihistamine and / or antipyrka) to minimize the potential occurrence related reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In case of slight or intermediate-related reaction, treatment with antihistamines and Paracetamol / Ibuprofen to be performed and / or a reduction of infusion rate to half the infusion rate in which the reaction has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In case of a single, severe infusions-related reaction, infusion pump must be stopped, until the symptoms are dropped, treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / Ibuprofen is necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2299">The infusion can be achieved with a reduction of the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate when the reaction has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 are given (antihistamine and paracetamol / Ibuprofen and / or Corticosteroids) as well as a reduction of the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate when the previous reaction has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be applied simultaneously with chloroquin or Procain, because a potential risk of interference with the intracellular recording of Laronidase exists.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal experimental studies cannot be found on direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since there is no data of newborns that were exponated towards laronidase over the breast milk, is recommended to do during the treatment with Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2304">The adverse reactions in clinical trials were collected as ininfusion-related reactions, which were observed in 53% of patients in the Phase 3 study (treatment duration up to 4 years) and 35% of patients in the study were observed under 5 years (duration of treatment up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Undesirable drug interactions in connection with Aldurazyme, who were observed during the phase 3 years or older at a total treatment duration of up to 4 years, are commonly reported in the following table: very frequent (≥ 1 / 10 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with heavy MPS-I-related participation of the upper respiratory tracts and lung cancer, there were also heavy reactions, including bronchial enthusiasm, breathing space and visual acuity (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children unwanted drug interactions in connection with Aldurazyme, who were reported during a Phase 2 study, with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5, with predominantly heavier and a treatment duration of up to 12 months, are listed in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenously once weekly (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously every week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">Most patients came to a seropoconversion within 3 months after the treatment of the treatment, with a heaviest form mostly in one month at the age of 5 (on average after 45 days in patients at the age of 5 years and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Until the end of the phase 3 study (or up to a premature departure from the study) were found at 13 / 45 patients no detective antibodies (RIP) Assay, among them 3 patients who never came to Serconcerto.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with a lack of low antibody levels referred to a robust lowering of the GAG mirror in Harn, while in patients with high antibodies titres could determine a variable reduction of GAG in Harn.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in phase 3 trial and one in the Phase 2 study) showed a marginal propellous effect on the enzymatic Laronidase- activity in vitro that seemed to affect the clinical efficacy and / or the reduction of GAG in the Harn.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies seemed not to stand in connection with the incidence of undesired drug interactions, although the occurrence of unwanted drug interactions were typically fell along with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The cause for the enzyme otherapy is in one of the hydrolysis of accumulated substrate and the preventing a further accumulation of adequate restoration.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Following an intravenous infusion, Laronidase is quickly removed from circulation and cells into lysosomes, most probably about Mannose-6-phosphate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and effectiveness of Aldurazyme were examined in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study enrolled 45 patients at the age of 6 to 43 years.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study that had been recruited to the entire disease spectrum, the majority of patients from the mean phenotype and just one patient showed the heavy phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had a forcely expiratory volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand for 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for the effectiveness were the percentage of the expected FEV and the absolute walk in the 6-minute walk-test.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were then recruited for an open-label extension study, where they received 100 E / kg Aldurazyme every week for a further 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy, patients treated with Aldurazyme treated patients with the placebo group an improvement of lung function and the ability to be shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">When an open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintaining this effects of up to 208 weeks in deralderyme / Aldurazyme group and 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldura group, as shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease of the corresponding percentage of FEV is not significantly more than this period clinically, and the absolute lung volume increased more than proportionately of growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of the 26 patients with an hepatoma preceding the treatment, 22 (85%) reached a normal liver size by the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks a clear refuse of the GAG mirror was established in Harn (µg / mg of creatine) which remained constant until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">In terms of the heterogeneous disease manifestation between the patient, the clinically significant changes in the 6-minute walk-test, motion range of the shoulderage group (AHI and visual acuity), was generally an improvement in 26 patients (22%), no change in 9 patients (22%) and a deterioration in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">A one-year-old open phase 2 study was conducted in which mainly the safety and pharmacokinetics of Aldurazyme was examined at 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years old (16 patients with severe decay form and 4 with the mean shift form).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dosing was increased due to increased GAG- mirror in Harn in week 22 in the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients a magnitude of magnitude (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) was determined according to the Z Score for these age group (&lt; 2.5 years) and all 4 patients with severe contamination-form only limited or no progress in cognitive development.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase 4 study, investigations into the co-dynamic effects of various Aldurazyme doses of the GAG mirror were carried out on the GAG mirror in the Harn, the liver volume and the 6-minute walk test.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenously once weekly (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously every week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dosshema with 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks can be found in patients who have difficulties with weekly infusions, but is not detected that the long-term clinical efficacy of these two dosing schemata is equivalent.</seg>
<seg id="2333">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will evaluate any new information that will evaluate annually, and if necessary, the summary of the attributes of the medicine will be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2334">Pharmacokinetic profile in patients at the age of 5 was similar to patients with older and less affected patients.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Based on conventional clinical studies for safety-harmacology, toxicity in one-time gift, toxicity in recurrative gift and reproductive toxicity, cause preclinical data to recognize no special hazards for human beings.</seg>

<seg id="2355">Alimta is used in patients who were previously not treated with cisplatin, in combination with cisplatin, and in patients who previously used other chemotherapies as sole treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2356">To reduce side effects, patients during treatment with Alimta should get a corticosteroid and folic acid (a vitamin) and get injections of vitamin B12.</seg>
<seg id="2357">If Alimta is administered along with cisplatin, before or after the gift of Cisplatin, an "antiemetil" (medicines for vomiting) and liquids can be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In patients whose blood is changed, or of which certain other side effects occur, the treatment should be pushed forged, set up or reduced the dose.</seg>
<seg id="2359">The active form of Pemetrexed slows the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells that cells split.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The conversion of Pemetrexed in its active form is easier in cancer cells easier than in healthy cells, which leads to higher concentrations of the active form of the medicine and a longer period of effects in cancer cells.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Alimta was investigated for the treatment of malignant Pleuramesotheliitome in a main study of 456 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for their disease.</seg>
<seg id="2362">In the treatment of non-small lung cancer, the effects of Alimta in a study were compared to 571 patients with local advanced or metastatic breast cancer, previously compared to chemotherapy with the effects of docetaxel (any other medicines for cancer).</seg>
<seg id="2363">Alimta was also compared to gemcitabine (a further medicine against cancer), while both in combination with cisplatin in a study of 1 725 patients, previously had received no chemotherapy for lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2364">Patients who were treated with Alimta and cisplatin were average 12,1 months, compared to 9.3 months in the sole administration of cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2365">In patients who previously received chemotherapy was the average survival time with Alimta 8.3 months, compared to 7.9 months at docetaxel.</seg>
<seg id="2366">However, in both studies, patients who violate the squamous epithelial cells, during the administration of Alimta longer survival compared to cancer.</seg>

<seg id="2380">At the beginning of a new treatment cycle, a dose review will take place under the consideration of the Nadirs of the blood picture or the maximum non-hematological toxicity of the previous therapy cycles.</seg>
<seg id="2381">After recovery the patient must be treated according to the indications in the tables 1, 2 and 3, which can be used for ALIMTA as a monotherapyor in combination with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2382">These criteria meet the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) ≥ CTC degree 2 bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2383">Should patients do not develop hematological toxicity ≥ degrees 3 (except for neurotoxicity), treatment with ALIMTA needs to be interrupted before patient receiving the value before treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2384">Treatment with ALIMTA must be canceled if in patients after 2 dose reducers a hematological toxicity or non-hematological toxicity Grade 3 or 4 occurs or so- on the occurrence of degrees 3 or 4 neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical studies showed no indication that in patients at age 65, or above, compared to patients at the age of 65, an elevated side risk exists.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to lack of adequate data and effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical trials, a dose of ≥ 45 ml / min were not necessary in patients with a creatinin-Clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data situation in patients with a Kreatinin-Clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore the application is not recommended (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients with liver function limit of &gt; 1.5 times the upper Bilirubin- limit values and / or transaminases of &gt; to 3,0 fold the upper limit value (at the presence of liver lungs) are not specifically investigated in the studies.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients must be monitored via the bone marcation and Pemetrexed may not be administered to patients before the absolute neutrophilly number has reached a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thrombs has reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³.</seg>
<seg id="2391">A dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadir of absolute neutrophilic number and maximum non-hematological toxicity, as observed in the previous treatment cycles - (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lower toxicity and a reduction in Grade 3 / 4 hematological toxicity such as neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and infection with degrees 3 / 4 neutropenia was considered as a pretreatment with folic acid and vitamin B12.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore, all patients treated with Pemetry-treated patients must apply folic acid and vitamin B12 as prophylactic acid to reduce treatment-related toxicity (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to medium kidney failure (SNSAIDs) such as Ibuprofen and acetylsali- cylacid (&gt; 1.3 g daily) need to avoid late intoxicity and acetylsali- cylacid (&gt; 1.3 g daily) for at least 2 days before the therapy, at least 2 days after therapy (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2395">All patients receiving treatment with Pemetrexed should have to avoid the intake of NSAIDs with long half-life time for at least 5 days before the therapy, the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with Pemetrexed (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2396">Many patients where these events occurred, corresponding risk factors for the occurrence of renal events, including dehydration, pre-existing blood pressure or diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Therefore, in patients with clinically significant liquid collection, the collection of the transcellular space is supposed to be a draining of the ergonomical treatment before the Pemetremixed treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2398">5 serious cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular events were reported in clinical trials with Pemetrexed occasionally, when this drug was usually administered in combination with a different cytotoxic active substance.</seg>
<seg id="2399">For this reason, the simultaneous application of attenued living materials (except yellow fever, these vaccination is contra-indexed) not recommended (see section 4.3 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2400">As the possibility of an irreversible skull of the reproductive capacity should be rejected by Pemetremixed men before treatment, advice regarding spermaceration.</seg>
<seg id="2401">In patients with normal renal function (Kreatine-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) high doses of non-steroid antiphlogistika (NSAIDs) and acetylsalicylic acid in high dosage (≥ 1.3 g daily) to a reduced Pemetric pump outlet by a result of increased recovery of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Therefore, caution is recommended if in patients with normal renal function (Kreatine-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) high doses of NSAIDs or Ace- tylsalicylic acid can be used in high dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Ibuprofen) or acetylsalicyl- acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and minimally (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">Since there are no data regarding the interactions potential using NSAIDs with long half-time such as Piroxxicam or Rofecoxib, the simultaneous application must be avoided during therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with Pemetre- xed avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The large intra-individual variability of the modal status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral antioagulants and antineal chemotherapy requires an increased supervision of INR (International standardization ratio) when the decision was made to handle the patient with oral anticoagulants.</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are no data for the use of Pemetrexed to pregnant women but as with ande- antimetabolites are expected to be severe in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="2407">Pemetremixed may not be applied during pregnancy, except when necessary, and after careful disclosure of the user for the mother and risk for the fetus (see section 4.4).</seg>

<seg id="2609">The potency of Aloxi may be increased by the additional gift of a Corticosteroids (a drug that can be used as an antiemetaker).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The application in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended because the effects in this age group is not enough information.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the active substance prevents the bond of a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamin (5HT, also known as serotonin) to the receptors in the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Aloxi was studied in three main studies in 1 842 adults who received chemical therapies, which are strong or moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">For chemotherapies, the strong trigger for nausea and vomiting, 59% of patients showed no vomiting in the 24 hours after receiving chemotherapy (132 from 223), compared to 57% of patients treated with Ondansetron patients (126 from 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">At chemotherapies, the excessive trigger for nausea and vomiting, 81% of patients showed no vomiting in the 24 hours after receiving chemotherapy (153 of 189), compared to 69% of patients treated with Ondansetron (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">For a comparison with dagetron these values were 63% for alxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 of 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">March 2005, the European Commission announced the company of Helsinki Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd., a approval for the market placing of Aloxi in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indexed: for prevention of acute nausea and vomiting in strongly emetogenic chemotherapy due to cancer disease and vomiting in moderate chemotherapy due to cancer disease.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The efficacy of alxi for prevention of nausea and vomiting, which is produced by a highly significant chemotherapy alone, can be strengthened by adding a corticosteric chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Da Palonosetron can prolong the colodarkage should be monitored by anamnesty Objecation or Anmark of a Subacute Ileus following injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">As with other 5HT3-antagonists however, caution is recommended for the benefit of pallonosetron with drugs which prolong the QT intervals or in patients where the QT- interval is prolong or which tend to an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">Except in connection with another chemical agents, alxi shall neither be used to treat nausea and vomiting in the days after receiving chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical studies, Palonosetron did not affect the activity of the five studied chemotherapeutics (cisplatin, Cyclophosphamide, Cycloabine, Doxorubicin and Mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">A clinical study showed no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between one-time intravenous dose of palm-osetron and a steady moclopramids, a CYP2D6 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In one of a population based pharmacokinetetic analysis, Chloretidine, cannotine, rentanoxin, anoperiod, riteridol, anitabidl, ritonavir, sertraline and Terbafin) had no significant impact on clearing of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experience for application of pallonosetron in human pregnancies lie not before, therefore Palonosetron should not be applied during pregnant women, unless it is necessary to be used from the treated doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2626">In clinical trials, the most common adverse events were observed with a dose of 250 micrograms (a total of 633 patients), at least allied with alxi in connection, headaches (9%) and Objecation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of survival actions and reactions in the administration site (burning, hardening, complaints and pain) have been reported in post-marketing experience.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage, similar number of adverse events were similar to the other dosing groups; there were no dose-effective relations.</seg>

<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind studies, 1,132 mg / m2 Cisplatin, carboplatin, ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 of cytometron (half-time 4 hours) or 100 mg of Dolassetron (half-time 7.3 hours) received intravenously to Day 1 without a dexamethasone intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomized double-blind study, 667 patients were randomised to ≥ 60 mg / m2cisplatin, with patients compared to which 32 mg of Ondansetron received the 32 mg of Ondansetron that have been administered to Day 1.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of studies with moderate chemotherapy and the study of strongly emetogenic chemotherapy are summarised in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical studies for the indication of chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the effects of Palonosetron were comparable to blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters including the corresponding effects of Ondansetron and Dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">After the findings of the clinical research, Palonosetron has the ability to block the inventricular de- and Repolarisation involved in its power channels and extend the duration of the shareholder potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study carried out at 221 healthy volunteers were the assessment of ECG-effects of an acute palonosetron in single doses of 0.25, 0,75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption According to intravenous gift to a initiating decline of plasma concentrations have a slow elimination of body with an average initial half-time period of about 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and the area under the concentration process (AUC0- ∞) are generally distributed in the entire dose range from 0.3- 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">Following an intravenous gift of Palonosetron 0,25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses of 11 Hodencarcinoma patients measured between day 1 and day 5 measured mean (± SD) increase in Palonosetron plasma concentration at 42 ± 34%.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Pharmacokinetic simulations shows that once a daily intravenous administration of 0.25 mg Palonosetron reached total value of 0.25 mg of Palonosetron in 3 consecutive days; however, the Cmax reached a value of 0.75 mg higher.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% are eliminated to the kidneys and about another 50% are converted into two primary metabolites that have less than 1% of antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro studies for metabolisation have shown that CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 inhibiting diseases are involved in the metabolism of palm-osetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination of a intravenous dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron were found approximately 80% of the dose within 144 hours of urine, palm-osetron as unchangeable drug made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">Following a single intravenous bolting injection in healthy, the total body of the body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal cleance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">Although in patients with severe liver function, the terminal reduction of Eliminosetron are increased, but the average systemic exposition with palonosetron increases, however, a reduction of the dose is not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In clinical trials, effects were observed only after expositions that are considered adequate over the maximum of human exposure exposure, which indicates a low relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10. clinical studies showed that Palonosetron can be blocked only in very high concentrations of iridium channels, which can be involved in ventricular de- and Repolarisation and extend the duration of action.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of palm-osetron (each dose were given in some 30 times of therapeutic exposure to humans), which resulted in a multiple frequency of liver tumors, endocrine Neoplasms (in thyroid, pituitary, pancreas, trinierenmark) and skin tumors with rats, but not in mice.</seg>

<seg id="2670">The number of patients with hepatitis C which relate to the treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A, was similar in clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After adjusting the treatment with Alpheon fire the disease was upset again in more patients than at the reference agent; Moreover, Alpheon had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Apart from this study the drug was used to examine the question, to what extent the medicine forms an immune response (i.e. the bodies) antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine), not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used for the treatment of Impetigo (one with crudenial of skin infection) and small inted laxis (Riss- or chives), diced and steered wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Allogo is not to be used to treat infections, which causes detectable or presumably caused by methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), because algo does not affect this kind of infections.</seg>

<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are applied to protection against the same disease, but Twinrix adults and Twinrix children are given in the framework of one of three doses of the vaccination.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix adult identical ingredients, some of the data that supports the application of Twinrix adults, also used as a cover for the application of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator for the efficacy was the proportion of vaccinated children who had developed a month after the last injection a protective antibody.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study of 208 children, the effectiveness of the vaccine was compared with a six-month and a 12 month distance between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambirix led between 98 and 100% of the vaccinated children a month after the latest injection to develop anti-violence against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambirix was similar at a six-month distance between the injections.</seg>

<seg id="2811">At the end, the Committee for Humanities (CHMP) came to the conclusion that ammoniers were effectively preventing high ammonohydrates in patients with disturbances of the urinary cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2812">Under "extraordinary circumstances, the children of Ammon was approved, because due to the rarity of the disease at the time of approval only limited information on this medicine templates.</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indexed to all patients with a complete enzyme already in newborns (within the first 28 days of life).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with late manifold form (incomplete enzyme that is manifested according to the first life of life), there is an indication for the use when in the anamity of a hyperammonastic emmissible spongiform encephalopathy.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are not able to swallow tablets or for patients with hatch disorders, AMMONAPS will also be available in granite.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is individually calculated under consideration of the protein tolerance and for the development and development of necessary daily protein intake of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to previous clinical experiences the normal daily dose of sodium polyphenylbutyrat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as with children growing and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">In patients who suffer from an early manifold deficiency of Carbamylphosphatrice or Ornithinscarscarce, is required substitution of citderlin or arinine in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with a arginine-synthetic deficiency need arinine in a dosage of 0.4 to 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15,4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets are not given to patients with hatch disorders, as a risk for the emergence of Ösophagulcervzera exists if the tablets are not immediately reached in the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Every tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) sodium, equivalent to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrat, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS should therefore be used in patients with congestiver heart failure or severe kidney failure, as well as with sodium injury and eye-up clinical trials only be used with caution.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Because Metabolisation and precipitation of sodium phenylbutyrat concerning the liver and the kidneys, AMMONAPS should be used in patients with liver or kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these results in terms of pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contra-indicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">In subcutaneous administration of phenylacetate on young rats at high dosage (190 - 474 mg / kg), a slowdown of neuronal proliferation and increased loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">It also found a delayed maturation of cerebrals synapses and a reduced number of working neurons in the brain and thus a disability in brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be found if phenylacetate is eliminated from the breast milk and the use of AMMONAPS during a nursing time (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS, 56% of patients showed at least an unwanted event (AE) and at 78% of these undesired events were assumed that they were not connected with AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: (≥ 1 / 10), commonly (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18 year old anoretic patient, who developed a metabolic drug in combination with lactite outlet, heavy hypocalanemia, armistochemistry, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">A case of an overdose occurred with a 5-month small child with an outstanding single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms pass with the accumulation of phenylacetate, which showed a dossizeable neurotoxicity with an intravenous administration of up to 400 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is a metabolic active compound that conjugated to phenylacetylglutamine with glutamine, that is left over the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Stools saw phenylacetylglutamine with urea (both compounds contain 2 nitric atoms); Phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier to the loss of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with disturbances of the urinary cycle can be assumed that each gram of protein polyphenylbutyrat between 0,12 and 0.15 g of phenylacetyloamin-nitrogen are produced.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is of meaning that the diagnosis is early and the treatment started immediately to improve the survival of survival and clinical outcome.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The forecast of the early manifold form of the disease with initial symptoms in newborns age was almost always infamaust, and the disease resulted in treatment with peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids, or with its hemicular analogues for death within the first year of life.</seg>
<seg id="2838">Due to Hemodialysis, the exploitation of alternative ways of nitrogen oxide (sodium hydrochlorylacetate), proteinous food and possibly substitution of essential amino acids was possible to increase the survival rate of newborrowed (however within the first month) diagnostic diseases to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy, the survival rate was 100%, but even during these patients it came with time during many spiritual abilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with late manifold form of the condition (including female patients with a heterozygylscarlet deficiency), which were treated from a hyperammonary encephalopathy and a proteinous diet was treated with a protein reduced rate of 98%.</seg>

<seg id="2842">It is known that Phenylbutyrat is oxidized to phenylacetate, which is conjugated in liver and kidney disease with glutamine, with phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites in plasma and urine samples were determined according to an individual dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrat with liver cirrhosis as well as repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day (not controlled trials).</seg>

<seg id="2879">Angiox is used to treat patients with "acute grain syndrous" (ACS, reduced blood supply to heart), for example when instabilty angina (heart attack with different thickness) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) (an anomal measurement value for electrocardiogram or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">When Angiox is used to prevent blood clots in patients who should undergo one PCI, a higher dose is administered and the infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This may contribute to patients with Angina or cardiac disease to maintaining a blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS, where the effect of Angiox in sole treatment or in combination with a glycoprotein-IIb / IIIa inhibitor (GPI, a different medicines for preventing blood clots) was compared to another antibody treatment (another anticoagulans) and a GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">During the PCI was often a Stent (a short tube that remains in the arteries to prevent a lock) and they received additional medicines for preventing blood clots, such as Abcioximab and Aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">The treatment of ACS was Angiox - with or without gift of GPI - preventing new events (deaths, heart failure or Revascularisation) after 30 days or a year as effective as conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients receiving one PCI was Angiox in relation to all indicators as effective as Heparin, with severe bleeding, with which it was significantly more effective than Heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox should not be applied in patients who are possibly supersensitive (allergic) against bivalirudine, other brain areas or one of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="2887">There may not be used in patients who recently had a blood pressure, as well as with people with strong blood pressure or heavy kidney problems or a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="2888">At the conclusion, the Committee for Humanities (CHMP) reached the conclusion that Angiox is used for the treatment of ACS and during one PCI for an acceptable replacement for Heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission announced the Company The Medicines Company UK Ltd. approval for the placing of Angiox in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute grain syndromes (instincile angina / dis- ST-midical) (IA / NSTEMI)) for an emergency handle or when an early intervention is foreseen.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended initial dosage of Angiox in patients with ACS is a intravenous bolting of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If a PCI is carried out a PCI, an additional Bolus of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the infusion for the duration of the procedure is increased to 1,75 mg / kg / h.</seg>

<seg id="2894">Immediately prior to the procedure, a feed rate of 0.5 mg / kg should be administered, followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dosage of Angiox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intravenous bolting of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and one of the intravenous intravenous infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg of body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and effectiveness of a sole Bolus gift by Angiox was not investigated and is not recommended, even if a short PCI procedure is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT after 5 minutes) is shortened to under 225 seconds, a second bolt of magnitude of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should be shortened.</seg>
<seg id="2898">To reduce the occurrence of low ACT values, the reconstituted and diluted medicinal products should be thoroughly blended and the bolt dosage should be administered intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">Once the ACT is greater than 225 seconds, a further monitoring is not required, provided, the 1,75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with moderate kidney-functional limitations (GFR 30-59 ml / min), which are subjected to a PCI (whether with Bivalirudin against ACS or not), a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used.</seg>

<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that at subcutaneous Gaetbe of insulin pisulisin the efficiency rate is faster and the effects shorter is shorter than at hu- manem regular insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study involving 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes mUS showed insulin effects of 0,075 to 0.15 e / kg, a proportion of proportionate gluing effect, and at 0.3 E / kg or more a lower proportion of gluing effect, precisely like humanimulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin lulisin has a double so fast working speed, such as normal human humanulin and achieves the complete gluing effect approximately 2 hours earlier than humanist ulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">From the data was evident that a comparable post-buffer glycemic inspection was achieved in 2 minutes before meal a comparable postprancal control, which is given 30 minutes before meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">Insulin-ulisulisin 2 minutes before meal was achieved, a better postpranal control was achieved with humanized normal interest ulin, which was taken 2 minutes before the meal was reached.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If insulin is turned in 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal, a comparable glycemic control of the meal is given (see Figure 1) before meal.</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin delivery in Gabe 2 minutes (GLULending - before) before the meal was given (figure 1A) before the beginning of the meal (Figure 1A) as well as compared to humankind (Fig. L - before) before a meal was given (figure 1B).</seg>
