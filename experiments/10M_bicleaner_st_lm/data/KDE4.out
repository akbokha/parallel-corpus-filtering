a rectangle may be lab@@ eled with the different characteristics of the appropriate file or folder . for each feature you may be displayed , only if sufficient space is available , or if the area of sub@@ ordin@@ ated det@@ ach@@ ments shall occur . furthermore , you can define the relative position of the label in rectangle below .
at Dar@@ em@@ ap , the rule should be kept proportional to the size of the entry . at the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; fs@@ view , this target will not always be adher@@ ed to . during the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; fs@@ view , this target will not always be available . note that less space for the frame is lost , if the rectangle is square .
as the allocation of the area of an entry to the sub@@ ordin@@ ated entries , the implementation will remain so , so that rec@@ tan@@ kers can occur as possible . the best methods are possible to include lines , columns or recur@@ sive second line .
you can design@@ ate the minimum area for an entry for the menu entry view . instead , a room pattern is drawn into the area of over@@ arch@@ ed entry , to indicate that this area is actually indicated by an lower entry .

&amp; digi@@ plug ; provides a light table in a separate window with which you can easily compare pictures . it works with all supported image file formats , also raw files , together .
select one or more images from any view in the main window , and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L to the light table add from the context menu . when you come back to &amp; digi@@ s ; main window are , you can open the light table fast with L ex@@ tras .
from the preview strip you can compare the images that you want to compare in the left or right area of the window . if you can preview it in one of the images , then you will compare these pictures to the other image . so you can compare the same range of both pictures .
another mode is better suited to view quickly from a picture series . if you want to navigate directly into the areas of the tool@@ bar , then you can view the left mouse button on an aspect of preview it will display in the right area . this simpli@@ fies the right section . this simpli@@ fies it through a number of similar images .
of course , the normal soldering actions can also work directly from the light table , such as F4 file ....
all picture information from the right side bar of the master window are available for both performance pictures in the light table . this makes it e.g. just visual differences with exposure data .
at the lower end of each area you will find a built @-@ in sw@@ ing@@ ing function which you need to click on the cross@@ roads . in order to hold the visible area of the image , you need to preview it and the &amp; L@@ MB ; in mode preview the same pictures will show the same image area .
the zo@@ oming works as well as in other views . simply use the zoom kno@@ b below the images or C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and to zoom out . this happens in both pictures when you &apos;re in preview .
what is a digital stock management - is considered part of the fashion address . if the image has been taken up to final issue and the permanent store . each of the photos records , sc@@ anned and digital photos saves a form of digital components , but most of us do not make this in a systematic and efficient manner .
we give you a tool to ass@@ ure a plan and practical tips like you can back up your photos , protect and retri@@ eve your photos . we are looking back to use , retri@@ eve , ass@@ ure , ass@@ ure , ass@@ essing , optim@@ istic , archiving , waiting and exp@@ orting image files .
&amp; quot ; Digital inventory management is based on inde@@ xed , categor@@ izing , sec@@ ures , trans@@ forms , trans@@ forming and exported content that hab@@ it a mon@@ etic or cultural value . quot ;
met@@ ad@@ ata is defined as data via data . met@@ ad@@ ata is provided according to your definition data , data information or documentation provided by any application or environment .
I travel to claim if you need more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you don &apos;t need to find out how many photos you have to store in a database as well as to the image files are guaranteed very fast searching and secure backup to access you with other programs , platforms and formats freely .
the first thing you need and know what to maintain in your system . you have to decide whether other access will be on your computer , whether you want to save them on your computer , or on a network drive &amp; etc ; make sure you need to switch off on a bigger drive .
perhaps you will be happy with this structure . if you can be found quickly over your location . if you &apos;re able to organize your memory , then you &apos;ll be able to use sub@@ folder as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . export to a folder that you will print or publish on a website .
professional photograph@@ ers have other requirements such as ver@@ sion@@ ing the photos , archiving , working processes , constant supply of images on different themes and a large number of all . within 10 years , 95 % archives and 5 % work files are and you will not want to organize your structure for this content .
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes the batch processing simple . separated from old files .
the separation of original and desktop simpli@@ fies the backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or derived image .
we also recommend to save the met@@ ad@@ ata option in the site of the met@@ ad@@ ata in &amp; digi@@ al . if you forget this , you can then select the met@@ ad@@ ata from the database into the files by clicking the appropriate point in the menu album .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change ? well , they are going to do with them a met@@ ad@@ ata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important .
now , the real work , since you should select any photo pass@@ words , sh@@ ri@@ ft@@ ings and an assessment . of course you can select the same attri@@ bute and set the value . this makes sense , since you can concentrate on the best photos .
try us now with keywords , keywords , such as you often have in other programs . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same matter .
when you import Catal@@ og@@ ative pictures from a different source with embedded sample words , then the images are attached to the right place . this sort of Hier@@ archy within the tree is no problem and can be easily done by drag a sub @-@ tree to another . the changed words are done by &amp; digi@@ ous ; updated while it is pursued by sub@@ trees .
the graphics shows how different met@@ ad@@ ata over . this is a very rough representation , since each block of met@@ ad@@ ata consists in truth from many sections . file names and calendar data features properties of all pictures .
enough of keywords - the next section refers to sh@@ ri@@ ft@@ ings or comments using the third important tool to catal@@ og@@ ize your met@@ ad@@ ata .
you want to view most ni@@ em@@ anden your photos just , you want to share them with your friends , your family , other photograph@@ ers and agencies . they are sure interested in your photos .
look at this panorama . from the distance is not even a nice beach panorama . if you consider it closer , then start to see some details , people , the place .
and now I tell you this of the landing area of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing . Wow , you might want to hear the silence , you can even hear the silence , so you can hear your perception of this panorama .
for other photos consider the title may be more important than the image itself . if you are showing images , you should tell a story . remember , the key is to help us to understand the motive which you move , what you can understand what you understand .
it is fine if a picture is not perfect when it has the strength only with a label for yourself alone .
with &amp; digi@@ plug ; you can also store a lot of text , in an internation@@ al@@ pha@@ bet ( UTF @-@ 8 ) , then you can export it for a selection of images . if you want to export your images in the label and / or the titles of the Web @-@ Gal@@ eri@@ es@@ system . you must tell the story so for the opening hours .
do you remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find out another city without navigation system ? was it not a bor@@ ing planet before Google Earth ? well , because with pictures , the train of the spatial presentation has already been with light speed .
the possibilities the ge@@ ol@@ oc@@ alization can be in@@ separable . I am sure that one day , in the future , you can repeat your journeys through images with geographical information . you can also export the pictures at the reception . you can also export the pictures at Gall@@ ery@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a voc@@ abul@@ ary with copyright and signi@@ fies the practice of copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on distribution and alter@@ ation of copies . the same fre@@ ed@@ oms are also valid in all changed versions , so also for the work of others .
the following description you will tell you what information in the installation page of the digi@@ plug comes ; as information should be depos@@ ited :
author ( syn@@ onym for invent@@ ors and author ) : this field should add your name , or the name of the photographer , for example , if it does not wish to change the name of the photographer , for example , if it does not wish to change the name of the photographer , it should not be changed . this field does not support clusters nor semi @-@ partition .
car titles ( syn@@ onym for the author ) : linked with the author . examples of this field contains the work name of the photographer , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer . since this is a mer@@ mer@@ k to the author , this must be also completed .
publisher ( syn@@ onym for suppliers ) : do you use the clu@@ sion field to identify who this photo must be listed here . if the photographer can not necessarily be shown here . if the image is a storage photo here , the group / agency will find the picture here .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although they have no protection against abuse . each of which is a little more than basic knowledge in work with calcul@@ ator . this problem is for most of your photos only by low interest . for professionals and hold professionals , this protection is very important for professionals .
the digital water@@ mark is unique in each image . &amp; digi@@ plug ; there will be such a module for p@@ ile processing in the near future .

of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs that have lost on the road or a fire . this kind of losses are the same that you can also happen in traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section , it is possible to solve problems with the so @-@ called New Media .
Kro@@ ll On@@ track , the largest data manufacturer in the world , has some interesting statistics , which has a data loss .
in order to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs , you can do so much longer than a few years . of course you can claim your CDs and DVDs in archive quality . of course , you can claim your CDs and DVDs in archive quality . if you can claim a lifetime of 100 years for themselves , you can claim your life @-@ life of 100 years for themselves .
CD / DVD discs can be un@@ readable , but you can reduce this risk in which you can do good Dis@@ ks and good recording devices . best DVD recording tools are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write much reliable . it &apos;s turn to the right .
CDs and DVDs are very vulner@@ able for errors , even if you &apos;re just written . therefore , we use a control mechanism to protect themselves . 75 % of the data are required for form@@ att@@ ing and control . despite this massive protective words they are due to chemical ageing , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc .
for defective CDs and DVDs , it &apos;s a reasonable program called I@@ so@@ B@@ uster . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux ; but is not yet available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications that damaged data from damaged disk images , hard disks , flash media , USB drives etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray Dis@@ ks seem to save the format war against the HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disk can save 50 GB and thus says almost six times the capacity of a Dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB . of course , it is also applicable for the Blu @-@ ray disk .
check out slowly with a good recording range of high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ etary format . read the data again to check out a clean , dark dry and protected areas . do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media , or software that can read out these media .
disk manufacturers retain your statistics for itself . their manufacturers offer a new disk , but not the data . Google has a large field study on the errors of hard disks : disk missing
shortly : dis@@ cos have the most frequent errors in the temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C . with lower temperatures , SM@@ ART may not determine the fault errors . some of the SM@@ ART provides errors immediately . the expected lifetime of life is between 4 and 5 years .
this is the complete losses due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also have data loss due to a power failure before you have backed the files , but these losses can normally be changed without any large problems .
while most electrical devices should not make much account , these can take heavy damage in devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed processes . these can cause severe damage , hardware @-@ aging , imp@@ lic@@ ate mother@@ boards and other defects . do not use inev@@ itable that lead to a loss of time and money .
most common protection against electricity points is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs a part of energy @-@ heat and rest . it is normally available in the form of a plug @-@ in connector . remember that every plug @-@ in strip also contains a over@@ voltage protection .
if you &apos;re looking for an over@@ voltage protection , then you should pay attention to the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a particular minimum of protection . you should also make sure that it protects against flash stop and thereby protects the correctly connected devices .
as a over@@ voltage can use each cable to your computer , you should make sure that all the peri@@ pher@@ als can also be protected from your system . some manufacturers represent over@@ voltage controllers also include a telephone connection for your modem . others provide connection options for co@@ axial cable of cable mo@@ dems and TV card .
if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are developed specifically for not@@ eb@@ ooks , and therefore also contain the protection for the modem . so you are ideal for traveling .
while a over@@ voltage protection your system will not be used before smaller variations in the supply lines , it will not really help you with a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds can be able to give loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it may therefore make sense to invest in a interrup@@ tible power supply .
in addition to the protection against over@@ voltages , these devices can be able to store the power failure . if you buy a US@@ V , you should be sure that they will meet the same quality requirements such as an over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the life time of the battery and the supplied software can be interesting .
consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed and compare its safety with currents to avoid these . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can be adjusted for less than &amp; euro ; 40 . this is just a small price difference if you &apos;re thinking as well as your calcul@@ ator . at the end , you should always think all cables before you go into the holiday .
the Amazon Web Service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - an easy storage service . with the correct configuration , you can use it as a drive under &amp; Linux ; Mac , and Windows . this allows you to store this as backup destination for your software . Google Sh@@ ared storage is another popular offer with which you can save any quantity of data .
however , they are at home very expensive in comparison to the hard drives , but $ 40 per year and / / dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB , you need to send the data about the compar@@ atively slow internet .
the solutions are therefore suitable for a solution against a local data loss of the most important images . it is not a bad solution , but it is not a common backup solution . therefore it is too slow .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Yahoo ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the Photo Community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com make online storage services that have no longer available to photos , in case of Fli@@ ck@@ r dram@@ atically . for $ 25 a year , you get unlimited memories , which should be reviewed only in reality .
from the point of view of data backup , web solutions are very secure . transfer errors will automatically adjusted for the TCP protocol and the big companies are included in the offer a backup and a distributed memory . so they are des@@ ast@@ er@@ able .
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in calcul@@ ator . all transfers are sus@@ cep@@ tible to transfer errors . the file system needs and b@@ tr@@ fs are at least the data integrity between the operating system and disk .
the worst thing about it is that nobody should happen if this happens in your hardware . all these disorders remain un@@ discovered until you don &apos;t find it . no one seems to have thought about it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a significantly more secure data transfer than that of your computer .
un@@ reliable power supplies are a further source for transmission losses , as they generate inter@@ ferences within the data stream . in normal file systems this error will be un@@ noticed .
even if you are currently not affected by trans@@ missions problems , you should look into the future . in 2010 , you will see thousands of errors per year .
Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two Candi@@ dates back to lower level . it is open source , with many patents and is available under one to G@@ PL , compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope for &amp; Linux ; and Windows available . read this article in English .
Oracle has launched its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs file system . it is still in the Alpha status . it uses the same protection mechanisms that is used and is also available for &amp; Linux ; but it is not part of the kernel .
not estimate that these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the data losses related to not@@ ebook and 46 % if not@@ eb@@ ooks now amounts to 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less widespread than most fran@@ chis@@ els . it is currently limited to a lower damage , such as th@@ ieves or new installations ; Apple users know only very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; it was already any longer sigh@@ ted .
open Source file systems are less sus@@ cep@@ tible to data loss as propri@@ etary systems : false , N@@ TF@@ S is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reis@@ er@@ F@@ s , J@@ FS and X@@ FS file system . please find a very good English articles here .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process during an eye is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . if a file is not saved before the problem was lost , it is lost .
viruses are the biggest thre@@ ats for digital data : false , theft and human error are the main causes of data loss .
digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aperture settings from fundamental physical bound@@ aries . that is , while the technology is further developed , there is a natural limit for these progress . sensitivity and smo@@ ky plastics are not far away from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras continue in direction of 10 meg@@ api@@ x@@ el@@ sensors . even though this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and the end result is optimized for compact cameras . even DSLR cameras have their limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . for higher resolutions , you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24x@@ 36@@ mm ) or greater formats .
a 750@@ GB hard drive today will receive you for 100 &amp; euro ; so you do not have any data loss affected by any data loss . so secure your data on a plan and test this backup before you make something similar as the re@@ install of your operating system , replacing the exchange of disks or the size of hard drives .
supp@@ ose you take daily your securities on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a flash , you &apos;re lucky when the drive was not connected in the moment .
a disaster hit locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget aircraft accident : fire , water , electricity , children and th@@ ieves are dangerous enough for your data . they usually affect a whole room or entire house .
therefore Des@@ ast@@ er@@ ance is always a non @-@ local storage . bring your f@@ uses up the stairs into the neighboring house , into your office or similar .
there is another advantage of the physical isolation : as above already said is a common cause for a data loss in spite of the pan@@ ic . if you have a backup that is not available immediately , then you can save one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all the files should be backed up . it is a snap@@ shot without histor@@ ies and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential backup : the backup of the files have been changed since the last complete backup . generates a complete snap@@ shot at two time points : the complete backup and the last differential pressure .
incre@@ mental backup : one backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . you can restore the original status at any time . this backup is on the next to the next with the exception that it is only get@@ away and not continued .
r@@ sync is a wonderful small tool that can easily be set up easily on your machines . in contrast to script file sharing or other types of file trans@@ missions copies r@@ sync only the difference of files that were really changed . this happens if you want to increase security over ss@@ h .
secure important images directly after you store them on your computer on a DVD or another optical medium .
this approach takes you enough time to detect losses and restore . at the same time you get a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly basis for at least one month and a moment update for every month . every additional di@@ lution should be done manually after which you made a complete review .
topics : met@@ ad@@ ata , stored in the image file stored IP@@ TC , associated X@@ MP files , original store , storage , scal@@ ability , media , editing images and met@@ ad@@ ata , copy of images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , vision devices , ... , usage of the Internet .
thus valuable pictures will survive the next 40 years that time , about the period in which you really interested in you , because they remember your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered :
since the future is fore@@ se@@ eable because of nature is un@@ predic@@ table , everything is said today . unfortunately , there is no other way to evaluate the current system back@@ ward . if less variants are used in the past , it is easier to evaluate the questions of the future .
this question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document . use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications .
virtualization is now available for everyone . if you have an old system that is important for reading your pictures , then keep it on and install it in a virtual machine for a later use .
on the other hand the Council is quite easy : definitely if you want to change your computer architecture , your memory and security technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert any newer standard . stay in open standards .
scal@@ ability is the expert pressure to change a system in its size . this means it actually increase .
let &apos;s go from that you have the scal@@ ability with im@@ plant and put the area you want to enlarge it on a dedicated plate or partition . at * nix systems such as &amp; Linux ; can copy it and store them on a new record :
check with the command d@@ mes@@ g , whether your new record is detected by the system , but do not hang it .
/ dev / S@@ DC # Source can / dev / S@@ DC # Source is / dev / S@@ DC # Source , the new record is / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of the plate in MB@@ ens ; # works with ext@@ 2,3 , FAT@@ 16 , 32 and reis@@ fs &amp; dollar change ; resi@@ ce@@ 2@@ fs / dev / SM # 1 # change the size of reis@@ fs if necessary
open Source Standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even when a day no software can read it , then you can create this yourself . this task will be easier by year to year easier .
GIF is a propri@@ etary , patented format which dis@@ appears slowly from the market . you should therefore not use it anymore .
P@@ NG was developed as an open source standard , however . it can save much more . it is loss @-@ free , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC met@@ ad@@ ata , but not as many as TIFF needed and a slow compression technique . this format will we recommend you to store your pictures .
TIFF was widely distributed as image format . I can store images in un@@ compressed form or stored in a container with a loss@@ less compression algorithm . a problem is however to store your pictures in this format . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG , the Digital Neg@@ ative file format is a license @-@ free and open cru@@ de format developed by Adobe Systems . D@@ NG has been developed for using met@@ ad@@ ata . a hand@@ ful camera vend@@ or is now available and we hope to use the competitors &apos; Canon and Nikon .
this is probably one of the reasons why , around 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML based X@@ MP technology to make the &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Met@@ ad@@ ata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; provides a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a key marking which users are allowed to enter into a file itself . the file information is stored for XML / R@@ DF .
many photograph@@ ers go ahead of the original of your recording , mostly archi@@ ved in the raw format , but it can occur separately from the image file . so it can &apos;t notice the raw format . therefore , you should put them on whether you use D@@ NG to use the container and put everything there together .
the Dublin Core Met@@ ad@@ ata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online met@@ ad@@ ata standards , supporting a wide range of uses and modelling , discussions and community work in the D@@ C@@ MI communities , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and trans@@ figured efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of met@@ ad@@ ata standards and practices .
import pictures from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . so long the pictures on the camera are , you can use this as temporary f@@ use .
convert raw files to D@@ NG and store this in your tube archive . this function is not implemented yet .
for a host@@ ile processing you can use external programs . if you come back to &amp; digi@@ plug ; then you should add the met@@ ad@@ ata again . these were cut off the met@@ ad@@ ata under circumstances .
protect the mach@@ ined pictures for the copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export it then in web galleries , en@@ code to MPEG , use in contact page , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ .@@ In the section adding a photos to you . in the section you can add a description as you can already add on your hard disk . but the camera interface offers you many advanced settings for import@@ ing images to your Alb@@ end@@ aten@@ bank .
to use your digital camera &amp; digi@@ plug ; connect this with the computer , switch the camera on the display mode and switch them . a further description can be found in the manual of your camera .
when you start the camera interface , the camera tries to connect to your camera . if the connection is made , the fil@@ en@@ ame is displayed on the lower end and the pictures will be shown . if this is the case , the fil@@ en@@ ame is displayed and a symbol for file assignment for any file , photos , movies , music , etc .
before you can download the photos on your computer , you may need to view the camera information on each entry . using the lateral handles and met@@ ad@@ ata from the camera interface , you can see the characteristics of a entry or his met@@ ad@@ ata .
this dialog features fil@@ tering characteristics and photo information that can be saved internally of the camera . a symbol indicates that the picture has not been downloaded on your computer . note that for some digital cameras not all available .
the rider met@@ ad@@ ata shows the internal met@@ ad@@ ata such as EX@@ IF , manufacturer &apos;s instructions , GPS etc. of the picture . these information are the same as in the met@@ ad@@ ata side@@ bar in the main window of &amp; digi@@ al ; or the picture processing . please note that these met@@ ad@@ ata is not available on some digital cameras .
the eas@@ iest way to download photos on your computer , click on the button and then you will download all photos from their camera to a single album in &amp; digi@@ . . when you downloaded the photos safe in an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you do not want to download all photos , you can only select the desired destination options of &amp; K@@ DE . once you select the photos , use the button . download the button . download the button , until you have selected some photos .
when your camera supports this , an option New download is available . these pictures have now been downloaded from &amp; digi@@ . here . in this case , the new images are marked with a star in the window window . if you select this option , you will be downloaded only the new pictures .
when you can download the buttons All download or Selected combination , a dialog appears to select the target album , where you can read the target album , in which the photos can be found in section My albums , and then select the target album from the list and press OK .
after you have selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ plug ; download the photos from the camera to the album .
as soon as you have downloaded the required photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all of the camera by delete the button . if you only want to delete everything , you must first choose to delete this first and choose Del@@ ete .
note that there are no opportunity to recover from the camera that you will be deleted from the camera . you should not be deleted from the camera . if you want to delete the camera , you should make this camera over the camera , because it &apos;s much faster than the camera .
cameras are often used as fil@@ en@@ ames for the photos often . the fil@@ en@@ ames are often util@@ ized , after taking photos from the camera . this may be useful to integrate photos from different recording criteria . therefore it can be useful to integrate the date and time to integrate the fil@@ en@@ ame in the fil@@ en@@ ame .
in the next section you will find options for turning and mirrors on the picture and for the date , if you use this latter option , automatically create a folder per day .
the options During the transmission will open three more options to be performed before the photos on the panel are stored on the panel . if you want to select the corresponding entries from the EX@@ IF data into the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option , you can correct date &amp; time for any downloaded pictures .
if you wish to use a different file format than the standard format , you can use the pre@@ fix Photo - % Y@@ - % m@@ - % H : % M . use the option date &amp; time . for more adjustments , you should read the help of command @-@ time .
if you use the option camera fil@@ en@@ ame , you have the possibility to change the fil@@ en@@ ame in lower@@ case . or in upper@@ case , if you prefer this .
the new fil@@ en@@ ame , the &amp; digi@@ plug ; used for a photo is displayed below the name that the camera will be available in preview . your settings for ren@@ aming are saved and automatically used when you open the camera window .
and digi@@ plug ; may use all information about the orientation of camera to time recording , to do not all cameras set this information . in section side@@ bar met@@ ad@@ ata , you can read further details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo .
the automatic rotation is normally switched on , and if your camera will not supply these information , &amp; digi@@ plug ; the photo in the original orientation . if you turn off automatically turn off , use the kno@@ b and select the Automatic rotation in the lower part of the window .
if your camera has been made information about the date you have made &amp; digi@@ .@@ This sub@@ species are based on image data . all pictures with the same date are uploaded to the same sub @-@ album . in section side@@ bar met@@ a data you can read what information your camera may have embedded in the photos .
this option is normally off , and in this case &amp; digi@@ plug . if you want to change this option , use this option . if you want to change this option , use the button on the lower end of the window .
the eas@@ iest way to upload photos from your computer to your camera is the button . choose the file selection dialog &amp; K@@ DE , where you can select the files uploaded . you can also select more than a file with the standard &amp; K@@ DE ; methods .
after the image selection is done , asks &amp; digi@@ plug . you can wh@@ i@@ ther the pictures will be loaded too . select the folder selection dialog . select the folder and press OK to start the upload . the pictures will not be deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Positi@@ oning System ) is a general term used in this document . this is a position that can be displayed on a map and can be displayed on a map . the identification of the data can be performed by American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European Galileo or any other system .
not only for professional photograph@@ ers , it can be interesting to link a picture of precise ge@@ ographic place . non @-@ use , an area can use an area through automatic recording of GPS data . environmental plann@@ er , military , police , architectural office and property interests can use this ability .
if you &apos;ve forgotten later , where the photo was made , you can open a browser that shows the area . if you want to register a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ ous ; users will send you to the location of the photos , or simply to document this aspect , it is good to record the position data of a photos .
the question is how to get the GPS data into the image ? first , you should know that ex@@ iv@@ 2 are many GPS data fields , such as direction , saddle and map files . directly with the correct hardware , via a re@@ working of the GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module to the geographical mapping ( manual ) and last about the manual input of known places .
as far as we know there is currently no camera that has a GPS unit , but there is a few who work with GPS receivers together . either as a card module or through transmission of the data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye iP@@ A@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DSLR Ric@@ oh Pro G3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ p@@ sman or g@@ pp . you need to save this data in G@@ P@@ X format , because this is the only format that is supported by the module to geographical mapping .
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that extracts the data of pictures and from the GPS . on the following page you can extract the same under &amp; Linux ; : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the length and lat@@ itudinal and other data , then you can use this script that works with the ex@@ if@@ ted tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the sign @-@ based coordinates , such as map@@ s.@@ google .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com shows no European street maps . here are some European pages , at least in French , German and Spanish , show all navigation details for Europe .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; tries to give you much control of his work processes as possible . in order to access this settings , you have to set up in the menu settings ; you can choose between these settings , by clicking on the symbols of the left side .
promotion can select setting preview video editing or image editing . you set the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ plug ; fixed if you click on an entry in the main screen .
this page contains as shown below , the stand @-@ did@@ actic and ur@@ gent data . these data will be automatically selected to the respective IP@@ TC data fields . the data synchron@@ ization are written in the IP@@ TC fields .
car titles is a syn@@ onym for the author : this field should contain the professional drawing of photograph@@ ers , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a more detailed description of the Autor@@ feld , this must be also filled .
publisher is a syn@@ onym for suppliers : do not use this field to specify the picture . this means that these organisations should be entered here as such as Reuters or Associated Press ; if the image is a storage photo , then the group or agency that is available here should be shown here .
the IP@@ TC @-@ promotions will store the data into the respective IP@@ TC rim . therefore , the met@@ ad@@ ata is permanently contained in the picture and not only available in the database of &amp; digi@@ .@@ This met@@ ad@@ ata is also available to other programs and can be imported ; imported without lost .
image clips ( J@@ F@@ IF ) in JPEG pictures : this synchron@@ izes the comments that you can add to your photos , with which included in the images . attention : in images , which already contained sh@@ ri@@ vals , they will be over@@ written through the digi@@ ous images .
the page settings contains all the options for the information that appear when the mouse has rests in the main window over a file . according to the selected option , this information is displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ plug ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats ; to be specified , you can add the file expan@@ sions to this list and have shown . any file stored in a &amp; digi@@ as ; Alb@@ um@@ my , which has no one of these extensions ; it was ig@@ no@@ red by &amp; digi@@ .
the default settings can be reset to re@@ locate the button and press the button right from each category .
the settings of the lumin@@ ance of &amp; digi@@ plug ; can be set on this site if you are switched on . some pictures have however different sizes and synchron@@ ous mode , you should only use different sizes and synchron@@ ous mode . if you have one , then you can get better visibility results .
by default , the image processing has a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can turn off this here . you can turn off the tool@@ bar in full screen mode .
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of the image can be marked with dark or light color in the picture . these colors are set here . in the image processing , this apparent field can be switched on with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
the Chro@@ ma Sub@@ sampling is meant that the images are encoded in a higher resolution of lumin@@ ance than in the color information . please read this article in Wikipedia to the detailed explanation .
with setting P@@ NG compres@@ sing , you can reduce the size of P@@ NG @-@ files . this operation reduces the image data , because P@@ NG use a loss@@ less algorithm . if you set a fast computer , you can set this value to a high compression . thus , 1 : a low and 9 is a high compression rate .
using the TIFF @-@ files , you can comp@@ ress the de@@ fl@@ ate file algorithm for TIFF images . this reduces the size of the TIFF @-@ images . it has no influence on the image quality , because the deci@@ ph@@ ate algorithm is loss @-@ free .
with the loss @-@ loss JPEG 2000 files you can save a loss . even if you have not yet been able to save the loss of loss and file size far better than the normal JPEG . when this paragraph was written , met@@ ad@@ ata was not yet supported but was in the planning stage .
in previous versions of &amp; digi@@ plug ; image processing was only a picture viewer for photos . currently , it is currently developing a tool to manip@@ ulating your photos . with this dialogue , you can change the image editing .
the default volume is that all green pixels are equally identical to ultra@@ violet light than the pixels of od@@ dities of ultra@@ violet light , this option creates a bit soft , elimin@@ ates the 2x@@ 2 grid @-@ patterns with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method .
when this option is set , the bald is used on the camera . otherwise , if set , the automatic colour balance is used .
this setting is only used when the white off is not set . standard is a fixed color balance that was photograph@@ ed on a white map that was photograph@@ ed in the sunlight .
this setting is supported only for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SLR cameras . the use of the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed photos in four steps more details in the top @-@ top . for other cameras this option gets ig@@ no@@ red .
the standard is the top @-@ top , so the parts of your images are reflected as pier@@ cing white with the im@@ pot@@ ency of your camera . at least do you use the brigh@@ ter in various ros@@ ette . last@@ ly , you can try to recon@@ struct some parts of missing information from top @-@ tops .
this is possible because blue pixels generally do not satisfy as fast as green and red . &amp; digi@@ plug . and d@@ cra@@ w try to recon@@ struct the lack of green and red shar@@ ks from the still not saturated blue pixels . of course , this is a question , how much color or white you want .
if you select the option , you get the possibility to set up a level . here is a value of three a compromise and can therefore be adjusted individually for any image .
put the L@@ umin@@ ance value to your taste . you must probably make it slightly higher than the standard 1 . this can also be made later in the image options of &amp; digi@@ plug ; to hold the time for the icing icing , you should be able to be conservative .
a dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to recover a complete picture from the partial image sensor that will have many cameras and is known as CF@@ A Inter@@ pol@@ ation or color construction .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; and D@@ cra@@ w set you three alternatives at your disposal : Bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number from gra@@ dient ) . it produces Far@@ bar@@ te@@ facts on the edges . Bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting if you are looking for a fast solution with an acceptable result .
if you know the color fr@@ ing@@ ing of your l@@ ent@@ ils you can set the red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for a colour correction , as you can conversion during the shell conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions as these can be returned . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ s ; information like color information of a color space in the others are transl@@ ating as accur@@ ately as possible .
behavior questions if a picture is opened in picture processing / color adjustment module with raw files .
color Profile box lets you click here the folder , such as / us@@ r / share / color / or / or / .@@ color / ICC where you all your profile store . &amp; digi@@ plug ; investigated this folder then during the start .
settings of ICC profiles are here the possibility &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profile . everything can be changed when opening the shell file later .
the colour management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Arg@@ y@@ ll . here are only your pictures and does not manage the entire screen .
the input profiles should be set to the camera manufacturer and the model which you are using . not all profiles are contained in the same way . currently , d@@ cra@@ w Gamma is not included for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means that you need to perform the color mapping itself .
there are more options such as the Soft @-@ Pro@@ of @-@ profile which you can easily print off the image of a device as your printer can work back as your camera and some colors are therefore very satisfied , rather than to leave on the blind algorithm of your printer .
for most cameras it is pretty obvious what colour profile is provided for them . unfortunately , a table of cameras and profiles do not fit together here . this answer is of course un@@ official :
the Canon pro@@ filing extension leaves the style for the target : F for an accurate style , L for landscapes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for portrait and S for standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; K@@ DE ; image plug@@ in interface . it &apos;s an interface which is supported by a series of &amp; K@@ DE ; image manip@@ ulation and image processing is supported ; many modules support which are written to collabor@@ ate with each program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you can see a list of available modules . you will see the list of the available modules , and they will then be downloaded from &amp; digi@@ . these modules will appear as new entries in the menu of the master window and in addition you will find some in the context menu of the preview window .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; short commands for tasks that can be carried out by modules can set manually in the menu under adjustments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for more information ( in English ) over K@@ IP@@ I modules , you can get through the K@@ IP@@ I project under h@@ tt@@ p : / / www.@@ k@@ ip@@ i @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the Di@@ ash@@ au should be easy to understand . the upper kno@@ b adjust@@ s the time between the image inputs , normally 4 @-@ 5 seconds is good . the other check boxes switches the met@@ ad@@ ata or out which are embedded in the bottom end of the images during the ad .
the camera properties show on the left side a list of all cameras supported . on the right side , you try to make sure that the camera is connected properly , switched on and in image display mode . currently , the port@@ als are currently connected , USB@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage .
at the bottom end you can choose the path for USB and Fire@@ Wire cameras ( IEEE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) . this field will only be active if you need a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera . you have to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera , and you need to insert on your camera .
to use your digital camera &amp; digi@@ plug ; you need to connect the camera to your computer , and place them in the display mode .
try out whether &amp; digi@@ plug ; the camera automatically det@@ ects this camera . if not , you can set camera models and port manually after you set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera .
you can select any name for your camera . it is displayed in the menu cameras of the master window . if you own more than one camera , you can insert it here .
with the option confirmation dialog for the shift of &gt; images in the tr@@ ash@@ able display , you can adjust the conversation of &amp; digi@@ s ; when del@@ etion of a photos in an album , you will find further details on the del@@ etion of a photos and er@@ asing of a album .
the editorial changes due to the right side bar can be shut down by &amp; digi@@ ous ; if you use the option to apply in the right side@@ bar without feedback . otherwise , you have to keep the changes with the button changes .
you can also bind the display of the welcome screen of &amp; digi@@ plug ; when starting to start , this will accelerate the starting grid and disp@@ ense .
the setting Bei@@ m Start after new photos are for@@ cing &amp; digi@@ ous albums / photos . this pro@@ lon@@ ging the launch time of &amp; digi@@ ous albums . this pro@@ lon@@ gs the start time of &amp; digi@@ ous albums . if something from the base folder is going , she asks &amp; digi@@ ly , you will be able to er@@ ase them out of the database .
different color schem@@ as can be found in &amp; digi@@ ; to custom@@ ize the main window to your taste . this settings can select below settings design from the tool@@ bar . a preview of available designs will be listed below :
these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you interested in a new design for &amp; digi@@ s , you will find more information about this tutorial in this tutorial .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; contains a fast image processing with some basic tools . you can view this to preview your photos and improve the image processing by one click with the left mouse button to preview the preview and selection of the entry advertisement / edit .
the picture processing contains a number of tools to improve your images . some of these are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ s ; so you are not part of your distribution . for more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules can be found in the image processing section .
a status line at the bottom edge of the window , the fil@@ en@@ ame , current fil@@ en@@ ame , magni@@ fication factor , and the current image size .
a menu bar at the top edge and including the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most common functions .
the processing functions of image editing change your photos . however , the original photo will be changed , before you use File Save or button Save out of the tool@@ bar . note that you can &apos;t recover the original photo - as soon as you have saved the image .
you should ev@@ oke a copy of your image before you change it . you can save it with file Save as if possible .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original screen by re@@ produce the image editing pane in the tool@@ bar . you then lose any change that you have been carried out in the photo since the last store .
nearly every action of image processing can be rec@@ alled or recovered . the last promotion can re@@ vo@@ ke you by editing or recovered from the menu by editing the menu .
if you &apos;re using this , you should make the short@@ cut short , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ z to re@@ produce and remove C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Shift Z to restore .
if you select the &amp; L@@ MB ; you can switch off the back@@ drop or restore button in the tool@@ bar for a moment , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all promotions are also reproduced or recovered .
once you started the picture processing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same key@@ word by clicking the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , image , r@@ ath or the entries in the menu file . if you have any changes to the current photo , you will be asked if you want to save this .
you can fall in the photo and check out in which you use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel or symbols in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the saf@@ est menu .
to custom@@ ize a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : select a magni@@ fication factor
view Full Screen Mode display the photo in full screen mode . if you do not wish to use the tool bar in which you can &apos;t like this . if you do not want this , you can retri@@ eve it from the &amp; digi@@ s ; main window . see the section to set the image processing .
if you want to print the current picture you can print in the menu image below and get the default &amp; K@@ DE , printer dialog . you can custom@@ ize the settings before you can print your photo .
from the main menu , you can print individual images or whole sentences . all the images can choose from your choice . you only need to select the pictures with the default methods and follow the menu album Export Pressure assist@@ ent . if you follow the assistant , you just need to make your choice .
the &amp; digi@@ ous window appeared ; the window has a side bar at the right edge , which provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same side@@ bar is available without navigation use . it is displayed if one of the five riders is clicked :
multiple Click on the same rider , the side@@ bar will appear and disappear again in the rim .
in the vent view , you can enter sh@@ ri@@ ft@@ on with unlimited size or insert . the text is UTF @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters can be copied to EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC@@ - Fields , so that you can use other programs .
the IP@@ TC data are only limited to ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut off after 2000 characters . if you want to use the IP@@ TC labelling field in other applications , you should be considered to be observed .
after you commented on , use either the button or switch to the next image , which will then be stored .
besides the user button there is a button More . with this you can read further met@@ ad@@ ata from the selected file or database . however , this is always carried out if you have selected a met@@ ad@@ ata setting , which is always written in the pictures .
the section rating shows an assessment scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in searching and sorting areas . it can always be used to evaluate several images at the same time . in order to evaluate several images at the same time , select this out and use the context menu .
the evaluation is written in the IP@@ TC field . the coding follows the scheme in the following table :
the search view shows a search box for fil@@ tering the pass@@ words , the sampling and a selection box with previously mentioned in this &amp; digi@@ ous words ; session requested stit@@ ches .
the sampling system is adjusted according to the specified search phr@@ ase . you can quickly restri@@ ct the number of possibilities in search of a key@@ word . this ability is especially useful if you have many keywords .
the input field at the lower end is a further relief during the input of keywords with a picture series . if you have entered different keywords , they are saved for quick access .
keywords can also be set by mark@@ er the respective check boxes in the tree . all keywords are saved in the IP@@ TC field key@@ word .
if several pictures are selected in the main screen and select a key@@ word in the sample tree , this will only be applied to the entire selection , if you want a selection with a key@@ word , please read the sampling filter section .
the sampling filter is used to alter the selection of images shown in the main window . usually , the left side bar is used with their album , - data , search , search and search results . if additionally , one or more sampling filters will be used . all created pass@@ words are available .
you can also drag and drop them . if the key@@ word is already exists , you can simply drag and set aside . if the key@@ word is already exists , you can simply drag and set aside . if the key@@ word is already exists , you can simply move it out of the right side@@ bar . then a dialog appears that you want to set the key@@ word .
in the upper example shows the images on one calendar day . the sample filters will be reduced to three pictures . they have been selected with Str@@ g + a and later it was put off . a dialog asks if this key@@ word is to be set .
this search for changes takes place at any start of the program . it can also be used without any settings .
if you have a rule with and created and notice that it should be one or its , you can easily change this easily with a double click on the text and in the control area .
( 1 ) : the entry to which in the database is sought . this may be an album , name , key@@ word , image , key@@ word , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or a string that is already set in the database .
for example , you can define a Extended search for all the elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to group@@ ed options , you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule , and then use the button . the options then look as follows :
why were Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Fli@@ ck@@ r are not listed ? the free storage space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the pictures in full resolution .
this article / tutorial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I mainly used it &amp; digi@@ s ; s concrete implementation .
the reason why you set a color@@ ized workflow . with a color@@ able workflow , you can achieve that the colors on your monitor can be found on your monitor or scanner same and the colors printed you or on the web , which correspond to them from your digital dark chamber .
if the theme is coming on color management , everyone wants to press what buttons are to press for the results which he would like to give you an adequate background information about color administration . additionally , you should make links with deeper information enable your own inform@@ al decisions to make your desired result .
if your image work@@ flows fulfilled all the criteria specified at the bottom , you do not need to worry about color management .
they are calibr@@ ated on a monitor that can be calibr@@ ated on the s@@ RGB colour space . ( please find further information below )
your only other image expend@@ itu@@ res are via e @-@ mail or web , where s@@ RGB of de @-@ fac@@ to standard is .
so , if s@@ RGB doing so well and the life for all so easy , why should one use another colour space and therefore need to make thoughts about color bl@@ oss@@ oms ?
a visual example of s@@ RGB in comparison to the colors we can really see below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors which we can see is the hu@@ u@@ rous region , and the colors in the RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger farms , see Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ om page and then click information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I have to watch my monitor , if I have decided to work only in the RGB color space ?
Yes ! if you are working in the s@@ RGB color space , or do not you need to create your monitor . when you have RGB at s@@ RGB , then you need to use their monitor at s@@ RGB , then you need to use either your monitor on the s@@ RGB standard , a matching monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions to improve the image in most cases . use it therefore before you try to try a further manual processing .
the functions normal@@ ization , the same , automatic sealing and contrast extend from the menu , automatically try to make the best automatically out of your colors . you will have to experiment with these effects , to see what is best in your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method sc@@ aled against the whole image , so that the dark point black and the brigh@@ test point so bright as possible without any color orientation . this function is often a magnetic correction for pictures of dark or balanced .
the same method adjust@@ s the lumin@@ osity of the colors of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity is so flat as possible . thereby , the same very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it produces even rub@@ b@@ ish . it is a very powerful operation that causes either miracles by a picture or it was destroyed .
automated driving : this method maxim@@ izes the color range in red , green and blue channel . it determin@@ es the dark and bright border shades and adjust@@ s the red , green and blue channels on the entire hist@@ o@@ gramm@@ atical range .
contrast extends : this method improves the contrast and lumin@@ osity of the RGB values of a picture through the highest possible area and a new ji@@ re@@ ation of all values between . this is only visible at balanced images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white @-@ cut off &amp; digi@@ plug ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photos .
the bald correction is a bit limited because of a colour space with 8 @-@ bit per color . if you are going to be far away from the original screen , if you can perform white bal@@ ancing in the raw mode , which will perform in 16 @-@ bit mode , so your possibilities will improve for correction better .
this tool is based on a tin@@ ent algorithm that is protected by copyright of Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ora . it will start on the menu entry colours white ab@@ normal@@ ization of image processing .
the front window can be adjusted in size . on the left side , both the original image is adapted to the preview of the tool . if you want to see the original wh@@ it@@ ish immediately , it is enough to click the lower window .
the preview of the target photos has a red mark@@ er . the lumin@@ ance of the Pix@@ els under this mark@@ er is indicated as vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
on the right above , a hist@@ ogram , so soon as you change a parameter , the hist@@ ogram is very helpful , most pixels very small L@@ umin@@ ance values . with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum will appear . the sum will be called L@@ umin@@ ance .
the contrast of your result depends on sh@@ adows , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . the sh@@ adows allows you to improve the sh@@ utt@@ ings of your photos or even down .
An@@ stat with the above inspec@@ tions , you should use the colour temperature pip@@ ette . press on this button and then anywhere in the preview for calcul@@ ating the colour temperature of the white balance . on this type , the temperature and green values are automatically set .
in addition , you can reset the white balance with the list of default settings . the following settings are available :
the coatings @-@ dict@@ ator increases the colors when more than a color channel of the Pix@@ els is exposed .. you will get the combined result in a white indicator . this is shown in preview of a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
buttons Save as and load exactly that . each attitude of the white @-@ equivalent you can set you in a text file and re@@ load later .
the button def@@ aults def@@ aults to their standard values and the corresponding neutral white @-@ balance . note that the neutral settings will be shown another photo than your original . if you save them , your original image will be changed .
you can adjust the plates per color channel of the processed image . 8 @-@ bit encoding is far better suited to high quality images . this coding is better suited for high quality images . this coding is also only available for high quality images , and stands only for the formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , TIFF , and D@@ NG .
this tool gives the same dialog such as the processing of images . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . color mapping can be carried out by the sub@@ window for the use of colour profiles . a detailed guidance for the use of colour profiles can withdraw the text colour management .
another important tool is available in the menu under the same color correction . this tool provides an integrated way to set up several color channels simultaneously , so you can always make the same mist@@ akes and you always need the same correction . in the manual to the sound correction , you will find more information .
a very powerful possibility of exposure to correct is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find under gra@@ dation in the menu .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool colour effects depic@@ ts four colour effects , a solar effect effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and an edge filter available .
in times of the chemical processing , Solar@@ isation , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , was a effect of the additional light . this result was the effect that the brigh@@ ter areas dar@@ ker and the colors were inver@@ ted by the second lighting . the result was a part negative of the picture . this tool allows you to fine this interesting effect fine .
the intensity controls the solar panels . at approx . 50 % intensity , the image shows what chemical is possible . another increase is finally a negative picture that is not so on photo paper .
this is an example of the solar output effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the technique ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vi@@ d filters sim@@ ulates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it distingu@@ ishes itself from a satur@@ ation that he makes a stronger contra@@ sting effect given the colours and makes it easy , he emb@@ ell@@ ished many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for a transparent color film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film ; the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ as many saturated colours and high contrast , but also some photograph@@ ers , especially those of which are hardly noticeable , too much .
the ne@@ on filter sim@@ ulates ne@@ on@@ light on the contrast @-@ edges . the parameter level controls the brightness of the ne@@ on@@ light . at large images , the filter can g@@ rope the whole CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it &apos;s not un@@ usually that you want to correct the colour contrast and the lumin@@ osity of the photos in the menu . all your alignment can be found in preview . once you are satisfied with the result , use the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
if you make a photo of bad lighting conditions , you can reduce the converted problem : one to large satur@@ ation . also in this case , the tool is able to reduce satur@@ ation . all modifications can be seen in preview . if they do the result , you can confirm the changes to O@@ k .
between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple leu@@ k@@ tens@@ ile strength / contrast / Gamma is set the tool to improve exposure . even if the dialog for this tool is very complicated , you need for the application of the sli@@ der . concrete the three shooting down below the hist@@ ogram .
the window contains a graph of intensity values , an hist@@ ogram , the active can@@ als or the selected area . under the graph , three sli@@ ders can be mounted into the image and the left side represents the dark and right side the bright areas .
the eas@@ iest way to learn the control is to shift the kno@@ b and to mind how the image changes .
on the right side can be viewed the original and preview of the picture . the preview will be dynamic , using the settings of the picture , updated . on the left , the following options are available .
sc@@ aling : with this selection box can be adjusted if the hist@@ ogram with a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic Y axis is frequently represented . in pictures the large areas of a constant colour is dominated by a single column . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic classification is useful .
three controllers : the top for the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the bottom for the medium sounds frequently called Gam@@ ma@@ c .
the three color @-@ pin@@ ching can be used in preview of the original image to automatically adjust the inputs of the shade , medium and bright tones automatically . furthermore there is a button for a fully automatic alignment .
output : the output value allows you to select a selection of manual values for each area . there are also two switches that can be used to evaluate the output rate . for example , the compression of the output file can be used e.g. to create something different in the background during something different .
automatically : with this kno@@ b the image values will be automatically set in dependence on the image values .
save as and load : with these buttons , the set values can be stored in the file system and then loaded again . Gim@@ p levels is used .
if you use this mode and the three paint spra@@ yers , the inputs will automatically be adjusted automatically for all sh@@ adows , means and solar tones , and click the preview of the original image for rot@@ ational , green , blue , blue and L@@ umin@@ ous channels .
the option of over@@ exposure dict@@ ator controls all color channels to view over@@ exposed pixel and to give you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it &apos;s no effect on the final results .
below is an example of the alignment of the inputs applied to red , green and blue channel of a photos . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output effects remain unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the correct picture ( 2 ) .
on the left side , half of the original and the target picture is displayed , dynam@@ ically updated depending on your settings . the following options are available on the right side :
Modification channel : this selection box allows the channel to be changed from the module :
apart from that box there are two symbols between a linear and log@@ arith@@ m@@ apped view . for images that have been recorded with a wide digital camera , linear mode produces a wide beam in linear mode . in this case , log@@ arith@@ mic mode helps in this case .
for example , if you move to the right , e.g. the bright sounds , then you can see that these bright sounds can be correspon@@ dent and corresponding to the associated image pixels .
on the preview of the original photos is a red mark to see . if you want to change this mark in the range you want to change the original value . create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste .
save as and load : with these buttons you can do exactly this . every curve you can have created in the file system and then loaded , the file format is the Gim@@ p curve format .
if you create this method and the three paint spra@@ yers , you automatically want to use the control points of the curve for all channels of the sh@@ ade@@ - , medium and solar tones . check the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve .
the option of over@@ exposure dict@@ ator controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . in more than a channel over@@ loaded pixels , you get the combined result . this is an indicator that you can view the effect only in preview and it &apos;s no effect on the final results .
below you can see a black @-@ and @-@ white photo that was corrected in the L@@ umin@@ ous channel . sh@@ ade@@ - and sun@@ flower tones was applied with the ep@@ ip@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the correct ( 2 ) .
the Channel Mi@@ xer of &amp; digi@@ plug ; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the shades of the photos .
the channel mixer is a further developed tool for mixing the shades of the images . you can process it from the menu @-@ channel mixer image processing .
with the channel selection box , select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first note as you can correct the channels by showing the relative distribution and r@@ ash . the left section of the window displays a preview . the original can be viewed by comparison over the own rider .
the preview of the target image has a red mark@@ er . if you set this in the image , a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram to display the corresponding color value .
the controls for the module are right down : kno@@ b for red , green and construction allows you to activate these channels . if you also use this option of Mon@@ och@@ rome , as the Channel Mi@@ xer is able to produce a great black @-@ and @-@ white conver@@ sions of your photos . try the green channel for black @-@ and @-@ white portraits .
sometimes , especially when you mix mon@@ och@@ rome , leads the reduction of a colour to a visible noise that occur from far@@ brau@@ schen . when this is the case , you can improve your mon@@ och@@ rome conversion through which you first reduce the colour@@ less .
the Save as and store buttons are used exactly to this purpose . any mixer setting allows you to save and then load . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel audio format .
the option of over@@ exposure dict@@ ator controls all color channels to view over@@ exposed pixel and to give you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it &apos;s no effect on the final results .
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel was re @-@ adjusted . the option L@@ umin@@ ance is enabled . the original image is listed below ( 1 ) and the illustrated picture below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography was always fascinating because of your off@@ ence . with the development of digital photography is black / white a work step because paint images can be easily converted on the computer . also with a set of film rolls profiles .

green filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white background exposure using a green lens filter . this looks good for all scenarios and fits especially well to portraits against the sky . so similar to 004 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) green filter .
Oran@@ tes : sim@@ ulates a black / white background exposure using an orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , marine scenes and aerial photos . so similar to 002 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Oran@@ tes .
rot@@ ates : sim@@ ulates a black / white background exposure with a red lens filter . this creates a dramatic high @-@ level effects and can sim@@ ulate lun@@ ar @-@ balance to the daily time . so similar to 003 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) rot@@ ates .
yellow filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white background exposure with an yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) yellow filter .
Sep@@ os@@ on : generates warm bright and medium shades while adding a bit col@@ dness in the sh@@ ear . this is typical for the photos of your grand@@ mother and that similar to the 005 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
using the digi@@ plug ; tool texture , you can apply decor@@ ative tex@@ tures to a picture .
Adding a texture to your picture , regardless of whether it is a color picture or not , you can look like a wall painting on a screen , the sticker of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a wall picture at a wall . the menu entry picture texture can be used for it .
relief : post@@ p@@ one this parameter to the right the depth of the depth and three @-@ dimensional texture .
a paper tex@@ tual effect is applied on the picture below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the modified ( 2 ) . the relief is set to 200 .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool frame can be added to a decorative frame to be added a picture .
the eye of an consider@@ ations in the limits of a photos is no easy task . to maintain its attention . this is a psychological barrier for scatter@@ ing eye . under the frame , the module can be started from the image processing .
type : with this parameter you set the desired frame type for your image . through a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white images ) , it cuts a decorative frame with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame and decor@@ atively adds a decorative frame with pattern .
width : specifies the frame width in percent . the value range for the width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
that with the frame of decorated target image will be bigger than the original but the same aspect ratio . this is important for the printing of images , especially if you have used the tool in case of aspect ratio .
with this practical tool , you can insert simple @-@ format text in any image on any part . it also goes on several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply type the text and place it with the mouse . do you use text size , the larger must be the character set . at the end , simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background . finally , the picture is finished .
each setting , which you have chosen for your text can be changed until you have been changed to &quot; OK &quot; button . after the image has been saved once , the text part of the image is changed . it cannot be changed .
with the digi@@ plug ; tool template apply you can put a template over a picture .
the Menu Photo Templ@@ ate Apply into image processing can be used to put templates over a picture .
for templates , there are no restrictions concerning the size and orientation . you need to add the P@@ NG file format and should you want to add your template &apos;s file size , so you just send an e @-@ mail in English to &amp; digi@@ .@@ mail@@ ing@@ list digi@@ re @-@ users @ k@@ de.@@ org ..
if you are using this tool for first time you need to put your sten@@ cil folder with the button base folder in dialog . select the folder where you will be copied to the folder . these settings will be noted for the next start .
after the root folder for the template has been made a building that reflects the folder of the sten@@ cil printer . the selection of a folder will be updated automatically .
below the preview you can find three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fying factor and position of your image .
Enlarge : this kno@@ b increases the dar@@ lying image . it is cent@@ ered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
smaller : this kno@@ b resi@@ zed this button . in order to adjust the position of the mouse . if you want to adjust the template onto the whole image , you need to sc@@ roll the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move them : use this button to move the image below the template . take the image and place it on the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template onto your picture . the image will then be adjusted automatically .
&amp; digi@@ came ; provides three different tools for shar@@ pen@@ ing . each of you have benefits in other areas .
shar@@ pen@@ ing is a traditional tool for shar@@ pen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy , but especially in dark areas , gra@@ ined pictures .
fil@@ ming mask will look at the contrast of the edges in order to look sharp . it &apos;s really sharp@@ ly , it works rather psych@@ ovis@@ ual . you can use it just a really good job . the algorithm was taken out of Gim@@ p and it is protected by copyright of Win@@ ston Chang .
it is possibly the best of the three , since it really improved the sharp@@ ness . it is a bit more complicated in its application and has various parameters to adapt .
photos without focus , most digit@@ alised images need a correction of the sharp@@ ness . this means that the dig@@ iti@@ zation process paints can be printed along with just minimum differences when colour highlights are printed on paper . SLR cameras usually require better known as normal cameras for the home user .
JPEG pictures , JPEG pictures , a camera frequently has been applied for internal carbide images . images in the shell format are always enabled to be tigh@@ tened in the processing .
some ads have a shar@@ pen@@ ing filter already during the reading of the picture . if you dis@@ able this dis@@ able , you get control of your image .
in some situations , you can get usable results by shar@@ pen@@ ing a photo with the shar@@ pen@@ ing mode . you can correct the menu entry .
you should be careful not to handle the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but ampli@@ fies the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but ampli@@ fies the sharp@@ ness of the image . in general , you will find further information on the menu entry . you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for shar@@ pen@@ ing .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too tight . the solution to correct it is much easier than it . using the menu entry , and experiment the tool on the right side of the dialog box showing the effect on your photo .
the filter un@@ sharp is a very good tool to remove mu@@ zzle from your photos . you can see this demonstration here .
the original image and preview can help edit the image . the show@@ case shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often produce good results and should first test the effect . if you create the shar@@ pen@@ ed mask , are smo@@ ked and the impression of grass in the vicinity of sharp edges .
the radius represents a lot of pixels on each side of a edge by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . you should therefore shar@@ pen@@ ed images best in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the wi@@ ped image which is added to the original . thus , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
the sw@@ elling value is a fra@@ ction from the maximum RGB value and the difference of the filters . this way , areas with a soft change between killing of shar@@ pen@@ es and therefore beauty faul@@ ts are avoided in faces , Himm@@ ler and water surface .
this is an example of the un@@ sharp over@@ turned filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . un@@ sharp mask was applied with a radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0 .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool will focus on a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copyright protected un@@ folding filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries an image to &amp; quot ; re@@ focal frequency . this is better to try the photo . it uses a technology called F@@ IR Vien@@ nese film . it is used to use a technology called F@@ IR Vien@@ nese film . it can only use better results than bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ ks . you can start it from the menu by using colors Re@@ fo@@ k .
in practice , the circular flow is much better than the Gau@@ ge &apos;s split into a very long tail , which leads far from the original pixel pixels , which is far influenced by far from the original size pixel . most cases even highly strongly influenced by remote pixels . this causes undes@@ irable results .
circular flow rate : this is the most important parameters for the use of this module . for most of the images , the default value should be 1 good results . you can set a higher value when your image is very un@@ sharp , but then on the sanctuary .
correlation : the correlation can help reduce ar@@ te@@ facts . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . the correlation is 0.5 and the values close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0,@@ 95 and 0,@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the sharp@@ est effect of the module .
Rau@@ sch@@ filter : an increase in the filter filter can help you reduce ar@@ te@@ facts . however , values higher than 0,1 can be very rare . if the noise filter is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 the image quality is very poor . a good value is 0,@@ 03 . a high value is still to contamination .
Gau@@ ge &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the Gau@@ ge &apos;s sharp@@ ness . in most cases , you should use this value to 0 to avoid anno@@ ying ar@@ te@@ facts . if you use a value equal to zero , you may also increase the correlation and / o@@ der@@ y noise filter .
Mat@@ ri@@ zen@@ size : this value determin@@ es the size of the transformation matrix . however , if you choose large numbers for circular sharp@@ ness or the Gau@@ ge &apos;s sharp@@ ness . note the module is very slow when you choose large values for this parameter . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
the Save as and store buttons are used exactly to this purpose . any random parameters will set you that will be saved later and then can be loaded then .
try to execute all trimm@@ ings , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the picture before using the module .
otherwise you should use the module before you change the image . the reason for this is that much operations are not visible immediately , but later un@@ pleasant ar@@ te@@ facts leave .
if you read and comp@@ ress images , &amp; eg ; than JPEG , you should apply the module to un@@ compressed image .
generally , un@@ sharp mas@@ ks produces better results as shar@@ pen@@ ing . this could be caused by un@@ sharp mas@@ ks using a bigger neighborhood as shar@@ pen@@ ing .
theore@@ tically , un@@ sharp mas@@ ks must always generate ar@@ te@@ facts . even under optimum conditions it can never indicate the effect of the F@@ IR Vienna Fil@@ ters always at least as good as the bl@@ ends mask . the F@@ IR Vienna filter is frequently better in processing of small details .
below , you can see a comparison between different filters , on a little un@@ disputed picture :
the original un@@ sharp color image has to be corrected . this image has been taken with an analog@@ ous camera . the un@@ focused result is due to in@@ sufficient light for the car focus lens .
for more information about the methodology of shar@@ pen@@ ance in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English under this address .
the kno@@ b and the sharp@@ ness of the dar@@ ken@@ ess has been dar@@ kened to generate a natural pair of P@@ up@@ ille .
the color tin@@ ned allows the adapted colour for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes rather than dark , then you can adjust this here .
the tool @-@ error correction is one of the most sophisticated tool developed in order to remove un@@ desired arti@@ facts with un@@ parall@@ el@@ os@@ er speed .
In@@ vol@@ algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE Team of the GR@@ EC CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g @-@ Project .
this tool includes various default settings as a starting point to simpli@@ fy the restoration . the available settings are listed below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings , you can use the rider Gl@@ ance and Advanced Settings .
detail conservation &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the conservation of details . a small value leads to a smooth glass of smooth regions and details are sharp . a value of 0.9 should be found so that no shar@@ pen@@ ing should be necessary . please refer to the detailed description of the direction of movement .
direction buffer alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smoo@@ ther evenly into all directions while a value is close to 1 only in one direction . JPEG ar@@ te@@ facts will produce a very high value of similar design . JPEG ar@@ te@@ facts will be best eliminated at a value of 1 .
smoo@@ thing &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum glass factor above all@@ es@@ . p then defines the relative smoo@@ thing . set this value therefore suitable to the degree of smoke in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter concerns greater structures . the higher this value is necessary if it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Gogh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect , it must be higher than 3 .
repet@@ itions : specifies how often the algorithm is gone through . usually goes 1 or 2 .
angle step width &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of the an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic Alpha . if alpha is small chosen , it should also be small to generate a long runtime . you should choose to achieve this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs .
integr@@ ale stri@@ de length &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integr@@ able stri@@ de length in pixels . you should avoid the value smaller than 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixels and never greater than 2 .
linear inter@@ pol@@ ation use : the more of the quality you can receive by selecting this option is low . it doubles the running time . we recommend it to allow him .
the buttons Save as and load exactly that . any adjustment of image error can be corrected in a text file and then re @-@ loaded .
image error correction is compar@@ atively very quick at work . however , it can still last very long and take a high CPU load . you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the kno@@ b .
below , you can see how image error was removed with small arti@@ facts . the module is used on a photo that in Guatemala City was created with an analog camera . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the original image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce image noise . it uses a protected algorithm from Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool is available to selectable image filters , to remove st@@ ains and other ar@@ te@@ facts which can be removed from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or mo@@ or@@ us@@ d ; effects of fed images from books or magazines .
if you need more information about sensors of digital cameras , you can read this tutorial in English at this tutorial .
the screenshot above shows a typical scene that was made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows an gra@@ ined noise that can be removed with this tool .
in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases you need only the sub@@ window details and the bottom @-@ window settings can remain in default settings .
radius is controlled the window size , of 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . large numbers increase the time specified by the radius . the image indicated below the picture and the color in it is sm@@ ooth@@ ed and therefore smaller flaws were adjusted .
sharp@@ ness : adjust@@ s the sharp@@ ness of the filters after the front view of the filters . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter details does not receive any more and noise and rob@@ ber@@ y occurs again .
edges : controls the edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it can be too strong , can &apos;t occur at the maximum , if you want to remove a weak or JPEG ar@@ te@@ facts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance of the image . we recommend either color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings are not impact the smoo@@ ther process of the image .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend either color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings are not impact the smoo@@ ther process of the image .
Gamma : controls the g@@ amm@@ at@@ ol@@ er@@ ance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance levels of the dar@@ ker zones that typically are stronger than increase , but he does also dirty the sh@@ ade@@ areas .
cushi@@ oning : controls the alignment of Ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter@@ d@@ amping . this value defines as quickly the adap@@ tive filter radius on variations of the lumin@@ ance . when he is on his minimum , noise and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter may occur at the edges . it can remove smoke peaks and is the recommended method for this .
save and store : these buttons are used exactly to this . all parameters for bo@@ ilers that you have set can be saved to the file system and then loaded .
this is an example of how smoke production can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the resulting production was applied to the default settings .
sometimes a picture is too tight for your purpose . the solution that make a bit soft than a picture to test , and experim@@ enting with the menu entry , and experiment with the menu entry to the right side of the dialog box showing the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ s came ; photo Restau@@ ration is definitely one of the most sophisticated tools in the wid@@ est developed tools .
this filter for the restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of un@@ wanted arti@@ facts , film gra@@ ins , scrat@@ ches , scrat@@ ches , scrat@@ ches , cr@@ atch , compression ar@@ te@@ facts and local mist@@ akes occurs in digital , original or later dig@@ iti@@ zed images and receives the content as it also makes the human eye .
the same algorithm can be used for paint and tex@@ turing . the tex@@ turing is done with another tool , the error correction was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE Team of the GR@@ EC CN@@ RS Lab in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ é . it is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG Ar@@ te@@ facts reduce : compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far away . as a loss@@ less compression algorithm created some compression &amp; quot ; Ar@@ te@@ facts &amp; quot ; Ar@@ te@@ facts &amp; quot ; - small standards that are visible in un@@ compressed image . this setting should be correct .
the buttons saved as and load this . each setting of photo restau@@ ration can be saved in a text file and will be loaded later .
photo @-@ Restau@@ ration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can still last long and take a high CPU load . you can therefore stop the calculation at any time with the button .
below , the module can be restored as a photo with equ@@ il@@ ical noise . the module is applied to a black and white photo that was detected on a Il@@ ford ( TM ) HP @-@ 5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can see the not@@ ori@@ ous film gra@@ ding of the faces . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the correct tab ( 2 ) .
below , you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time , tex@@ tures can be found on an old colour photo that was shown with a scanner . you can see the scan arti@@ facts and the photo paper . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the correct image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool Hot@@ pixel allows you to remove hot@@ pixel of photos that have been removed with a CCD camera . it uses algorithms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pix@@ i project that are protected by law by Martin Dick@@ p .
bright , t@@ ote or hot pixels are particularly important to high quality raw materials photos , as many cameras with JPEG compression have a built @-@ in oppression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixels ; and &quot; quot ; bright pixels ; on a photo with a dark image sub@@ trac@@ ting method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
download this file in the wi@@ z@@ ard with the button dark image . the tool will automatically identify the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the image detail .
if you have an old digital camera , it &apos;s important to take the dark image directly in the port to discover new hot or bright pixel by CCD def@@ aults .
first , as described in the previous section , you should download the matching dark image to correct image . a automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixel image . note that the assistant re@@ members the last dark image and re@@ loads this automatically in the next meeting .
the image area and preview can help you correct within the image . the show@@ case shows the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are lifted in all screen@@ ings .
choose an area around the defective pixel by preview and the results of the Fil@@ ters . choose the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate this pixel blocks . these are the available filter :
Dur@@ able : it is an average of the neighbouring pixel . the resulting colour is assigned to all defective pixels in block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this will be taken separately for horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a spac@@ ing of 1 pixel pixel are used to calculate a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ D@@ im ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ D@@ im ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
square : this is the default filter method . all pixels with a spac@@ ing of 2 or less to the pixel @-@ block to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ digit ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ D@@ im ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixel .
Kub@@ isch : all the pixels with a distance of 3 or less will be moved to inter@@ pol@@ ate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ digit ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ D@@ im ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixel .
below , you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a colour photo , from a defective digital camera with sensitivity of 200 ISO and long expos@@ ures to see the original image has been increased to 300 % ( 1 ) and the correct picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ comes ; vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the vig@@ net@@ ization , i.e. under@@ exposed ver@@ ti@@ ces , an image .
wide angle lens , especially in the medium and large photo format , often do not illumin@@ ate the entire sensor range . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ ting at which time can reduce the light and reduce the sensor there . teleph@@ oto lens should also show this behaviour .
but he also has dis@@ advantages . many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter , which should be impossible to hold the camera with hand . wide angle lens , also with center filter , an aperture of f / 16 or less , otherwise un@@ predic@@ table effects can arise .
with the great exposure areas of today &apos;s film and color scanner , it is possible to sim@@ ulate the effect of a C@@ enter@@ filter , which without these filters , the transformation with a C@@ enter@@ filter is turned into an image . the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker .
with three shelves you can control the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction filter and with three further expos@@ ures to the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of luminous efficiency at the point of the largest density . the standard density amounts to 2.0 , or by chance to compens@@ ate a luminous intensity of 2 , or by chance to compens@@ ate a greater degree of vig@@ net@@ ization , reduce it to compens@@ ate a small degree .
shock @-@ intensity , contrast and Gamma Settings : the edit the image with the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is reduced the lumin@@ osity of the pixels . you need to re @-@ adjust the image of the target image with these options , because you only have to increase the settings .
if you want a fine new adjustment to expos@@ e the target image , let the values for lumin@@ osity / contrast / Gamma at zero and do you use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ plug ; image processing from the menu color Gra@@ dation .
this is an example of the Vig@@ net@@ ization correction to a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the correct picture in the corners and ( 2 ) the correct image . a table and contrast correction was also done in the image with this tool .
the digi@@ plug comes ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the effect of spher@@ ical lenses to photos . it uses a protected algorithm from David Ho@@ d@@ son .
this tool works with geomet@@ ric distortion . distortion distortion can not be corrected using this tool .
the coefficient of the second degree covers the general geomet@@ rical distortion of the lens and can correct the con@@ cave or the con@@ vex form of the image .
the coefficient of the third degree has a similar round effect , but in the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool .
the coefficient of the fourth degree corrected the remote corners to the second degree . if you combine these two , any geomet@@ rical distortion can be eliminated .
General : this value controls the strength of the distortion part of the second degree . with negative values , K @-@ shaped distortion can be corrected and positive values of c@@ ienti@@ sts distortion .
corner : this value controls the thickness of the distortion part of the edges . this value is stronger than in the center of the image . for most lenses , the &apos; facets parameter was the inver@@ ted mark of the parameter .
zoom : this is sc@@ aled the image size , thereby making a correction of first Gra@@ des by . negative values increase while positive the image .
brigh@@ tening : this value adjust@@ s the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values increase it .
to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog with a preview the distortion error correction . the values you use for your image , are stored and used at the next start as standard values .
the T@@ elecom or c@@ ienti@@ al correction should be performed prior to all cutting or size changes . at best , you perform this correction than any first . if you cut a picture and then make a tonn@@ age correction would be the effect of the Fal@@ se .
to help you find the best correction to help you can view this tool a vertical and horizontal relief line . move the mouse button to fix the lines on this site . in connection , you can correct the component / c@@ ann@@ ular distortion with the help of the lines .
when you correct a c@@ ienti@@ al distortion is correct , the resulting image will be black corners . you can remove them with the cutting tool in the menu and remove the image processing or via the zoom of this dialog .
for most images , the tonn@@ age @-@ shaped correction can be seen . the next logical step for some moti@@ fs such as shots from the front , frame and paintings it is the perspective so that if you hold the camera with your hand , you always will always have a slight distortion of perspective .
this is an example of the K @-@ shaped correction to a church in Norway . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the correct image below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method to sim@@ ulate infrared film of the g@@ lowing belts , the filter re@@ produces the well @-@ known Il@@ ford ( TM ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ infrared film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left hand side of the window , you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rectangle with the mouse , you can consider the effect on different parts of the image .
below the preview you can set two parameters for film gra@@ fts and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . if you sim@@ ulate the gra@@ ined texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO kno@@ bs changes the amount of film green ( chlor@@ ophyll in nature ) in conversion . green meadows will be white as snow !
since the filters colour duc@@ ts are mixed with infrared film , especially the green channel makes it not make sense to apply the effect on black / white photos , as colour information is missing .
this is an example of the infrared fil@@ tering process applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is set under ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values produce a kind of A@@ ura in the top .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter film@@ making is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to re@@ produce film gra@@ zing in your images . this is known by classical high @-@ speed films such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the films , the manufacturer &apos;s large sil@@ els of phot@@ emul@@ sion .
the film gra@@ ined effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . if you want to get a tim@@ eless atmosphere from everyday life . if you want to use this special , gallery @-@ like , road photographic , gra@@ ined view especially in your mon@@ och@@ ro@@ men photos , so you must use this filter .
with the kno@@ b , the ISO sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the gra@@ ins . the default value is , although frequently higher values are needed , to ISO @-@ 2400 . if you still need more body , you can use the filter several times .
this is an example of the film gra@@ ined for a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the modified film sensitivity complies with ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter oil paintings creates the appearance of a oil painting . it uses a protected algorithm from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter oil paintings gives your digital images a nice appearance as the oil painting . natural pictures and styles are good for this effect .
there are two kno@@ b to influence this effect . the upper cho@@ oses the pin size between one and five . th@@ icker brush is better suited for large images . smoo@@ thing to the smoo@@ thing or , from the other hand , the hing@@ es .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the user is marked with ( 2 ) . brush size for this 640 pixel image is 1 and smooth 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter charcoal drawing uses paint and intensity gra@@ dient to create a coal dust . the images whose gra@@ dients vary slowly . it is helpful to imagine what scene you would like to sk@@ ip you . this would be good pictures to capture it .
there are two kno@@ b with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper controller cho@@ oses the pin size and the lower adjust@@ s the contrast ( g@@ ull ) .
this is an example of the charcoal filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity level .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter engraving the image in 3 @-@ D , as if it has been stamped in wax . it uses a protected algorithm from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter engraving is a fast tool to restore your pictures with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works especially well with images with a simple structure , where color does not use the differences between color and intensity to trans@@ form the image in a gray , mon@@ dar@@ ing landscape .
the depth allows you to adjust the contrast of the filtration . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , the default setting .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
using this filter group you can trans@@ form a normal photo in an artwork by distortion effect . it uses legally protected algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : divi@@ des the image in cells and can look it as if it is viewed through glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : analogue to the wave trap 1 the image is distor@@ ted with a different version of glass blocks .
some effects require long time to calculate , generate a high CPU load . you can termin@@ ate this effects at any time with the button .
with this filter group you can trans@@ form a normal photo in an artwork by fil@@ ming effects . it uses legally protected algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom Not@@ ice : wi@@ ped the picture along ster@@ n@@ idal lines take out of a center . this sim@@ ulates a zo@@ om@@ ent camera and thereby generates an dynamic expression of often in sports photography .
radi@@ al infin@@ ity : wi@@ ped the image by rotation of the pixel around a center . this sim@@ ulates the im@@ itation of a rotating camera .
distances : wi@@ ped the picture to generate the effect of a non @-@ focused com@@ promising camera . the object seems to come back to the background .
motion @-@ shar@@ k : wi@@ ped the image by horizontal movement of pixels . this sim@@ ulates the un@@ sharp@@ ness of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or by train , camera .
soft pop @-@ sharp@@ ness : wi@@ ped the picture soft to dark tones . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , gl@@ amour @-@ photos or to add a warm and sub@@ tle light .
sh@@ ook @-@ shar@@ per : distor@@ ted the image by acci@@ dental shift of pixels and sim@@ ulates the sharp@@ ness of an arbitr@@ arily moving camera .
intelligent infin@@ ity : finds the colors in the picture and wi@@ ped them without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : shares the photo in rectangular cells and then creates it , rest@@ oring the col@@ t with an average number of pixel .
some effects require a long time to calculate and cause high CPU load . you can termin@@ ate this calculation at any time with the button .
the shelves are a nice little tool to make ra@@ ent@@ rop@@ es on your image . this makes it natural your pictures a wet appearance . it uses a Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ ena righ@@ tly protected algorithm .
dri@@ p size allows to change the size of the drops . since the dri@@ p size does not automatically decrease the size for small images . number and density of drops . fish stocks changes the optical effect of drops on the picture .
they can hold with &amp; digi@@ plug ; image processing a range freely from rain@@ drops . use the range of tools to keep the area , e.g. a face to stay free . if you start the filter reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ es , the area will remain free of ra@@ ent@@ rop@@ es .
this is an example of the filter fill@@ ings . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the be@@ worked picture ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photograph has the wrong floor , you can attach it through mir@@ th or turning them into the right orientation . you can find the tools in the menu transform@@ ations and transform@@ ers@@ .
photo bub@@ bles is definitely one of the most sophisticated tools developed in order to enlarge a photo with a minimum loss of image quality .
a picture to sc@@ aled down is simple . the big question is how you can see a picture ? how can you see a picture ? how can you see or guess the limits of dis@@ solution ? how can you find missing information or guess ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm which is used here is a good job . try him and you will see it yourself .
if a photo is the wrong size you can sc@@ aled it on the desired size with the tool size . select the size change in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog box is visible below .
the tool for size change uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to increase the pixel . if you want to increase a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool to blow @-@ up .
many educational programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. sp@@ ine inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge the image . &amp; digi@@ plug was used by the I@@ MA@@ GE Team of the GR@@ EC CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you need to set the tool as you want to change the size . these settings are available in the tab New size and are listed below :
the aspect ratio has retained : when this setting is activated , the aspect ratio of the original size is retained in the original size of the original size .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter concerns greater structures . the higher this value is necessary if it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Gogh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect , it must be higher than 3 .
the buttons saved as and store are used exactly . each entry for photo increase can be stored as text file and will be loaded later .
photo bub@@ bles is very fast when making it , but it can still last very long and get a high CPU load . you can termin@@ ate the calculation at any time with the button .
you can see below an example of photo bub@@ bles when a little color image was enlarged to double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 2 ) is the result of the linear standard magni@@ fication .
the cutting of a photos is not only a frequently performed surgery but also a commonly under@@ estimated tool to create a picture . just cut the picture with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and drag the rectangle , then you will see this rectangle while you move your mouse .
if you get rid of the mouse button , the area of the photos should be cut off . thereby , you can cut a good overview like your photo by cut . you can move the size of the rectangle below . a new rectangle creates a new rectangle with the left mouse button .
once you are happy with the recording , use the button The Cut@@ ting button in the tool@@ bar and the photo is cut off ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the entries file saved or file Save In the File menu to save the newly created photo .
in the screen area you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ration that you have defined in dialogue is preserved .
in the m@@ ould you can cut the orientation as high @-@ format or cross @-@ format . in high format it is always assigned to the greater value of the height and in the lateral format of the width .
the tool normally uses an aspect ratio . that means it always is equal , regardless of whether you use centimeters , In@@ ch or any other physical size . you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog there are two buttons around the selection automatically horizontal or vertically .
below in a dialogue with the Max . ratio kno@@ b to the size to the maximum possible , depending on the chosen ratio and orientation .
the tool allows to cut its settings depending on the image orientation ( Horizont@@ al or Ver@@ tical ) . if you store the cutting tool , these settings will be stored as default values in the EX@@ IF data , so that the EX@@ IF data is repeated that the EX@@ IF data is reflected and not the original image .
the settings of the compositions assistance enables to invol@@ ve help , so that you have to get your pictures better .
harmon@@ ious triangle : harmon@@ ic particles are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . as the third party , harmon@@ ic triangles is a possibility to share a rectangle in similar harmon@@ ious triangles .
Golden Center : the golden centre is a split that is based on various natural growth model , such as the spiral of a N@@ aut@@ ilus sea , or the bub@@ bles of a sun@@ flower . it dives in all possible things that we can find as beautiful .
the golden partition is the Ir@@ r@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used to design your tem@@ ples and pyr@@ am@@ ids in all times when you have your paintings , buildings and even photos to give your cre@@ ations a natural order and beauty .
the number runs from Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i Episode 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , etc . a composition that follows this rule is considered to be visu@@ ally harmon@@ ious .
the Golden Center presents liqu@@ e@@ fied relief lines if you assem@@ ble a picture . the help is drawn below :
the Golden Spir@@ ale will bring you good results to get closer to your photos . in comparison to the third party , the golden spiral gives the view of the viewer along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ ric visual river .
a further rule are the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also called golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . it should be something that the eye can be used to lead the golden spiral . it can simply be one line or different objects . this is simply because its eye can be found without the eye , it will perform its task .
the golden triangles is also led from the top @-@ discussed gold spiral . its ver@@ tex are the middle point of the sides of the golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . note that in contrast to harmon@@ ic triangles , golden triangles are no equ@@ il@@ ateral triangles . diagonal to plac@@ em@@ ing this lines can be more dynamic .
when you use golden triangles around your frame , you will create a effect of professional phot@@ ograph@@ s dynamic Sym@@ met@@ ry . try your image focus on one of the cut areas and other visual information in the triangle . the result is a very attractive composition that can &apos;t reach them differently .
the options horizont@@ ally mirror and sc@@ ep@@ tical mirror can be used to mirror the harmon@@ ic particles .
with the button color , you can set the colour of the aid lines . if you have a picture of many colors and a high contrast , the relief lines can be invisible . on this way you can custom@@ ize the color of the lines your current picture .
the Free Rotation is a tool to rotate a picture to each angle .
if you make a photo , it is easy that you are not exactly vertically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture , where the things are turned around an angle ; image processing and the tool @-@ free rotation . select the image processing and the tool @-@ free rotation . select the rotate free rotation and adjust the target angle .
turn your picture with the sli@@ der angle . the values on this sli@@ der are given back to 0 degrees . a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image are shown on the right .
to your help , the module features a horizontal and vertical line at your disposal . move the mouse button in the image preview to lock him with a pressure on the left mouse button . now just adjust the angle as described in the previous section .
after you made an image , you will find un@@ wanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . an option to repair this is the function transformation from image processing .
an elegant way to cut the image and cut the function automatic . choose one of the following options :
the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option sm@@ ooth@@ es the image a bit after turning . note the above warning .
all per@@ tin@@ ting transform@@ ations are carried out around a fixed point in the so @-@ called reference point . this point is shown in the center of the image and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective , you need to use the red squares in the corners of your image . the preview will be automatically re@@ charged . on the right side of the dialog box you will find some information which help you to change the perspective :
new width : shows the width of the new image , including the empty areas that are made in pixels .
new height : shows the height of the new image , including the empty areas that are made in pixels .
angle to the top : shows the current angle in degrees to the upper left corner of the transformed zone .
angle to the right : displays the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the transformed zone .
angle to the bottom : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed zone .
angle to the right : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed zone .
after adap@@ tion the perspective , the image will be slightly dirty . this effect is small , but two adap@@ tations produce a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you have to adjust the perspective , you get unbe@@ ar@@ ful tri@@ angular holes at the corners . an option to use it , it is the image with transform@@ ations from image processing .
the shot tool is used to post@@ p@@ one part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite . this is no rotation , the image will be distor@@ ted with other words , a rectangle is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogram .
switch your image by clicking the horizontal angle and vertical angle . if you set the angle to zero , the angle is set to zero . a preview of the effect will appear to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be shown on the right of the preview area .
to help you get a vertical and horizontal line . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the templates to adjust your picture .
after you have carried out the scheme , the image will wi@@ per a bit felt . for a single shot this effect is usually negli@@ gible , but two chim@@ neys were so much dup@@ lic@@ ate and so you should avoid this .
after the sl@@ ack@@ ing , the image has tri@@ angular holes in the corners . an option to eliminate them is the image with transform@@ ations from image editing .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; requires a number of libraries and other pack@@ ets to read and write image formats , therefore from your system and , in some cases , such as these libraries were comp@@ il@@ ated . in most distri@@ butions you can process a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ plug .
due to this dependence of other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all available file formats , but you will always find JPEG and TIFF among them .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; shows only files in formats to know . this is done using the file extension and a comparison to this with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list . you can change this list of file expanded issues ; it can be found here . in the section configuration , you will find more information .
almost all digital cameras save photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras allow you to select the format . a detailed description of this file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ al , both formats are supported .
image compression is the application of data compression technique on digital images . redund@@ ant information will be reduced to save data on a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general there is better , smooth results than JPEG during the same compression ratio . the 200@@ 0s can also be saved , if this is specified in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the raw image format , you can read more information about Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Weather and Cambridge . you can find raw format pictures in JPEG or TIFF with the raw image conversion of &amp; digi@@ plug ; in the section configuration you can find further information about the use of modules with &amp; digi@@ plug ; .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; supported the store of raw images only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is contained in &amp; digi@@ plug . all support cameras can see below the web page from Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw materials which came from &amp; digi@@ al ; supported :
many digital cameras support the recording short films . they are often stored in the AV@@ I@@ - or MPEG format . it &apos;s no film working program and has no built @-@ in possibilities to display or edit . if you click on a film file , &amp; digi@@ s ; the &amp; K@@ DE ; settings for playback of movies to launch the program for playback .

K@@ IP@@ I module comes to a range of images into a K@@ ML structure . C@@ ML files can be opened and displayed with Google Earth format .
if you look at steps 4 and 5 , what you can do well if the initial contrast was very good , then you can carry out the first four steps with the module white .
many tools that you need the image processing are in &amp; digi@@ ment ; do not include their description here .
all image processing tools such as shar@@ pen@@ ing , turn@@ signs , rough@@ ing , noise level , etc . . use a uniform dialog box shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current picture . below you can see &amp; quot ; texture .
( 1 ) : this progress bal@@ ancing shows the status of the filter to the current picture . links from him allow five buttons to change the comparison list of the monitor area . these modes are :
vertically without dup@@ lic@@ ate . the left section shows the original and the right shows the filters on the right of the selected vision .
horizont@@ ally , without dup@@ lic@@ ate . the upper section shows the original and the bottom shows the filters below the selected comple@@ xes .
vertically parts . the left section shows the original and right to effect the effect of the filter .
the upper section shows the original and lower part to the effect of the filter .
&apos;@@ mouse over &apos; style : displays the preview if the mouse is not in the preview area and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons which you can switch on to show Excel and under@@ exposure . these colours can be adapted to the general site .
( 3 ) : as part of preview the preview . you can draw this frame with the mouse within the image and see the part of the picture you want to preview . preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the left lower corner : here is a help and possibility to reset all buttons to your standard values . all settings from the last use of the module will be noted .
the properties tab displays the essential information about the selected picture and is largely declared itself . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo characteristics : shows a summary of the most important parameters on shooting the photos . these data origin@@ ates from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this rider introduces an intuitive card search tool set on the Mar@@ ble mini @-@ program . push the mouse button on or out . press C@@ tr@@ l ; lin@@ ker mouse button are filtered and displayed . all images within this coordinates will be filtered and displayed . this assumes that your pictures are G@@ eo @-@ data .
&amp; k@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; is a editor for pall@@ ets files . the application can be used to edit paint pall@@ ets and choose from colors .
the pall@@ ets files that are installed by &amp; K@@ DE ; may either apply to all system or only one user . in the latter case they are located in your personal file for &amp; K@@ DE ; settings and hot user defined colour and last used colors .
in a dialog , you can select from a list of installed pall@@ ets or browse the folder to files .
the cur@@ sor is shown in the pallet view as a line . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
it shows the colour next to the colour . the color is described under the pallet view . here also the color name can be changed .
it can also be used to select a selection , click the area next to a color to move the cur@@ sor there . afterwards , you move the mouse with the pressing left mouse button .
if the check box B@@ m cur@@ sor below the button color is inserted , the colour is inserted into the cur@@ sor in the cur@@ sor position . the colour is inserted either inserted or over@@ write the color . this mode can be adjusted by selecting the check box when you select the check box below the cur@@ sor .
a selection , which has been created as described in the last section , can be used along with the actions copying , cutting and insert .
&amp; col@@ ore@@ dit ; used the following format for data in clip@@ board : for each color three values for the propor@@ tions of red , green and blue as well as an optional color name , followed by a two numbers in the clip@@ board , these can be inserted as a colour in &amp; col@@ ore@@ dit ;
colors in the pallet and the output of the colour selection can be pulled with the mouse .
select a color anywhere on the screen and then you can find in the color scheme on the left .
&amp; graphic viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . Graph@@ ene are not used in science , particularly in computer science , especially in computer science . so far there was no modern &amp; GUI ; contains , according to the view of the program author &amp; X11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with only few functions .
the &amp; graphic viewer ; project has set itself the target to replace these programs by a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical user interface with all functions of a well @-@ integrated &amp; K@@ DE program .
&amp; graphic viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graphical and graph@@ s ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; graph@@ it ; shows graph@@ s with all the possibilities of a well @-@ integrated &amp; K@@ DE ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :

menu to open the graphite in &amp; Kate ; open the graphics in &amp; graphic viewer ; open in a &amp; Kate .
loading of large graphics ( currently there are problems from about 1000 no@@ des and a h@@ ack to present more than these no@@ des )
further necessary software : &amp; graphic viewer ; is a &amp; K@@ DE ; program , which requires the &amp; graphical ; tool &amp; dot ; for presentation of the graph@@ s . required in detail :
the main window shows the opened graphics , each in its own under@@ window . initially , if you open &amp; graphical display , the main window contains just the symbol file and open ( empty ) List . Click on the first icon to view the dialog file .
after you have selected one or more &amp; dot ; files , the main window will look like in the lower screenshot :
as you can see , an overview on the corner is displayed if the Gra@@ ph is greater than the drawing area . you can select a fixed position of this overview or select this position automatically .
use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special keys , left and right with pressing &amp; Alt ; -@@ key ) ;
the zo@@ oming is restricted in both directions by factor 10 . below , please see the maximum com@@ min@@ ution of a graph .
if the file has been changed in &amp; graph ; charged file from another program , the following window will appear :
you can choose whether the Gra@@ ph should be re@@ loaded , or if you want to ign@@ ore the change , so you may also change your decision to change later , you can use the menu item settings . set up , see also .
if you open a graph file outside of current &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; open , &amp; eg ; in your file browser or at the command line , you have the choice if you want to open a new &amp; graphic viewer ; instance , or want to be able to exhibit at the same instance at the same time .
as in the last option , you can permanently store your choice , but also change it with the configuration dialog .
during program start you can open all graph@@ s of your last session . again , you can save your choice as well as later .
you can also define how the Gra@@ ph should be divided into several sides . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely chosen .
if you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graphics that are on one side will be placed on this page . when you store the aspect ratio , the pages are not filled out of the respective parts of the graphics .
side@@ preview with one of several sites distributed without head@@ line and with another font
the page replacement shop gives the possibility to determine the behaviour that a file on the hard disk has been changed , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can define a standard behaviour ( automatically re@@ load or change the changes ) or the program each time .
the page open the option to open the behaviour of &amp; graph , if a Gra@@ ph open outside of a running session . you can open a default behavior for this case ( open in a new window or in a sub @-@ window of the current session ) or determine that every time will be asked .
the page has the ability to establish the start behavior of &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; set . you can open a standard behaviour ( the files of the last session or not ) or determine at any start after that time .
the context menu , which normally appears with a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; further possibilities will be opened :
here you can select among various &amp; graph@@ s ; -@@ Lay@@ ers algorithm . the entries as described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; are :
&amp; dot ; algorithm , the standard for directional graph@@ s . it produces hierarch@@ ical or str@@ ati@@ fied represent@@ ations of directed graph@@ s . the algorithm lay@@ eth the edges into the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and try to produce as short edges and as possible few cant@@ il@@ ies .
the &amp; ne@@ ato algorithm is the default for un@@ parall@@ eled graphics . it produces represent@@ ations in accordance with the spr@@ int @-@ spring model . thus , the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is the same as a statistical @-@ dimensional sc@@ aling process .
the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorithm created for un@@ parall@@ eled graph@@ s a spr@@ int @-@ spring layout . it uses the Fru@@ ist @-@ Rein@@ gold @-@ He@@ ur@@ istics , and includes a surplus @-@ proof for the treatment of large and clu@@ ster@@ ed graphite .
the &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm lay@@ eth the no@@ des in shape according to the description of Six und Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and Kau@@ ff@@ man and Wi@@ ese , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cycli@@ c structures .
open a dialog when you want to specify a layout command , which will then be executed by a Shell in the x@@ dot format . with such a layout command , you can give special options , or modify the graphics with a filter , before it is drawn .
determin@@ es the type of graph@@ s ( fixed or perf@@ ecting ) , and turns the standard algorithm for the respective type ( dot ; for directional , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for un@@ ite graphics ) .
this setting is activated , the overview will be displayed if this is necessary . otherwise it is not displayed and the positioning menu is in@@ active .
shows the What is the mouse button . Click on a &amp; GUI . Click the mouse to get further help to this element ( if available ) .
a list of changes is available under this address and in the file Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the base folder of the source arch@@ iv@@ s .
&amp; graphic viewer ; is a &amp; K@@ DE ; program that uses the &amp; graph ; tools for displaying . it uses the following program packages :
special setup is not necessary to use &amp; graphical viewer ; find further options in the menu settings .
the main window of the Symbol @-@ Ed@@ itors is divided into five areas : the main tool@@ bar , the vest for drawing dies , the .@@ color palette and grid screen , where you can draw the icon .
creates a new symbol . if the current file has been changed , you will be asked if you want to save the changes . thereafter , a dialogue in which you can choose whether the symbol of a template should be created , or whether you want to start again .
after the final turn , step back . if you do not have a step back@@ ward , this function is de@@ activated .
add the clip@@ board as a new picture ( if the clip@@ board contains a symbol ) .
using the current symbol in grey scales . this may generate colors , which do not match the symbol palette of &amp; K@@ DE ; match .
does not change the symbol , but sets the current color on the color of the point , click on you .
the status bar shows you the current actions . from left to right , it shows you the x@@ - and y @-@ coordinates of the current pixel surface , the size of the current character surface , the magni@@ fication factor and the current number of colours of the symbol .
add the clip@@ board as a new picture ( if the clip@@ board contains a symbol ) .
open with Settings &amp; k@@ ic@@ one@@ dit ; set up a dialog with the three pages templates for symbols , background and tool@@ bars .
with buttons , add ... , edit ... and removing the templates for standard file , source file , com@@ el@@ file &amp; etc .
select Transpar@@ ent pixels or displays set @-@ in pixels or set links : or a chess board as transparent display . you can also set the size : the car@@ os on small , medium and large as well as the color 1 : and color 2 : choose .
the K@@ IP@@ I module images are available , to read new pictures and se@@ duce these pictures .
this module can be used to read new images from external sources and can be used . currently , two sources can be used :
pictures scan : used the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner that supports the s@@ ane project or another source like video streams . so you have to have K@@ oo@@ ka and s@@ ane installed .
if you open the menu entry Pictures , a dialog that lets you choose between all available sources on your computer . choose the source from which you want to pick the image . you can also set the source of the source for the next time .
after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears to replace your image by selecting the default values of duc@@ r@@ h to select your image . the estimated file size will be displayed in the right , lower corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find more information .
check out that the window will be fully displayed , since some settings will not be displayed .
after scanning the button you have to wait until the scan is completed and the window will be able to specify the compression and type of image file . here you can select the compression and type of image file . here you can also select the folder &amp; # 160 ; you will also choose to create or create the image .
screen photos can be created after you have selected in the Import Import &gt; Screen photo ... . a window appears in which you can adjust the various screen phot@@ om@@ o@@ di :
select the complete working area to read a single window under the mouse .
if all your program windows has been selected , the call program will disappear , so you can see other screens and windows . otherwise , after a brief delay , the currently visible work@@ space will read only the window under the mouse .
the delay for how long screen photo is waiting before it starts . if you should switch to other areas of work , you should select this delay too high , in order to navigate there .
following the screenshot of the screenshot , the dialog options of the target picture is displayed on the options above .
the K@@ IP@@ I module calendar has currently no documentation . if you are interested in writing these pages , please contact the mail@@ ing@@ list of K@@ IP@@ I Teams under K@@ DE @-@ im@@ aging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. Note : the participants of this list speak English .
this module will archi@@ ved your albums on CD / DVD media with the K@@ 3@@ b burner program . you can simply select the easy @-@ to @-@ four albums . a HTML interface can be created for the comfortable navigation . also , the Auto@@ Play option is also available for Windows platforms .

the K@@ IP@@ I module for ge@@ ographic loc@@ alization allows to add GPS coordinates in the met@@ ad@@ ata of an image and edit . the ge@@ ographic data is stored in the EX@@ IF stit@@ utes of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in an external browser .
the ge@@ ographic loc@@ alization of the ge@@ ographic loc@@ alization offers tools to loc@@ alize images ge@@ ographic in the spher@@ ical coordinate system , which is used by GPS and Galileo is used to loc@@ al@@ ise height , longitudinal and lat@@ itude .
to cor@@ related your pictures with geographical data , you need a GPS channel as a XML file in the G@@ P@@ X format . g@@ pp . g@@ p@@ enk@@ abel and g@@ pp . you can download and convert your GPS device to you from your GPS device .
picture Ge@@ ograph@@ ical loc@@ alization Kor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can lead a number of selected pictures with a GPS track .
select the images that you want to cor@@ related in the main window and call the menu . in order to load a possible correlation between time and loc@@ alization , you have to load a track file with G@@ P@@ X file . this file contains the same time recorded at same places such as the images of your camera .
if the file loaded is automatic Cor@@ relation carried out the coordinates in red . GPS track data are recorded in GMT @-@ time and therefore , the camera time must be converted with GMT . this can be carried out with the time zone . Click here your camera switches .
the adjustment for the maximum time deviation is a upper deviation for the GPS time and camera @-@ time . is the deviation among them will be merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you don &apos;t have track data from a place , you can process the G@@ P@@ X file manually and add to the pictures . the time difference of 2000 seconds will be cor@@ related all pictures in this area .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ate and difference in minutes can be used if you don &apos;t have appropriate data . if you know that reality is a location in a big difference between camera and GPS , you can put this limits here and then cor@@ related the button to inter@@ pol@@ ate .
the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful if you have a set of photos on the same place . since the dialog box must use OK button to use only the button OK to set the data on the current photo .
the location can also be found with the displayed map correctly and then enlarge it . select the respective region and enlarge it again . height must always be selected manually . the card can always be selected manually . the card can be changed between card mode , satellite image and a mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module there are possibilities to hang up the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script that the ex@@ i@@ ft@@ ool is used to provide a stack of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums than HTML pages .
this module can export your albums in a picture gallery of HTML pages in form to version 4.0@@ 1 . you can select the albums out as HTML pages . the character set is encoded as UTF @-@ 8 to enable a best possible internation@@ alization .
the module has four hor@@ semen in which the settings can be adjusted . if you need to select the albums , select the albums on the right side , you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area of them the Al@@ ben@@ chmarks and the text of the HTML page will appear on the HTML page .
the rider look defines the general look and layout for each page . on each picture one page creates a page in which each image will create a page in which the image will be displayed on the picture . otherwise , the picture will be displayed directly with your standard image viewer , &amp; eg ;
the rider album defines the settings where and how the gallery can be stored together with all your corresponding pictures . choose a folder with the name K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export , which contains everything , will be created there .
if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF data will be stored in your original images as well as in new pictures .
with other color depth , you can change the default color depth , and the file size does not affect itself . all other settings are explained .
the rider &apos;s screen saver allows you to adjust some of the settings from the album tab for the pictures , that are small images that are shown in the gallery .
a progress window indicates the user as far the promotion is . press down to break the process .
if the module produces the sides , the window will not be closed automatically . you can therefore read the program messages in order to display whether error occurred during the generation . the web browser will be shown automatically at the end to view the preview of the gallery . press links to the module .
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool to view images .
in particular , the K@@ IP@@ I picture viewer allows you to view a selection of images and use them basic operations such as rot@@ ations , zo@@ oming or shift . the viewer can be used with short notice and quick access to its functions .
after the start , an image will be shown in full screen mode . this can be changed in a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG L@@ oss@@ less module is a tool to alter pictures without any quality .
this module allows you to store images within JPEG format , without saving the common losses on quality and met@@ ad@@ ata .
the consequence of loss @-@ free storage is that the file size rises , since there is no compression of the color information . this is done e.g. at P@@ NG format .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client is a tool to connect your computer with a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module has currently no documentation . if you are interested in writing these products , please contact the mail@@ ing@@ list of K@@ IP@@ I Teams under K@@ DE @-@ im@@ aging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. Note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module met@@ ad@@ ata editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact the mail@@ ing@@ list K@@ DE @-@ im@@ aging @ k@@ de.@@ org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
with the import function of met@@ ad@@ ata module , you can copy data from one image to another . select the image selection dialog with which you want to copy the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the met@@ ad@@ ata . the data will be copied after clicking on the button OK .
this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy anywhere from anywhere but not in any target format . JPEG is supported when writing . please check ex@@ iv@@ 2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of a di@@ ash@@ tray .
the MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module can be used to convert selected pictures in a MPEG video , with a defined length , to convert the packages M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick . between the individual images , you can also add a basic image file in the MP2 or WAV of the di@@ ash@@ au .
all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the selected video format . in addition , you can create a background color for the di@@ ash@@ au . with this module , it is possible to create DVD / X@@ VCD / SV@@ CD / VCD for your DVD player . finally , you can eventually use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
you must first packed the images that should be packed into the MPEG Di@@ ash@@ au . thereafter , you can start using ex@@ tras MPEG Di@@ ash@@ au .
the images selected by you are listed below image files in the portfolio . there you can also change the photos or content of the list .
after you are satisfied with your list , you should custom@@ ize the other settings . if you &apos;re looking for the video format , DVD , X@@ VCD , SV@@ CD and VCD . in case you are planning the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pre@@ set and most probably the right choice for Europe .
the next step , you should specify a picture in seconds . the speed of the image process is set down below . a lower value produces very sudden , high @-@ quality images .
the background color can be set as next . in doubt you should set it black . the name and the path of the generated file can be set within the name of the MPEG @-@ output file . keep it as possible .
if you want to specify a audio file under the name of the audio source file , you can easily drink the generation of the movie . depending on the speed of your computer you can now drink a coffee or drink the di@@ ash@@ au if you return back .
if a hint appears that Ko@@ di@@ ers or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick pack@@ ets to the right below .
the printer driver allows you to print multiple images on a sheet paper together in standard phot@@ oc@@ ities . the combined images can also automatically be opened automatically with the image processing Gim@@ p . this is useful to enhance or print using the Gim@@ p module for direct expression .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import your images stored in one of three formats JPEG , TIFF or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command line d@@ cra@@ w from Dave Coff@@ in . an original condition of Him is not expecting you get from d@@ cra@@ w , such as the software produced by your camera vend@@ or . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w better results ! .
first choose the RA@@ W file to be converted , and launch the module . the Ra@@ w @-@ Converter window appears then in mode for a single image . with the button preview , you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture .
you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option decides , whether the camera settings can be adjusted for the white balance . if the result is not optimal , you can process the image later .
a four @-@ color R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected to use the contra@@ sting information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ GB@@ G switches has no effect .
once you are happy with preview , you can choose one of the three output formats . the fil@@ en@@ ame is equal , and only the extension will be adapted accordingly . JPEG uses a loss@@ less algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes .
tagged Image Format , TIFF , ret@@ ains all the information of your image and uses the loss@@ less L@@ Z@@ W compression .
in case you have to process your pictures often or later , you should not use the JPEG format , as there is only a limited number of operations permitted before joining the image quality . TIFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you are able to choose JPEG as an memory file , the met@@ ad@@ ata is stored in the RA@@ W file , in the JPEG file , in the EX@@ IF data .
if you are adapted to your settings , you can start converting the conversion button . if you want to re@@ stop this process , you can ab@@ stain from this process .
the stack@@ ing processing mode allows you to convert various images to once . use this mode if you are sure , for testing at a single image , which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to the version for individual images . however , this is helpful to over@@ write it . however , this is helpful to do this in an earlier attempt . a preview is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion is advanced .
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the program convert from Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of a album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the starting number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album .
this module can be used to change the size of several pictures of a image collection . it uses the transfer program from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can sc@@ aled the image smaller or enlarge it four types of image change :
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in dimension . width or height of the image will be automatically selected , depending on the picture orientation , the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . here , the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to fit your image format .
not propor@@ tionally : not propor@@ tions of change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed at this option .
printing process : preparing the image for the photo pressure . the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the photo paper . the target picture , including background size , mar@@ g@@ inal size and background color is adjusted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected pictures with your favorite E @-@ mail program . there is also possible to leave the size of sending images in advance . other pictures can go to the list of sending images and drop there .
after you start the module , the pictures window with the chosen images are displayed . you can add more pictures using a file selection dialog . for the last attached image will be displayed a preview of the right hand side .
you can also draw images on the picture @-@ list and add the images to the list of sending images .
using the button pictures the selected pictures from the list of sending images are removed .
after you have selected all pictures , you can open the New Message -@@ window of your e @-@ mail clients . you need to add here the addresses and the bedding . the selected pictures are already attached as app@@ endix .
don &apos;t pay attention to many pictures at once . most e @-@ mail accounts are restrictions for the size of sending e @-@ mails . it is possibly a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send many images .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending images . your configuration is stored and stored each time until you change it .
select your e @-@ mail clients from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you have to specify the right path for your installation .
in case you use the Google Mail Service , you must install the GM@@ ail@@ agent on your computer . you can download this here .
after the application of comments in an attached file , the comments are added to the images in a text file and is added to the email .
the P@@ NG format under the menu Images File format is not very suitable to use the size of photo files , but it is best adapted among the loss@@ less formats such as TIFF . if you have a fast internet connection , and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise , we recommend the JPEG format .
if you want to select JPEG format , select the original files in JPEG format , then you will add the original copy data to send pictures .
when the process is finished , the window will not be closed automatically , so that you can view the status messages , in search of errors , you can automatically turn off at the end . with the kno@@ b you can lock this window wi@@ lie ? EN .
after starting the module advanced Di@@ asch@@ au appears to have a window with questions like you want to have your Di@@ ash@@ au . you can choose between the selected and all the images of the album .
the Open@@ GL option in the presentation uses very elegant images using Open@@ GL . however , you need to have an appropriate graph card , because otherwise the Di@@ ash@@ au must be very slow .
the fil@@ en@@ ame option ensures that the fil@@ en@@ ame of images in the left corner is displayed on the lower left corner .
the loop loop ensures that the presentation will be displayed in an endless loop . you can then break out manually with Es@@ c .
the option photos random@@ ly select that the images are shown in a random sequence . so it is not used the order of images in the album .
below the delay between the images can be set between the individual images . 1500 millisecon@@ ds match 1,5 seconds and are a good standard . the best distance depends on your computer and the selected transition effect . you should be able to test this before you show your friends !
there are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can choose . random@@ ly select a different effect at each transition between the pictures .
during the Di@@ ash@@ au you can connect to a tool@@ bar at the upper left screen of the screen . move the mouse into this corner for you .
with this tool bar , you can hold the presentation and start again , start the previous and next picture and stop the di@@ ash@@ au .
at the lower bottom of the screen you can see the current fil@@ en@@ ame , the position of the current picture and the total number of images in your presentation .
currently , the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date only has no documentation . if you are interested , please contact the mail@@ ing@@ list of the K@@ IP@@ I Teams under K@@ DE @-@ im@@ aging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. Note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module background is a tool for setting a picture as background image for the work surface .
this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of shopping , as a background for your K@@ DE work surface .
once you have provided your images and videos with comments , you can see &amp; photo album ; through this Brow@@ se , see picture . as you can see by a comparison with the image , so in people , places and in the group pass@@ words present .
in the browser window , you can see the categories where you have entered any information as you have entered your images and videos with comments , which look at your hard drive and view the actual screen@@ shots . in the following is described for itself .
if you register with the mouse on the entry , change the view of the browser . see picture .
if you select a further person only the pictures are displayed , on which both people are visible . through this selection method , you can limit the number of images shown by a few thousand pictures on a few individual images .
if you have selected all people , locations and other settings , you can view the pictures you need to view the pictures of your action area .
in the picture , each person has the same symbol before its name . you can store &amp; photo album ; however , for each person your own preview , this is true of course also for locations , keywords , and other categories which you have defined . see the image .
to view images in addition to the name , select the button , which you want to set right outside on the tool@@ bar . here , you can select the view that you can view symbols with pictures of persons and simultaneously a list of keywords ( if you have no suitable images for your search words ) .
however , you need to define which image will be shown for each individual person . in order to view this , you need to adjust the image reference value according to your requirements . in the window , you can adjust the magni@@ fying factor according to your wishes and to be truncated if part of the image is displayed or cut off .
if you are looking for searching in the main window , a dialog will display you a dialog , showing the dialog for fix@@ ture of Image Properties . this dialog can view it even at the picture once again .
if you want to enter a character sequence into the field of let@@ tering or descriptions of the images according to this text . if you wish , you can also use one part of the entire data , thus e.g. 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two dates such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
using the options in the lower part of the window , you can browse all pictures after certain names , as you can see in the picture . here , on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene are m@@ apped .
this is the user manual for &amp; photo album ; if you would not like to read manuals , but rather to try out functions , have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo album ; and check out the quick release , the screen photos and the introductory videos .
launch &amp; Win@@ photo album ; and select the photo album , if you start &amp; photo album ; for the first time , or select the menu entry for the first time ; you can then start some sample pictures and you can try the functions of &amp; photo album ; try out .
if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo album ; as a related HTML document to download .
at the bottom edge of the master window of &amp; k@@ photo album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this strip you see here : . as the name suggests , this bar shows you data statistics about the images in your database .
the tim@@ eline can display several different time units . each strip shows then another unit . you can change between the units , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by taking the strip only 10 minutes sections .
the tim@@ eline can be found on the following ways : you can select the displayed preview view from the database ( if you select a date , you will always show the current date of the currently displayed images , if you navigate in preview @-@ Preview ) .
you can also select a range of tim@@ eline by pressing the mouse button and press the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , so the time values . if you can choose a area , you &apos;ll pull you in preview of this period . you can pick the selection by clicking on a bar in the tim@@ eline .
&amp; photo album ; gives you two ways to create HTML pages with your images . the one is in &amp; photo album ; integrated and the other as module available ( see ) . in the following part of the user manual , it is described in &amp; photo album ; built @-@ in version you can create and retri@@ eve the HTML menu .
before HTML pages are created you need to set some settings . these are split into the three areas of content , layout and finish . in the following information , each area will be more precise .
first enter the title of the file and a description that should contain the HTML file later . on photo album ; HTML example pages do you see an example of these settings .
next you choose whether a &amp; photo album ; export file is to be created on the heading page . you will find further information about export files you will find in .
last@@ ly , you can select which information on the HTML pages can be displayed , which can be displayed clearly without a description . for example , that all pictures of a party are shown . you can not use all pictures . you can &apos;t use this setting to hide certain images prior to certain template .
in this section you can define how the HTML pages should look like . most setting options are unique , which is why not specifically received in this section .
below on the page you can set different resolutions for the images . thereby , those need to view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution of 800x600 , no pictures anymore , for example , a resolution of 1600@@ x@@ 1200 .
you can change the resolution at any time you can change the resolution at any time . it &apos;s possible to browse your images with low resolution , indicating to a lower transmission time , and , if he wants to get a larger image , he changes to higher resolution .
in this setting range you place the different folders and the URL where your website is stored .
most of your HTML files , choose a basic folder for all your HTML files and a new sub@@ folder .
first , you have to select the main folder where all your images are stored . this folder will be stored and set automatically during the next time . this folder can select either a folder or from K@@ DE supported protocol , for example :
after you have created your images , you can check if this really are all for viewer . if you are created for the basis folder a URL , after the pages are created , the URL you should be installed here . otherwise , the web browser should start in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files created by you are not yet in final target folder you need to copy it manually . so , the import function will need to specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folders in which all sub @-@ folders will be displayed .
the just described options described above all three are related to bas@@ eline or UR@@ Ls . in these , a sub@@ folder will create , whose name you can define in the folder folder .
if you &apos;re looking forward to a family party , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; photo album , you may need to view a HTML page to view the images . if you &apos;re using a HTML page to view the images , recording , etc . , you have to do with &amp; photo album ; this work must not even make .
with &amp; photo album ; you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ im file . you can import other data into your database . they are imported with excep@@ tions and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im -@@ files , internal and external . they differ as if the images itself is saved in the file , that you can have all pictures together , and this file can be saved as independent . the obvious dis@@ advantage is however the file size .
you can create a .@@ k@@ im file directly from the menu file export ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file along with a HTML file , this is an external .@@ k@@ im file .
one external .@@ k@@ im file sear@@ ches the pictures on two times . first , the images that are given in the file of .@@ k@@ im -@@ file are searched , so the images of the URL you can search for creating the html @-@ files . this is only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using HTML import .
in the following dialog for exp@@ orting images , you can download from the menu file export ...
the most important option of this dialog box is to act in order to act internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . it offers you the following three selection options :
when you manually copy the images to the .@@ k@@ im @-@ file , you need to copy the images in the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im @-@ file .
with the option Autom@@ atically copied and copied to the .@@ k@@ im @-@ file format ; the pictures automatically be used for you .
.@@ k@@ im -@@ files are normal Zip files . as most of the images are already compressed using JPEG and the XML file itself is quite small it is not worth to comp@@ ress the files . if you want to comp@@ ress this , just select the export file to comp@@ ress it .
the last option of this page is maximum image size limit . if you would like to send your friends images , because the .@@ k@@ im file would be very big enough . here , you can limit the size , by example , that each image will be maximum 800 pixels high and width .
if you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu file Import , will be &amp; k@@ photoelectric Album ; the exported database as described in detail .
the assistant to import@@ ing consists of four steps . first , you need to select which pictures you want to import , afterwards , in which folders should be copied to import pictures .
it may be that you should person@@ al@@ ise the category of people to the imported file ( if you are a Dan@@ e ) , while this category is asked for your database . this is why you should be imported in the third dialog box , which are to be imported into your database and correspond to which categories are in your database .
in the fourth step , you can finish the categories of the imported file with the categories of your current database . an example will see you on the picture .
it must be simple to view images and watch : when you see images , you would like to view images of your Italy &apos;s vacation and see a picture of your friend you wish to see images on which this friend is depicted , see images .
in this hand@@ book , you will find the various steps of ( 1 ) adding the information about your pictures , through ( 2 ) the sear@@ ches and look at up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and adap@@ tations .
K@@ Photo@@ album was started as a program to manage your pictures . but it has been extended and today also car@@ es your videos . at many places in this manual will have been talking about images , but frequently , this also closes videos with one .
&amp; photo album ; stores all its information in the d@@ x@@ .x@@ ml file in the top folder of their images . this is a simple XML file , which allows you to backup to a program or re@@ visions in CV@@ S , where you want .
&amp; photo album ; please note the folder where your images are saved and uses this in future Star@@ ts automatically . if you want to start a different file tree with pictures , you can start &amp; photo album ; with the option -@@ c . as an example : k@@ photo album -@@ c ~ / company / Photos / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
via the menu entry settings ; set up to a window , where you can change the settings of &amp; photo album ; you can change the settings of the user manual in the following section of the user manual .
on the left you can see six different symbols with which you can preview the settings of Preview and the options for viewing , you can call an exhau@@ st@@ ive help to call the F1 key and a click on the desired option .
it was described to you as you can set different qualities for each picture , e.g. persons , locations and keywords . you can also create your own groups such as items , animals or albums .
in order to see the dialog , which is used to process existing groups . for any existing group you can select a label and a symbol .
under sub@@ categories , sub@@ categories were already mentioned . in the dialogue options , you can set up complete member groups , i.e. , all members of a group set up once in a group instead of all groups of a central gli@@ des as stated in .
in case you can see the setting options you can choose to set up the member groups . with the above selection list , you can configure the category . in the left window boxes , you can select a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories .
&amp; photo album ; shares his modular system with other graphics applications , such as digi@@ k@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this modular system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; K@@ DE ; image plug@@ in interface . read more on the homepage of K@@ ip@@ i .
the modules can be called upon the menu modules . the modules can not be described , because they are not part of &amp; photo album , but are separately distributed . most modules have a help page that you can call on the modules itself .
as the modules of multiple applications can be used together , it can be used to test the modules with &amp; low photo album ; you should first use the demo database with the command &gt; k@@ photo album -@@ demo &lt; user@@ name \ &gt; or via the help menu . don &apos;t say , I would not have warned .
the applications that use modules over K@@ IP@@ I , are very different , making it possible that some modules with &amp; photo album is not functioning . this is the dis@@ advantage , if you divide functions with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; photo album ; and other applications that can use C@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications can be found in albums ; even though &amp; photo album ; this kind of order does not support the order to albums , so you can use the functions with &amp; photo album .
sim@@ ulates &amp; photo album ; the current album , which corresponds to the current view , so all images that shows the picture preview at the moment .
besides the current album you have to have a photo album ; the modules also has a list of albums . here goes &amp; photo album ; as follows :
if &amp; photo album ; s browser shows the contents of a category , e.g. all persons , then each entry of this category is an album for the module .
or the category , which you have set in the Settings dialog as a category for virtual albums , used . if you are using for example the category persons , is used &amp; photo album ; so you would like to have persons selected to view and to share this module .
since some modules with &amp; photo album ; you can not remove this from the list of modules . launch the settings dialog and select the modules installed in the modules installed .
on the picture you can see an example of a starting screen as soon as you &amp; photo album ; with your own pictures .
as you can see it from any other K@@ DE application , you can see as a menu and tool@@ bar . under the tool@@ bar , you can view the window , as you can &apos;t see any information about your pictures . in the section we will show you all the images that shows you an overview with all existing pictures .
one of the main features of &amp; photo album ; is the possibility to view any image with comments , where the image has been recorded separately or for a larger number of images certain comments are shown . if for example , on all images Jes@@ per pictures and all pictures in Copenhagen have been recorded .
all of these notes may be used for searching and Brow@@ se , as you can read in the section . if you like to check this comment when you use the built @-@ in viewer .
in view three lists with a text field by using persons , locations and pass@@ words . these are a very important part of &amp; photo album , since you will always use it again if you need information about your pictures .
the following idea is based on the picture within the list : if you have a family business , and on all 50 images , the same 5 @-@ 10 persons can be m@@ apped , you can find that the used names are shifted upward , which can be found faster and allocated .
in case you prefer to receive a alphabet@@ ically sorted list , click on the symbol for sorting to date under the list .
if you have selected notes for each image , you may have to edit any selected pictures and write these pictures with comments . Click on the right and back buttons that are located under the preview of the picture on the top .
if you have several pictures , e.g. with the same person , then it can mark more convenient to mark all these pictures and add the menu item multiple entries to a note with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all around the USA . there are also San Francisco and Los Angeles in California .
on the picture you can see a browser window of the USA . in order to show you that it is a over@@ lap , a special symbol will be displayed .
in the context menu of the mark@@ er dial@@ ogs it is possible to add an entry into a pre @-@ existing or sub@@ category . in addition , you can also create an entry into a category . attention , this assumes that you just sort your categories in alphabetical order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move the individual elements of the memory dial@@ ogs by clicking the cor@@ di@@ ct of the frame , click and move them . you can also make your own window by using a window by moving out outside the window range . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have adapted the look of the window that your needs are adapted to your needs , click on the button options ... , which offers you the option to store the current construction and the appearance of the window .
you can also leave a frame in the frame . if you want to display this window later , use the button options ... and then you &apos;ll find a / out window . this process can be seen in the picture .
if you select the entry images in browser , you get an overview with imag@@ ery images of the currently selected pictures , or all images in case you have no filter . you can configure the size of the mouse , through simple after pulling the mouse with the middle mouse button . try it just once .
when you aband@@ on a picture in the background of your desktop , this picture is set up as background image for your desktop .
once you click on a picture , this image will be shown in the picture viewer . if you have no windows open with a picture viewer , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete pictures in the picture preview . simply select the corresponding pictures from which you want to delete or choose the menu button or select the Edit menu . now you will see the window that you can see in the picture .
&amp; photo album ; provides you a solution for this problem . you can also use &amp; photo album ; namely , you can also use the pictures somewhere , so &amp; photo album ; you can see image from &amp; photo album ; if not all the necessary images can be loaded from the hard disk .
images , where the right upper corner is truncated , are not saved on the hard disk . this is , e.g. with pictures 1 @-@ 9 , however , the preview photos can be shown , such as &amp; photo album ; you can also see this pictures with the picture viewer .
as you see this feature , you will need to copy files from folders and restore them again . if you want to avoid trouble how to avoid any length of your images , please purchase a larger hard drive to save all pictures .
in the menu images , you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want a little more privacy , filter the images so that you can see for other un@@ accessible in the menu . alternatively , you can also see all pictures that can view your little sister , and choose the menu entry Any@@ thing out of current view .
in this case , you have set what images in case of the case be hidden . if you want the laptop now your little sister , just select the menu entry pics , which you can be blo@@ cked , when you want to display the pictures , click on locks .
it is also possible to set a password to un@@ lock the images to un@@ lock the images . to set up this password , select a password change in the menu privacy .
please consider that this picture protection is not sure . for one of you can read or delete all pictures on the hard disk and the other , you can read the password as un@@ lock text , but those who are familiar with &amp; photo album ; not very familiar to hide the look at private images .
why you manage all your pictures with &amp; photo album ; managing and hours over hours you would like to describe them . from this reason , you &apos;re looking at some point . from this reason , you can preview it . from preview , as described in described .
the viewer can see you in view . of course , it shows the picture , but additional all the information you have about the image , such as who is done on the picture , when and where was it done , etc .
if the Info@@ box on the upper part of the picture you want to see , so you can easily remove what information is displayed and if any information can be displayed . all these options are available after a right click on the viewer , and then you can see the context menu .
some words in the Info@@ box are under@@ lined . if you click here , the browser , see , matching entries to this . if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , shows you all pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . if you selected persons from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene selected .
in case you have several pictures in the viewer , you can change between them and return , by using the keys image high and picture . you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and end . these functions are also available from the context menu .
if several pictures are loaded in the viewer , you can run this as a di@@ ash@@ au . then you can download it as a new image after a few seconds . how often you can control a new image by clicking the C@@ tr@@ l key and plus or minus . when you stopped and stopped the di@@ ash@@ au through the keys C@@ tr@@ l ; S .
a very useful ability to switch &amp; photo album , to switch to full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the complete place on the screen . simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back .
if you are using the viewer you can fall in the picture you can simply catch a rectangle with the mouse button . with the Min@@ us button , you can return r@@ aus@@ zo@@ oming The Plus key in the center of the image . shows how a zoom rectangle is marked and displays the result of Z@@ OO@@ MS .
with the point @-@ key , you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not drawn up . with the equ@@ ator button , the Z@@ OO@@ MS , so that each pixel corresponds to a pixel image of the image .
note that the single zoom operations begin to work in videos that are p@@ itted and zo@@ oming with the Plus@@ - and Min@@ us aste .
using the context menu from the context menu , you can rotate the image . this does not work with videos . you can do notes on the actual picture with the menu item notes from the context menu .
when you can see images , you can find a picture of a person whose name you forgot to put on the picture . at the moment you can open the image and configuration dialog for the image . but you &apos;ll be able to highlight the image and see further pictures .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures on paper . in order to see what photos you can start with the pictures and install it as well or bad , while you can watch one after another .
for the two examples above gives you the possibility to view images with features , while you can view them . features are the letters A to Z and you can express a feature that you are set up the corresponding letters . in view the features A , B and C are set .
as soon as you have set features on your images , you will be able to print , print or whatever you have selected , so you can simply use all the images to copy the selected pictures to a CD or whatever you want .
categories and especially characteristics can be displayed in the preview view . if you want to view the categories in DR@@ E , then you can press features to the images by pressing the letters for the feature after the image was selected . this can be seen here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case , you will allow you to paint your photo album on the picture .
the painted screen will not be saved with the image , but in the database . on the way you can re@@ vo@@ ke your mixture later .
in an image you can see on the painted picture . in order to switch the painting by &amp; k@@ photo album ; click on the picture emerg@@ es from the context menu . in order to finish the mouse in the tool@@ bar top at the window .
to work with &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; you need to work the application of the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; do not fully prevail , but the documentation zu &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; should you be read and understood .
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object characteristics and shown the object in the wire @-@ view views yellow .
you can also select several objects at the same time . but not the object of an already selected object , since all objects are already selected with the object .
to insert a new object in object tree , select the position you want to insert and click on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu entry in the menu .
there are more possible positions , which ends the following command menu , so that you can choose the right position :
remove from the menu bar either from the menu bar under Edit or from the context menu of the right mouse button , you can remove any selected objects from the scene .
if you have changed characteristics , click on User to take these changes . if you have entered inv@@ alid values , a message with a bug description will be displayed , then you can immediately click the input errors or re@@ ject the changes .
when you enter the path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; enter your user documentation in the dialog box , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with assistance .
you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL user documentation to use this property . if this documentation is not included in your distribution you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 also contains the user documentation .
for a texture or a part of a texture , you can view a preview of your own image view .
press preview in your own image view and a small example of the scene is rendered with the chosen texture . if you only want a piece of texture , even if you only want a piece of texture ( for example a texture in a texture Map and not the whole texture Map ) , cross the local texture .
the screenshot shows the control points of the camera . you can draw this control points with the mouse and change the position and direction of the camera .
if a transformation is chosen , the control points and there will be a small cross shown in the wire @-@ line view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotating . you can change the shift by pulling in the mouse within the entire window .
each object has a wire line as a wire level . you can specify this value relative to the visibility level or an absolute value . objects are displayed only if they are selected or equal to the visibility of sight or equal to the scene of the scene .
&amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; has a window order as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
if you don &apos;t need the default window order , or if you need another arrangement , you can easily adjust them . you can also store multiple window orders and easily switch between different regulations .
to an@@ ew a window over or under a present view , please draw the line to the top or bottom edge of a view . a rectangle shows the new position .
to create a new column , drag the line to the right or left side of a view . the new view is an@@ cho@@ red on the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height .
if you would like to arrange multiple views on each other , enter the Anf@@ am in the middle of a different view . you can then change among the views by clicking on the map cards top in the views .
the last possible window order are pending views : views , which are not an@@ cho@@ red in the main window . to fix a view from the sl@@ ack@@ et , take the initial arrow onto the working surface or click the little arrow pointing at the temp@@ est bar .
to complete a view , click on the small cross in the Anf@@ al bar . to prevent the shut@@ down , click on the little square between arrow and cross .
you can insert additional views in the main window . in the menu View , you will find entries for any type of views . new views are floating , you can an@@ cho@@ red them in any favourite spot .
the current window view allows you to save window . it will save a dialogue in which you can store the window order under a existing or new name .
if you have a scene , you can ren@@ ders them . &amp; p@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g to ren@@ ders , this program needs to be installed properly . as this manual has been written and P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 is currently not supported . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; version 1.0 does not support .
to ren@@ ver the current scene , click Ren@@ dering The symbol ren@@ ders in the tool@@ bar or select the menu entry view .
a R@@ ender mode con@@ forms to entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determin@@ es the image size and quality of the ren@@ ders . if you insert a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can add many R@@ ender modes , from a fast preview to full images in highest quality .
if you click on the symbol The R@@ ender settings in the tool@@ bar or in the menu View R@@ ender modes ... choose the following dialog :
every R@@ ender mode has a name . you can choose any name , but it &apos;s a name that can recognize the characteristics of the mode .
in the map size you can enter the width and height of the last picture . if you want only a small area of the image , select the check box and enter the image section to ren@@ ders in the input fields .
in combination with quality , you can select the properties tab . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user Refle@@ ction lighting . a detailed description of the R@@ ender properties can be found in the user manual &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; .
if a picture is rendered with only a beam each , there can be different mist@@ akes . these pictures often have a mo@@ ir@@ è samples or stud effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed if they are displayed smaller than a pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; used a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing in order to decrease the influence of this error . generally images with this feature is better .
if you switch anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and connects &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than a beam per pixel . this technique is called super @-@ sampling .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of the super @-@ sampling . as standard is an adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive because each pixel is still divided and adjusted again because each pixel is split again and adap@@ tive because of the calculated color values .
if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray pursu@@ es a beam to the ad@@ diction of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you need to adjust the value of an additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling , a grid of 4x4 will be calculated additionally , at a depth of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixels , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue in the second pixel . the difference is then :
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 beams per pixel . if the difference between the colours is shared , the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixel , which can be used individually and checked for a further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of records can be set to the depth of depth .
another possibility to reduce ali@@ asing effect is the generation of noise for the beam process , called J@@ itter@@ ing . if you switch j@@ itter@@ ing , changes &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the beams around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the last setting for the quality of the Ren@@ der@@ ns is diffuse reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the diffuse reflection spec@@ xion is calculated . it takes a very long to calculate a scene with this feature .
on this map ticket you can adjust whether the alpha channels are calculated using POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent if the corresponding beams have no object .
open a new window for displaying the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ exp@@ ec@@ tedly , you can find the reason for this .
to import an &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; select the menu entry into Import ... and select a file in the dialog window .
currently supports &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; not even the complete command of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; . when import@@ ing error messages or war@@ nings , a dialog window indicates a list of messages .
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; write these spring text between the two special comments / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ end .
you can extract objects from object tree into the editor to export the source text file in the Editor . to import objects into the scene file , select the source code in Editor and draw him into the object tree .
with copying and paste in &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; and in your editor , you can also include source for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also included .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called if &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; a scene usually is p@@ ov@@ ray or x @-@ p@@ ov@@ ray .
if you click on help in your own image view , opens &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation to the displayed object . put the path to your document and the version . versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; search for external files ( for example , al@@ ti@@ dd@@ ging ) in the path to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; libraries . if you refer to files that are not in the folder of the scene , you must also enter the path into different path of the library , the first found file is used .
the color for wire @-@ models . the second color is used to display the selected objects .
the color for control points . the second color is used for displaying the selected control points .
the colour of the rectangle for the visual field in the camera view and in the window Type logo .
you can set the object of points on the pitch in the context menu of the wire @-@ pin Vie@@ ws . you can set the grid separately for p@@ ush@@ es , sc@@ aling and scripts .
greater values make an accurate wire model and thus a better nails for the shown objects , but require more time to ren@@ ders . for some objects such as the sphere you can adjust the detailed level for two directions .
if you cross the highly detailed projec@@ tions for extended projec@@ tions , all wire model controls are further divided , if the camera is extended to extended projec@@ tions , with excep@@ tions from perspective and per@@ tin@@ ent projec@@ tions . this feature gives a better approach to projec@@ tions , but requires more time to ren@@ ders .
when you cross wall display a wall behind the objects , the wall is depicted in a chess break samples from two adjustable colours .
when you cross the floor , a soil is framed below the objects . the floor is shown in a chess break samples from two adjustable colours .
if you cross edge working , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method for the rendering of scenes is used . the values for depth and sw@@ elling values can be adjusted . more information on the parameters you can find in section R@@ ender modes .
on this page you can create existing window orders or create new window orders . in the window s@@ akes section , you can create and store window orders .
the combination field standard window order : displays all existing window s@@ akes . &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; used the selected window order in the start of the program .
the list of t@@ apped windows orders displays all existing shut@@ dow@@ els . a new arrangement allows you to create and delete a selected arrangement with the button .
every window order is identified by the name . the name must be clear@@ ely and may not be empty .
the list below shows all views of the chosen win@@ dow@@ code . new views can be created with the button and remove selected Vie@@ ws with the button Remove .
the position of the new window . with new column you create a new column on the right side of the available window , with card card , you can view a map postcard , together with the previous view and floating , the view does not contain in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you have just &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; installed and now you want to start without more accurate knowledge of both programs . if you &apos;re able to create all steps in this guide , you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene : a ball on one level .
but you should carefully consider the following war@@ nings , before you make sure that you use as a result of a black screen . if you use a 3D program for the first time you should consider this important rules :
if you do not adjust the camera , no rules for the rendering will be applied , as a result , you will get a black image .
if you insert any light sources , your whole scene is in the dark , and you will only receive a black image .
if you have all installed in@@ correctly , you see at the first start of &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; the following default window order :
take a little time to know the menus and the existing symbols of the tool@@ bar . read the documentation , so you can get a reasonable presentation , what you can expect from this program .
you will need to use these menus and symbols , so you should remember the menus and symbols , and also their applications .
&amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; starts with a simple scene . to remove this guide , you must first remove all objects from the object tree . mark the scene and then select the menu entry to edit . so you have a scene without objects .
the wire @-@ model view shows how the camera shows the whole scene that you generate . in particular , the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this shows you the outcome of the scene of the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , see the contents of the view object properties which can find the different parameters of the camera . in the user documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; you will find further details .
change nothing to the basic settings of the camera , that &apos;s later instructions reserved , but please note that camera &apos;s camera in view control points , with which you can change the target point of the camera . just click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired place .
if you press the button or the entran@@ ces , change the wire @-@ size Vie@@ ws and the object tree immediately accordingly to these settings . as a result , they see here the scene from the view@@ point of camera .
there are many ways to create the bottom for the scene . for example , you could add a Qu@@ ot@@ ony ( inser@@ ting end@@ ony body Qu@@ ader ) and the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but that is an comprehen@@ sible approach to solution of this task .
&amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; offers really a simpler way . you can use an infinite level as the ground :
a good advice : select the level in object tree , change the name and press the button User or the entran@@ ces . in the object tree , the new name will be displayed immediately .
the wire @-@ window view is also showing the level , although at the moment only a limited level . when you ren@@ ders the scene , the level extends the level to the horiz@@ on .
if you can view the object tree , you will find that you can find the entry for any new object . in this case you can see the options for each new object : angel@@ ing , rotation and shift . choose one of these options , change the possible settings in the view of the object properties .
in this scene you should shift the soil for exercise a unit under the horizontal line , so you can learn some of these parameters . choose the shift and set the values as follows :
select the ground only to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but select a little bit multiple .
in both cases a dialog when you can choose to select how the object should be inserted . the pigment is then changed in the object tree ( name = bottom pigment ) , with one click on the button . see how the pigment is now looks .
of course , the preview of pigments only shows a matt black material because you can check the look of materials at any time with a click on preview . if you are able to preview the appearance of materials at any time . now there are many possibilities , but you now take the eas@@ iest way .
if you do not see any color on qu@@ ader and ball , click on the user button and then call the preview .
the material for the floor is right now . if you can now run your picture with a click on the symbol , you should get the following result :
of course , this does not have the colour that you are expected . here you need to set two new attributes . in addition , select this entry twice ( you can do this also more frequently , but the ch@@ board color list can be used only with two colors ) :
in the object tree , select one time and change the colours in the object of object characteristics :
this step , you should be simply run , as you might understand the basic working methods of &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; the ball is just as easy as the ground :
in the view of the object properties you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : 1 ( do not forget the input button or the button ) , so the sphere would be flo@@ at over the floor , because you would have shifted the ground to a unit down@@ wards .
of course , the Ren@@ dering results now a rare result : as already before , the ball surface appears like a matt black material . put on the following step a suitable material .
if you select the ball , you can now add a material now . as in the ground , give the ball a pigment as color :
choose First sub@@ object and change the name for example in sphere pigment . Click the sc@@ oop of pigments , then choose entry and set the values as follows :
but you can achieve even more interesting effects , if you take time to set some finish properties :
then change the values like in the following screen photos and click on Users or press the entran@@ ces .
the shine effect and reflection are already able to result in some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chrome surfaces , even if metal is not selected :
you should now have a good impression that provides you &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; provides hop@@ efully you have learned so much , that you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ gen is a R@@ ender method to produce a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or one model .
when you encounter a scene ra@@ y@@ trac@@ er , the ren@@ ders hypo@@ thet@@ ical beams from the view of the viewer , which is reflected and broke out , the scene of light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects of the light sources can be eff@@ ected , such as fog , the scene pixels for pixels being processed .
as you can imagine , you will see without a camera , the camera is your eye , with which you see the scene . without a light source , you can see any scene . obviously , any scene need to be rendered , some light sources and at least one camera .
the usual file dialog box can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
open a file . in the default file dialog you can select a file which you have previously using &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ;
whenever you open a new model or create , the file is inserted into this sub@@ menu and replace the oldest entry in the list .
if you have already saved the model , it is stored under the same name . if it &apos;s a new file , you have to enter a name and storage space .
represents the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last store are rejected .
this menu entry can only be selected if you have not saved any saved changes in the scene .
repeat the latest re@@ plac@@ ements . this menu entry can only be selected if you use the Edit menu .
saves the current window order and opens a dialog in which you can enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ write an existing configuration .
in this menu , you will find options for setting &amp; p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; here you can change the look , the short@@ cut and the default behavior .
opens a dialog for changing the keyboard @-@ shorter . you can change commands to change or add new commands to this option .
open a dialog for Setup of the tool bar . you can add and remove the tool symbols for &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; add commands and remove .
a B@@ ump @-@ Map is a possibility to wrap rough surfaces without any b@@ ump on the surface and change without any geomet@@ rical form of the object .
it is common to use the same file for a B@@ ump @-@ Map as well as for a texture Map .
basic body are simple geomet@@ rical forms which you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these plots . these models are then processed further to give them a more realistic appearance .
a texture Map is a possibility to give the surface of an object color to pixels , through application of image file as color card .
&amp; sk@@ ill@@ show ; is a comfortable image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser where you can choose pictures to display .
pictures can be displayed either in a window in the image of the image or in full screen mode .
the usage of &amp; sk@@ ill@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files to show you with clicking on the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or button return .
you can adjust whether each picture should be displayed in a window or if any images should use the same window .
if you search for a certain file , just type the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame in the browser window . if a matching fil@@ en@@ ame is found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing Return Return , or Es@@ c .
in Dialogue One - &amp; Event show ; there are five cart@@ ons cards . in three of them , General and Handling , and sli@@ deshow . in the two others , short commands for the browser window and short commands for the browser , the short@@ cut for the respective window can be specified .

you can eventually establish the existing multimedia keys so that they work as &amp; am@@ arok ; Review Editor . thereby , you make your keyboard to &amp; am@@ arok ; -@@ Control Center .
the D@@ COP @-@ Interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions which are mostly used in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and should describe the D@@ COP @-@ functions of collection , context @-@ browser , player , play@@ list , play@@ list browser and scripts . a sample call for the D@@ COP function could be &amp; z@@ b ; as look like this :
Amar@@ ok supports the command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; K@@ DE ; in addition Amar@@ ok has several own command line options .
you should give the user a feedback , if the script may not be executed because of a lack of depend@@ ency . please check if all the modules are available and use the dialog , so the user does not run a script .
Beg@@ in Requ@@ ire &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE binding for ruby ) from k@@ de@@ binding trading V@@ 3.4 is Requ@@ ired for this script . &apos; &apos; dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos; exit
in the folder scripts / templates you can find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use it as a base for your own scripts , or simply use them to enlarge the required functions . you will quickly find that the writing of scripts are relatively easy .
using D@@ COP , you can exchange your scripts with amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the sim@@ pl@@ est way is the use of the command d@@ co@@ p ; which should be climbed every K@@ DE installation .
most scripts allow the execute of external programs and commands . this is usually the function ex@@ ec ( ) . in this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; is relatively easy to be called . here is an example in Python :
&amp; am@@ arok ; sends alerts on all running scripts . for this reason , scripts will continue to monitor their standard awarding cases and respond to events . of course , a script may also ign@@ ore the events , if there is no use .
configure the script to display the dialog button . in order to keep the storing and loading the configuration data every script will take care of every script , Amar@@ ok puts the working folder on the folder where all data should be stored .
track@@ change uses that a new piece is all@@ ud@@ ed . the script may now ask &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ COP @-@ functions further information regarding the new piece ( for example , the met@@ ad@@ ata or the unit length ) .
volume Change volume converts a change of volume . the new volume is an integer between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ men@@ ue Tit@@ le : sub@@ menu menu entries to the selected files of the play@@ list , if a user @-@ defined menu entry , if a user @-@ defined menu entry can also be used to remove the D@@ COP @-@ function d@@ co@@ p am@@ arok ( sub@@ menu Language Tit@@ le ) . in order to remove the script , d@@ co@@ p am@@ arok , post@@ men@@ stru@@ al Men@@ u@@ Item ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) .
before &amp; Order is concluded , or if the user stops a script , sends the signal SIG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed for example . for example , storing data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ cord script can also install script packages that can be compressed as script and z@@ b . such pack@@ ets are basically encoded with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ t@@ ar ) that can optionally be identified with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) that the user can clearly recognize the archive as a Amar@@ ok script package .
&amp; am@@ arok ; 1.3 will accept only script packages using the Extended En@@ v@@ able script . from this reason , you should use your script packages equal right .
the main concern must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the t@@ ar parameters -@@ p to obtain the file &apos;s rights :
if your script is ready , you can upload it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org , and hang up the link to the Wik@@ i script side of &amp; am@@ arok ; hanging for your entry on K@@ DE @-@ apps you should use the category of Hear@@ ken ; scripts .
&amp; Order &apos;s arok : is an audio player for &amp; K@@ DE ; awarded &amp; am@@ arok ; has many useful and powerful features and is still sur@@ prisingly easy to use .
with &amp; am@@ arok ; you can easily go through to play@@ list , instead of endless menus . perhaps you may search for a certain title from thousands in your collection . with &amp; am@@ arok ; &apos;s collection browser and the quick search will be found within seconds within seconds .
perhaps you have some play@@ lists , but you can never choose which you want to hear ? then , the play@@ list browser is exactly the right for you . and if you still falls difficult , select the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically choose the right music after certain criteria .

the sub @-@ screen on @-@ screen display allows you to use the power on the O@@ SD . if on @-@ screen display is used , a preview of O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview .
the first option is the font . Click on Select ... to select the font in the dialog for the O@@ SD . the check box causes that the text is sh@@ aded in the O@@ SD .
using your own colors , you can custom@@ ize the O@@ SD @-@ colors for writing and background . a click on colour areas opens the dialog for color selection . if your own colors is not enabled , the pre @-@ set &amp; K@@ DE color is used .
the input field display text is displayed in the O@@ SD . by using space switches the O@@ SD can be adjusted to the own needs . below is a list of available plac@@ eholder and what they mean .
the screen is intended for X@@ in@@ ama users . this means that you can set the O@@ SD multi @-@ monitor environment on which screen may appear .
the ticket card audio output lets you select a audio driver from the selection box . some drivers still choose further options in this map card .
the ticket card collection is used to set all the settings for your collection . this includes the folder and the type of database for the collection .
here you can select the folder , the &amp; am@@ arok ; according to music files . to refer to music files in the collection , check box in addition to his name . this section contains also check boxes for entries as well as selected folders .
browse this folder as well : this causes &amp; am@@ arok ; both the crossed as well as their sub@@ folder will be subject to music .
changes : enables &amp; am@@ arok ; enabling selected folders to monitor the selected folders ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) , an incre@@ mental search is carried out to advance the necessary modifications to your collection .
import@@ ing play@@ lists : causes &amp; am@@ arok ; all found play@@ lists were added into your collection folder ( .@@ pl@@ o and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) which automatically add added play@@ lists later .
the part collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the combination field driver is : can be selected between SQ@@ Lite or MySQL . if MySQL is selected , further facility in the sub@@ window MySQL setup is necessary .
the MySQL institution is used to set the database for &amp; am@@ arok ; used under calcul@@ ator : the computer is set on which the database is reachable via Port : the network port is registered under which the database is available . name : is the database connection to which the connection is manufactured .
use user name : and password : to enter the data collected for the connection to the database .
the ticket strain relief .@@ f@@ m provides the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; am@@ arok ; may transmit the names of played pieces at an last@@ .@@ f@@ m @-@ server and create music recommendations concerning the current unit .

am@@ aro@@ ah requires only the package K@@ deli@@ bs and else no other K@@ DE packages . you need to have K@@ deli@@ bs so installed ( including the programs contained ) , because &amp; am@@ arok ; requires some of them to compiled for example modules or scripts . we have written a small guide , how to comp@@ ile K@@ deli@@ bs minimal .
some features such as the O@@ SD require that your window manager will work the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ ec@@ op@@ .org . we are trying to support am@@ aro@@ que on all platforms , therefore we use K@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , because they are able to provide excellent development environment .
probably , one of your files will make an error in the Tag@@ Li@@ b library to days . you can see the file recovery by taking into ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / am@@ an@@ .@@ log file . after that , you can delete the file on the Tag@@ Li@@ b developers under bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de.@@ org . afterwards , you can delete the file and create the collection once again .
mostly , it lies that Tag@@ li@@ b when reading the Meta @-@ Info from this file system crashing : please tell this mistake to the Tag@@ Li@@ b developers under bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de.@@ org .
if you are using MySQL as a database , then try out SQ@@ Lite . the support for this is a bit more mature .
make sure all of you have been compiled by &amp; am@@ arok ; libraries were compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if e.g. &amp; am@@ arok ; with GCC 3.4 , Tag@@ Li@@ b , but with GCC 3.@@ 3.x , then leads to crash when editing the met@@ a @-@ information .
if you use K@@ DE with art@@ s@@ d , then dis@@ able automatic mode when in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or use at least no value of 1 second .
you can also send the back@@ trace by e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail opens automatically at a crash ) . if it is an frequently occurring crash and send us a good back@@ trace , the error will be fixed .
this is due to write a lot of program data as UTF @-@ 8 in met@@ a @-@ info@@ s , but it is not known as Unicode character . the following Perl script del@@ ays the problem .

&amp; am@@ arok ; s Symbols in the Status Bar / Rest@@ oration / Dynam@@ ical play@@ list . this is a well @-@ known error in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , you can view the status disabled on grey and half transparent . note that in some cases up to three times , you can click on a icon , until setting up their effect .
if you get this error : cat@@ amar@@ an error : cat@@ amar@@ app : un@@ locking symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ ar icon , then check whether am@@ aro@@ K is the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos; which cat@@ amar@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p Q@@ T .
to fix these errors , you may need to fix any col@@ li@@ di@@ ac Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ conf so that am@@ aro@@ K must first find the correct version first .
there are some possibilities . most of the installation problems clari@@ fy your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also use help from other users or developers . use it for the forum and the I@@ RC under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in the Channel # am@@ arok .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please only bear an error if something is located on the object of an error in am@@ aro@@ ah itself .
after the start of &amp; am@@ arok ; there is only a blank play@@ list . how will music pieces now come in ?
this is simple . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the play@@ list .
to keep the surface intu@@ iti@@ vely , the Start window is converted into the statistic window . you can find it under ex@@ tras .
the importance of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars are calculated for the evaluation by the user , while the points will be calculated automatically .
to evaluate pieces , the evaluation box must be displayed in the play@@ list . Click on the title track column and select column . Click here to define the evaluation of a piece set . you can also use the short commands for Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove , and press it on your keyboard . or click on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your selection and then select from playback menu .
drag a play@@ list file with the mouse into the play@@ list and let it fall , just as you would like to make it with other files , just like it is : - )
in the tool@@ bar of the play@@ list , directly next to the button , the button is play@@ list . Click on it .
presumably the program X@@ M@@ MS @-@ config . install the program X@@ M@@ MS @-@ config . install the package X@@ M@@ MS @-@ dev@@ el and install &amp; am@@ arok ; new . watch also after lib@@ visual , this package includes many very nice visu@@ al@@ izations .

no . Yes , that is true ! no ! &amp; am@@ arok ; uses one of the back@@ end independent approach , hence the real question of Which media types does support G@@ stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ or / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you see , we support so pretty every possible audio format . G@@ stre@@ amer can even support text and P@@ NG !
it may be ! maybe you &apos;re using F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , where default is no MP3 decoder . the solution : Alt @-@ F2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 K@@ DE , inclusion
launch the Ya@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . well ... &amp; am@@ arok ; plays MP3 &apos;s from : - )
if you use the G@@ stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa @-@ S@@ ink , the device must provide a mixer . a mixer enables multiple applications to connect the device to the same time and can be done simultaneously through the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or by the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( Software mixer ) . check out the help mix D@@ mix for AL@@ SA .
the issue of this command should help you with the search for the problem and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer you need to specify another sink ( e.g. oss@@ sink ) .
the do@@ orn is done . don &apos;t forget that media must first de@@ coded for most people , you would only listen to a white noise . G@@ asp@@ amer reads the file , de@@ coded them and sends the PCM data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
also X@@ M@@ MS de@@ coded data first . G@@ stre@@ amer can print directly to AL@@ SA , just as x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open sound server with highest priority ( real @-@ time quality ) and increase the size of sound buffer ( see next point of FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ ou@@ tra@@ pper are set :
with K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE@@ Multimedia Co@@ dec@@ s , which can cause distur@@ bed playback . read this mistake report . the Enlarge The Sound Pu@@ ff@@ ers in your AL@@ SA configuration file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help .
either you do not use the Arts driver but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE media to receive the faster Arts Co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc . ) .
probably you use the Arts Dri@@ vers . use a different driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been optimized for Analy@@ zer ) , or reduce the size of the buffer buffer in the control centre and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . ever less the buffer , the less mot@@ ions respond to visu@@ al@@ izations . Yes , this is a mistake , please help us to fix it .
G@@ stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to change the G@@ stre@@ amer driver , is cr@@ ashes &amp; bi@@ otic ; why ?
after the installation of G@@ Stre@@ amer you need to register all components . lead @-@ register to register all G@@ asp@@ amer components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help you can also ask in the I@@ RC channel # g@@ stre@@ amer .
try this ( end am@@ aro@@ que before ! ) : - Download the m@@ peg file , comp@@ iling and install it . delete the module folders ( you will find the module folder with g@@ st @-@ config / g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run @-@ register .

open the dialog &quot; Br@@ ame &quot; for the current project . this dialog is basically the same as the features dialog . the only difference is the additional button Br@@ ass , the &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; to burn the medium . the burn dialog can only be opened if the project has already been data .
open the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can use many project @-@ related settings . every project type has different possible settings , most of them are described above ? ( reachable via the right mouse button ) .
this entry only appears with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it is useful if you &apos;re using files for a multi @-@ session CD . if this function is not used for you , even if this function is not intended for you to see the files already existing and folder .
this entry only appears with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this feature causes &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; , imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project . this function remov@@ es no files from the medium , it ends only the previously imported files .
open the CD copy dialog . this allows you to create copying a CD to another medium . alternatively , you can only copy a copy of a CD on another medium . if you prefer even if you want to copy CDs with damaged sectors or video CDs .
open the DVD copying dialog . this allows you to burn the copying of a DVD to another medium . alternatively , you can only be able to burn only a copy of DVD instead of normal copying . furthermore , you can also be able to burn the target medium large enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source media in the original form .
open the dialog for Del@@ ete a CD @-@ RW . you can delete the entire content or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
open the dialog for form@@ att@@ ing a DVD . with this dialog , you can create a DVD ± R ( W ) which makes the content completely deleted . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; you can over@@ write the choice between the write models and cre@@ di@@ ment@@ ell .
burn a previously made CD image . the dialog asks you to a * .@@ is@@ o , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a data source that can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning b@@ op@@ fs . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not yet supported but you have to use other tools such as Nr@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
bur@@ ns a previously manufacturer DVD copy . the dialog asks for a * .@@ is@@ o file as a source of data , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning b@@ op@@ fs .
a previously used DVD video can be converted to you . this dialog window appears normally after reading a DVD in the content view , but it can also be used below . it contains information on the stored video , co@@ de@@ er settings and even options to modify the size and cut black edges .
shows information about the pic@@ tured medium . these information is shown in the content view , and include characteristics of the media , such as size and title length of CD or DVD .
shows a list of tool bars &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; when an entry is crossed , the tool bar is currently visible in the main window .
when this is crossed , a small vest is shown at the bottom edge of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not crossed , the status bar is b@@ lown off .
if the folder view is on or off . if the folder &apos;s screen saver contains an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives . if the content view is enabled , whose content is displayed in content view . CD / DVD drives have also a context menu with functions such as media information , lock and un@@ lock the drive or thro@@ wing of the media .
if the content view is a or from . the content view allows you to choose and drag files into the projection view . the content is also the interface to read audio or video CDs , if a drive selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view .
switches the head@@ line in the projection view a or out . the head strip is a narrow area , only visible when the projection screen has no real function , it looks pretty pretty and separates the projection view clearly from the other views .
this opens a dialog window for changing the button arrangements for &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; after one of the available commands selected in the upper part , one can adjust the key@@ word to below .
this will kick off the K@@ 3@@ b ; setup assistant . thus , system administrator can be set to burn CDs and DVDs . therefore , system administrator will need to enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) .
opens the settings of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; here , general program settings can be made . almost all the functions of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b . should work on an@@ ie@@ b . this dialog is intended for person@@ al@@ izing and fine tuning program .
&amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; the same as many other &amp; K@@ DE ; applications also , equipped with a &amp; D@@ COP ; interface equipped with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled via a single script .
to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; functions to use , you can either use the command line d@@ co@@ p , or the somewhat more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are crucial in the functional scope , so it &apos;s rather your taste and the kind of tasks are crucial , in which the programs you will give .
in this chapter , we assume that you can use the command line d@@ co@@ p . in order to make use the &amp; D@@ COP ; to make sure you have to make sure that &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; then , give something like the following in the console :
in addition to the general &amp; D@@ COP ; functions , all &amp; K@@ DE ; program common , supported &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two further parts that are described below are described below .
the standard D@@ COP @-@ Interface of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b features functions such as copy@@ CD , format DVD and other functions for creating new projects .

&amp; Audi@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; is a audio CD ; read @-@ out for &amp; K@@ DE , which can be easily saved and stored in MP@@ 3- or OGG files . other sizes are possible , depending on the encoder of the computer .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ( for reading &amp; CD ; files to WAV files on hard disk ) and of many Ko@@ di@@ ers to en@@ code this WAV files ( comp@@ ress the Linux distribution ) . more Ko@@ di@@ ers can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first the titles of the &amp; CD ; read and stored in WAV files on the computer ( loss@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step , this WAV files ( usually one per title ) compres@@ ses in the MP@@ 3- or OGG format or also other formats like loss@@ less FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; is used by &amp; c@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost any distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package if this is not installed , it must now be done now .
for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ ging up ( for OGG ) or other Ko@@ di@@ ers have already been installed . however , all these programs are generally not necessary to comp@@ ile . if , for example FLA@@ C is not used , its installation is not necessary .
what encoding / file format should be used ? chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction of Ko@@ di@@ ers , audio quality and compression factors .
a word for copying of protected audio CD ; s : as already said , uses &amp; audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; for reading the audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not possible to handle any copy protection ; even don &apos;t avoid the mechanisms of the copy protection . simply avoid the purchase of copy protected audio CD ; s !
while setting up only once has to be done ( the configuration dialog , however , can be called as often called up to a proper configuration ) , the daily handling of a &amp; CD is explained on the hard disk . this leads to the hard@@ core approach of the user interface , which you will be proud in the beginning .
can convert many formats - depending on which co@@ ater programs are installed ( MP3 , OGG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can be &amp; CD ; retri@@ eve information from the free@@ DB file or can work completely without network , whereby everything is recorded manually .
this is only a short list of commands of the master window . on the page step by step example , you will find further information as this program is used as well as screen photos with descriptions of the program tab for the configuration of the program .
k@@ icks off the CD@@ DB file upon request by the CD data according to the device card CD@@ DB . ( this may be locally or online , in the latter case must first be manufactured connection to the Internet . )
start reading and when a encoder is configured in the tab card tab . the coding is configured .
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available Encoder which can be read from an other encoder as the standard can be read , that previously the encoder input settings dialog has been configured in the dialog tab .
open the file manager , so that a full file would be selected to en@@ code rather than a full &amp; CD ; read and en@@ code .
open the configuration dialog in order to configure the type of noti@@ fications ( such as protocols , pi@@ ep@@ sen ) for program events ( like reading the &amp; CD ; end ) .
open the main layout dialog of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; with different map cards ( such as Encoder , to set up the En@@ co@@ ders ) . after this , you must go before the program can be used successfully !
this chapter describes audio quality , coding and compression rates and helps you choose the right Ko@@ di@@ er &apos;s choice .
if no audio information is to perish , a loss@@ less audio format is needed . besides FLA@@ C there are others like &apos; sh@@ orts &apos; or &apos; Monkey &apos; which may be available for this distribution . the dis@@ advantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files .
among the audio formats , the information collected by data compression according to their psycho@@ acoustic model are MP3 and OGG the most common . OGG mag is a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but the differences are less important , since both co@@ ders are very good audio quality .
O &apos;@@ no such &apos; free , l@@ ame is still supplied with most distri@@ butions for free , but there are open licence questions
+ high up to very high sound quality ( at high bit rates ) but compared to OGG slightly lower quality at lower depth rates .
OGG - if only music is one of the computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG @-@ playing devices are available .
MP3 - if music is also owned on other devices , such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special car stereo . today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices can only support MP3 format .
a short list of parameters to the audio quality and resulting compression ratios for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer acceptable for most people and most music pieces of acceptable transparency , and has quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set Extreme &apos; = 224 - 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . requires up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and somewhat less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos; --@@ pre@@ set Extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . requires more 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex designs of a tit@@ els . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR common stereo , compression rate about 11 . 128 k@@ bps for all the pieces of a tit@@ els . good enough for music of young people , portable devices and auto@@ oster@@ one plants . but not good enough for better fi stereo .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set ins@@ ane &apos; = 320@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting is ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely do the absolutely highest quality , without respect to the file size , then select this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information , manually entered or collected by the program from Free@@ DB via the Internet , are available as a list of parameters . it can be used as a list of parameters . it can be used to create folders and file names , as well as the characteristics of music files .
in connection with Ko@@ di@@ er@@ programs there is often a combination of program settings for the co@@ ders and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the Ko@@ di@@ ers explain the switch for these programs .
for example to add the &amp; CD ; titles are encoded with l@@ ame ( tag ) if MP@@ 3s must be encoded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ tt is l@@ ame and the title parameter of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; the result looks as follows : &apos; ... -@@ tt { Test } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; parameters that can be used ( = button designation in the assistant ) :
that &apos;s what the Free@@ DB is : a free database , which can read the information up / enter into the host , so that all other these information can be downloaded from the computer itself . it is considered only from text , &amp; CD ; titles , artists , names of the pieces &amp; etc . , not from the audio file itself .
Yes , it should be legal , but I ( An@@ m of the translation : so that is the author ) am not attor@@ ney . however , nobody can prevent that you can damage from the &amp; CD ; and all information can be done by a B@@ um@@ mel by a &amp; CD ; business , physi@@ cally or virtual .
in &amp; audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; is actively to choose a check box ( sending an address ) . in this type of configuration , it seems that the e @-@ mail address will not be used by the server ( this can not only know the programmer that has the code . )
there are many different countries copies of the main database . if &amp; c@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; for the use of Free@@ DB , the geographical distribution is supposed to be used . this saves bandwidth on the network and resem@@ bles the load between the computers .
a visit to Fri@@ ed@@ b.@@ org provides a current list of mirror ver@@ n for online demand of &amp; CD ; information during reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively the entire database can be downloaded or ( usually per month ) only the updates of the database .
which selection program is used to store pieces from the &amp; CD ; to save WAV files on my computer ?
there &apos;s rum@@ ors that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; whoever wants to be more specific to read the source code .... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD ; see . to note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package from the appropriate distribution must be installed first if this has not happened yet .
for saving the stored WAV files , the Ko@@ di@@ ers and hence the desired file format can be selected . during the first opening set the code for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a loss@@ less compression for audio data ) can be added to the encoding of the Ko@@ di@@ er . other co@@ ders can be added to this tab .
the Co@@ aster Package needs to be installed from the appropriate Linux distribution prior to the Ko@@ di@@ erer . this is also available for the pre@@ defined Ko@@ di@@ ers . more information on Ko@@ di@@ ers are in chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
after installing a Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers more information about its switches can be obtained through the input of a command like l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . it must be replaced by the name of the installed Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers .
this may have many reasons . check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive that are installed both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia as well as the audio co@@ ders of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) . try to retri@@ eve both programs with a command line in a terminal . this could give a reference to what is wrong .
check if you don &apos;t want to read a copy protected audio CD ; check out the shell of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , this tips can be done as you must proceed .
if you read the complete manual , everything understood but som@@ eh@@ ow are still un@@ safe what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will prepare enough information to create those areas that you want to make the program exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time to setup all and our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pre@@ set Extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 224 up to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 sample words ( tags ) .
it must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame is already installed on your computer . both programs should be downloaded as a pre @-@ compiled package for your Linux distribution as it is considered a non @-@ free software . anyway , it is not necessary to comp@@ ile the source files , whatever you can do .
please make sure that the directory / us@@ r / share / cd exists and that you have write permission to write ( eg ; trying to copy with the cross @-@ section or anything ) .
the first section deals with the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; something which is probably done only once and
the second section describes the approach to read a &amp; CD ; what has to be repeated for any out &amp; CD ;
here we determine the compression of music ( l@@ ame ) and audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting audio quality ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting audio quality ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting audio quality ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting audio quality ( MP3 ) as well as we are la@@ zy to use the program to download the Free@@ DB files and download data from the Internet .
although we can change these settings anytime , we will probably do it with any reading of a &amp; CD ; if once the matching settings are found .
the device name will be handed over to the reading program to read the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces can be read .
frequently is / dev / c@@ drom a symbolic link on the real device name of your drive . if this is not working or if more than a &amp; CD ; / DVD drive can be set , so , a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab an attempt to install existing entries for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the ticket card General settings . here it &apos;s not much to do . here , an additional transformation can be defined . in our example , everything will be shown as illustrated in the screenshot .
only For in@@ complete information may be asked if you want to be informed when referring to the reference of keywords ( tags ) are missing .
the ticket card CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are convenient and allow the &amp; CD ; download data via the Internet from a Free@@ DB computer .
note : the calcul@@ ator must be connected during the reading of the &amp; CD ; to connect to the Internet , so that it can access to the Free@@ DB server .
the second selection box is simpler , a &amp; CD ; entry found immediately , if you &apos;re un@@ happy with the database @-@ entry , and the fil@@ en@@ ame or fil@@ en@@ ame should be easily changed . the directory and fil@@ en@@ ame is modified with con@@ ques - &gt; ren@@ aming , and the ID3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; K@@ DE .
apart from this example , if you want to enter everything manually , the selection fields and Free@@ DB file is not used . however , the two selection fields must be selected , at least the first selection fields must be selected , at least the first one . the mode will be set up on the following map card .
CD@@ DB is for us Free@@ DB . these are settings for data enqu@@ iry , for the retri@@ eve of the &amp; CD ; information from Free@@ DB server over the Internet . how to know the system which data will get the CD ? read the section about Free@@ DB , see how it is shown in the screen photo .
mode : we don &apos;t have downloaded the database , we only want to work with remote database on the Internet Server .
CD@@ DB server : please go to the page fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org and look after a mirror server nearby . on this way the load between the machines will be distributed as the first attempt .
both work as well as for the server , as many fire@@ wall marks the protocol 88@@ 80 according to default , there are perhaps more fortun@@ ate with the protocol 80 , as the &amp; HTTP ; protocol usually is open to surf in the Internet .
in this example , we want to transfer &amp; CD ; data to the Free@@ DB server . the first check box should be enough .
simply take the settings of screenshot . ( make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer )
number of simultaneous pieces : exc@@ use for exc@@ use , is there a reason why more than one at the same time when using only one existing drive ? parallel reading and en@@ code ? the author knows it not so easy to try .
CD ; check out after reading the last piece : cross this to the &amp; CD ; at the end of the trial .
custom file for temporary files : if you cross the check@@ box , then the path can be stored in which the WAV files can be stored . if the box is not enabled , the files will not be installed in the private folder . don &apos;t forget this folder when you want to make something with WAV files .
all the way as it is on the screen photo . the command is somewhat long , under circumstances should be blo@@ omed slightly towards the right .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set Extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of MP@@ 3s . as previously mentioned , this is an setting for very good audio quality , even for very good HiFi stereo systems . the result is a good balance between audio quality and storage consumption .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; to restri@@ ct the creation of tags on version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &quot; Tags : in case of later use of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the inputs ( including the complete path ) and the output file ( including the complete path ) .
put the rest as in the screen photo . some comments for future use outside of this example :
number of simultaneous WAV files : with a Du@@ al@@ core or Quad @-@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine can be tried to en@@ code more than a WAV file at the same time .
this is , we just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; this configuration will be used as a standard for any reading of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organiz@@ ational structure of your music , you never need them to change again .
this section is described , as the process of the reading of the &amp; CD ; it is set up on the hard disk . first , we will be able to recover files on the hard disk , as we are convenient and the &amp; CD ; data from the Free@@ DB file is described , and the process that is described in this section must be repeated for any out &amp; CD ;
since we have a &amp; CD ; do not include the screen photos a little different than those for a &amp; CD ; with successfully aired by Free@@ DB , you will learn how to retri@@ eve data from the Internet instead of using the Internet . comments are displayed on the differences .
don &apos;t try out the &amp; CD ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this hand@@ book .
if this has not happened yet , now the &amp; CD has to be defined in the drive that has been defined in the main window .
after a short moment , the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as in the screen photograph , this only if the &amp; CD ; as audio CD ; identified and could be read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this is not done , look for questions and answers after the help or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings .
attention : if the &amp; CD ; successfully used by the Free@@ DB , all titles of the pieces are already completed and in addition the name of the artist and the album is shown .
for the case , it &apos;s more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; key to your &amp; CD ; there will be a window embedded , and you can choose the database entry , which your opinion is best on your &amp; CD ;
if you do not select the check box for automatic query from Free@@ DB ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings dialog for Settings ) , you can also select this manually by choosing the first an@@ op@@ fs in the tool@@ bar . if you pick no local database , but require the connection to the Internet .
E 1.2 Step 2 : the CD @-@ Editor - input of the CD data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; accordingly to the pattern on the next screen photo . the title of the piece in the first row of the input field &apos; Update title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; .
the artist must not be entered in the input field &apos; Update title &apos; unless you have an arrangement with different artists for each piece .
the lower commentary box can be used for the individual comments ini@@ di@@ ally per piece , the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply to all the pieces of the CD .
cau@@ tion : after successful withdrawal of data from the Free@@ DB file , the CD editor is not empty , but it is always a good idea to start the content of the CD @-@ Ed@@ itors ( e.g. if all words with capital letters start or not ... ) , but also to examine whether there is any undes@@ ired remarks .
note : in this example we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this is limited to the length of the fields , Album , and Tit@@ le of a piece and on only 28 characters for the comment . this option will be set up to the Ko@@ di@@ er@@ er@@ er@@ Settings tab . take a look at the dialog tab .
you can change the day information of the generated files at any time with the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .

just select an entry obviously with the style of the trigger CD ; in this example , it is not important that we can &apos;t exceed the &amp; CD ; for more information go to the Internet website . pop or .@@ ap . for example , you can find under Rock .
after selecting &apos; OK &apos; you come back to the main window . just click on the line with the second piece .
the window of the CD @-@ Ed@@ itors appears again and you see that the fields for the album is already filled with the entered data , which we wish for the first piece . specify the item for the fields of the current piece . if you wish to request the item for each case and other information you wish .
Click on the next row in the main window and process in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD ;
warning : this window appears not when you downloaded the data from the Free@@ DB file . it is already sorted into one of these categories .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the third button of the tool bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note that the artist and the album will be shown above the piece list . &quot; &quot; &quot;
note that there is a check @-@ in before each line of a piece . only the titles are selected , and make sure all the pieces are selected , or ass@@ orted the button All the pieces select at the bottom edge of the screen to select all the pieces at once .
by clicking on the button selection process , this window appeared on the button . then click OK and then let &apos;s see a look at the window with the ess@@ ays and track what is going on .
Click on the rider &apos;s orders for switching on the job window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the tool@@ bar .
this is the window on check of orders . the first piece is set out onto the hard disk . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status line .
this error message you will see if you are attemp@@ ting to work with a co@@ erer , which you have not installed yet . plays are not successfully encoded with a red &apos; X &apos; in the list list .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the target folder are not what we have entered here in example . have you checked if you have a write access to the temporary files and target folder ? ; - )
now it is clear that the error occurred directly after the end of the reading of the first piece .
the order 1 reads the first piece that it is finished . but we have made a new entry : order 4 is the coding of pieces 1 into the format MP3 . thus , read and coding in parallel . note the status of the bottom part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has no configuration settings to instru@@ ct this behaviour , the number of parallel processes to read and en@@ code . with high performance machines , the calcul@@ ator with an AM@@ D@@ 64 seems to have no problem with simultaneous reading and en@@ code ( however , two different pieces ) .
now , the last title will be read , while another piece is coded , and a third order is encoded in the qu@@ eu@@ e @-@ long of the body . after the last piece is coded , a little window will be filled with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; audio audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; you &apos;ll need &amp; K@@ DE ; 3.@@ x@@ . or 4.x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to generate compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG , you need the code of your choice .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; if you have known as part of the auto @-@ media package , you can download from there an anonymous copy here . most distribution boxes are already a pre @-@ compiled package , as &amp; c@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; a part of an important &amp; K@@ DE , package . if you read this , you &apos;ve probably already done it ...
this section is aimed at people who comp@@ iling from source files , and do not think for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are searching for assistance according to your needs , if it runs once , the following is right for you :
a program that calls for many different programs , has many variations of settings . on the best , read the step by step example to know the options and settings . it shows screen photos of different map cards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the sample .
hello , still on reading ? even if only the help menu was clicked on the initial start of the program , without any reference point such as it is going to pass from this som@@ eh@@ ow ( especially if at the time of program boot does not include audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from the un@@ usually short menu ?
what does it work ? who reads this , probably the program has to start . it should look something like this :
a bad example : unfortunately no e @-@ mail . the author can &apos;t stop this manual ; it &apos;s first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; may it be done . at least , after contact with the author . and if you read this , he has left this section and is therefore agree with this suggest@@ ion .
strange if you managed to recover the source file from &amp; K@@ DE , SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need these information , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MID@@ I@@ - and Car@@ a@@ ok@@ esp@@ iel@@ er of &amp; K@@ DE ; beside others , it has also some features that do not have other features , the other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players don &apos;t have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; K@@ DE ; supports the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ as@@ ound project drivers which is needed for G@@ US cards . Al@@ sa is involved as soon as it supports a sequ@@ enz@@ er .
&amp; k@@ mid ; shows the songs on the screen with changing color , so it is easy to follow the piece .
graphic representation of any MIDI channel by using advanced keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop so that you can drag in &amp; K@@ DE ; any MIDI file from a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Window to drag .
supports the two existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( son@@ ography experiences or texts ) . K@@ Mid determin@@ es automatically the procedure applied .
session support . if you end &amp; K@@ DE , while playing a song , K@@ Mid starts again with the same song in the next time .
supports external MIDI syn@@ thesizer , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter , you need the LU@@ P drivers and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can open ... from the File menu . it appears the usual file dialogue with which you can choose the desired song .
you can also let a file from a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window will fall into the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window will also work simultaneously with several songs simultaneously .
to play a music piece , open it and ass@@ orted the button shut@@ ters in the tool@@ bar , select the entry you play from the menu piece , or ass@@ orted the clay paste .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; one piece will start automatically , as soon as you go to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window . ( with multiple pieces , they are added to a collection and played in one another . )
once &amp; k@@ mid ; one piece plays , you can jump on any spot by using the middle mouse button and drive away with the kno@@ b .
if you find that a song can be played quickly or slowly , you can change to the arrows on the left and right of the speed . to get the original speed , double @-@ click on the speed .
the space bar has two tasks : if one piece is played , a pressure on the empty space is played like a pressure on the kno@@ b or the exit of the menu , so the playback is played , while no piece is played , k@@ icks off &amp; k@@ mid ; playback .
lyrics can be stored on two ways in one piece of music . some pieces use textile portrait , others use lyrics and another both . some pieces have no text : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can adjust , which events will be displayed , and even better : the event type will automatically determine which a song is used , so you can &apos;t adjust the kar@@ aoke text . but you still have the opportunity to change that if you want to see the other way .
if you want to adjust a event type , select from the menu settings the entries , texts and rec@@ itals . the same function also have the keys 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files that you summar@@ ize . these will be played through the series . in this section , how you can use the collections .
to create a collection , first open the collection manager . this can be found in the menu collection under the item . Click here to New and give the name to the collection .
you can also copy a existing collection by clicking on copying and then specify the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs like the original ones .
if you have more than a collection , you can set the set@@ ups on the collecting manager .
in the temporary collection all the songs you want to add to any other collection .
when leaving the application , this collection is not saved . consider the if you add many pieces .
to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in collecting manager . there you can add a song in the way . it appears again the file dialogue with which you can choose the desired song .
a second method to add a song , depends on the attitude of automatic add to the collection .
if automatic add to the collection is activated , a piece of opening ( using file opening or drag &amp; drop ) is automatically added to the active collection .
if automatic add @-@ on to the collection is enabled , when opening a piece set the temporary collection is enabled , and the collection will then be added to the un@@ opened pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and select the desired song and then click on button Remove .
you can select the order in which the songs will be played . if you are playing the sequence of the menu collection , the songs will be played in the order , as they added to the collection .
if you add songs or remove or acci@@ dental order in the menu , the order will be re@@ set .
to play a song , select the collection manager or use the selection list above the kar@@ aoke text .
to jump to song , select the button next song , the entry next song from the menu piece or press the arrow right .
to jump to a song , select the button pre @-@ piece one , the entry previous piece from the menu piece or press the arrow left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection , and click the button to delete .
the temporary collection can &apos;t be deleted . however , it doesn &apos;t matter how they will not be saved when leaving &amp; k@@ mid ;
this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thes@@ izers , which are non @-@ MIDI capable . in this case the MIDI @-@ Map General @-@ MIDI events are translated into events that under@@ stands the syn@@ thesizer .
for example , you can create a MIDI map that converts all the events of the Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et &apos;s events , making it always a trumpet sn@@ ares , when originally a piano should play .
if you only have a sound@@ card , you don &apos;t need MIDI @-@ Map because all sound cards are GM compatible ( including A@@ we - and G@@ US maps , FM devices and so on ) .
sorry , there is no programs to create MIDI maps . so , you need to edit the corresponding file of your hand ( with your favorite movies ) .
a MIDI @-@ Map is a text file , which stores all required requirements for playing a unit .
each section may only be released except the KE@@ Y@@ MAP section , which often appears as desired . the requirement for this is , however , that every occurr@@ ence has different text ID ( see below ) .
fin@@ s P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MAP &quot; Name of the Key@@ map &quot; ... Continue reading EN@@ D De@@ fine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... EN@@ D options ... EN@@ D ...
they see that de@@ ph@@ ins is needed to show that a section begins ( except for options ) and EN@@ D , that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your Map @-@ file as an e @-@ mail , so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support for devices that are non @-@ MIDI compatible .
in this section , the patches written by General MIDI to be shown to your specific keyboard . the general use will look as follows :
please note that the left side of the equal sign is ig@@ no@@ red . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the right order ( from 0 to 127 ) , you may not change the order and also no line for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ key@@ s@@ To M is needed to put all tones that will need this instrument on the tone with the number M ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which can take you like a shot , add the following in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP section :
for example , if a MIDI file is to play a note with patch 127 ( ri@@ fl@@ ank ) , patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the tone 60 , ir@@ respective of which clay is available in the MIDI file .
please note that here with the term drum patch of patch included , if any sound is a different perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ary instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ als , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) , and not the one that means the pitch of the same drum means ( like him some keyboards ) .
KE@@ Y@@ MAP section is used to specify how to be m@@ apped on a specific channel or instrument . the use is :
like the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the order of lines is very important , likewise the presence . you must create 128 entries .
you can define multiple Key@@ boards for each channel and using multiple keys only in the first row .
Key@@ boards are mainly used to rep@@ lic@@ ate sounds on the per@@ focus channel . check out the key@@ note as an example .
this section can be used to view some channels on other side . if you want to replace the first and second channel , make it easy to change in the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section .
however , these settings are useful for keyboards , which have the percussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI on Channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , constructed according to the following pattern :
n is the channel , which is shown on the Channel N . if you use the key@@ map option , you will continue to change the key@@ map correctly in the file . if you try the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will ign@@ ore the patch on this channel . in this case , patch x is used .
the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful for instance to use the per@@ verse @-@ patch on the per@@ focus channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch Ben@@ ch rati@@ o are multiplied in which proportion of Pit@@ ch Ben@@ der &apos;s events , if a MIDI file is comp@@ uted with the value n , this is used with formula n * ( r / 4096 ) and then used only . the value 4096 is used , so that in the map file is not dec@@ imal number ) .
this setting is needed , because GM is presenting a keyboard , which is a pitch way to play a ton higher . unfortunately , some keyboards up to one oc@@ tave higher can be played . in order to try the correct value on your keyboard , you need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid ; try out .
to use a MIDI map , just open the MIDI settings . you can find in the menu under Settings , point MIDI settings
the channel view is a window with a number of piano pieces ( one for each MIDI channel ) . you can see that sounds are just played .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a certain channel . if you have changed an instrument , the button is not changed green but red , to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used .
the channel view has ( until now ) shows two different views to view the played tones . you can choose the menu settings under the Point channel view : settings
pace @-@ LCD displays the speed , with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
you can change the pace of a song . if you can find it , a song be too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the pace , use the arrows on the left and right of the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file which contains information about how a music piece has to be played . it contains the notes , rhythm , speed , &amp; etc . so , the same MIDI file can lead to very different results as well as two different musicians can play in very different ways .
well , I am able to force ni@@ em@@ anden , &amp; k@@ mid ; but you need to use a typical MIDI file ( 1 : 80 ) and a good syn@@ thesizer . with a MIDI file you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc . you have the control of everything .
this can happen if you have a binder distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) of &amp; k@@ mid ; because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support , you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos;s home )
I would like to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files separately .
login , therefore supports &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . just open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window .
necessarily , activate the adjustment Automatic Adding add to the collection . otherwise , the files are added to the temporary collection .
you can touch the arrow button on the left side of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow the playback . to restore the standard temp@@ o you can double to the LCD .
I have a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window with my MIDI file and &amp; k@@ mid ; if I want to play a MIDI file ( if I want to play a MIDI file ) or if I want to play a file , only entered the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window , and select the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid ; .
if you want to listen to a file , without add them directly to a collection , switch the option Autom@@ atically add to the collection , and the new ; file will add to the temporary collection . opening files
let &apos;s assume you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mi@@ d. You only want to play the first file . so , select the setup of Autom@@ atically add to the collection and then open your temporary collection just like this a MIDI file .
then join the B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid &apos; playback and create a collection of all three files . how do you do it ?
these people have sent me MIDI files or postcards . all the thank you ! if I see these songs or see the postcard , animated me further to &amp; k@@ mid ; to program .

if you want to know where they can download MIDI / kar@@ aoke files , if you want a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you want to make me happy , write an e @-@ mail : lar@@ pink @ k@@ de.@@ org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ ra@@ is@@ .@@ es

a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer , as the sound quality is dependent on your sound card . it is not the same if you use a FM device or AW@@ E card .
if you have no sound card , you have to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ mid ; with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DEM@@ O _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it then runs as if you could have a sound card , except you can &apos;t listen to music .

the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there are always the window with the central view . alternatively , there is a window with the play@@ list . and finally there is a information window that will be displayed only if information is recovered .
it is possible to drag the preferred connections under the menu book@@ marks , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries , which should be played by each other , then you should use the category weather play@@ list .
of course , you can add groups to groups to receive an additional hier@@ og@@ ly@@ ri@@ fe . if you copied an entry , his group and all his sub@@ sets of the current category will be copied and the playback starts with the attached entry .
the categories &apos; current pieces &apos; , television and long play@@ list can also be changed by direct editing of XML configuration files . of course , one can only do if &amp; k@@ m@@ player / , you can easily choose from the menu View and the next processing mode . by clicking a sub @-@ group , only the XML content will be displayed this part .
after changing the XML files , you must choose from the menu and select either the editing mode , or select a different category .
all changes are lost if the processing mode is left or select a different group without delay the play@@ list .
as a result of the convenience of the author of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; some features can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files .
the animation at starting and finish can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ in c and change from &#91; general Options &#93; No in@@ tro = 0 ob@@ iger option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not available , it can be inserted simply inserted .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; m@@ m@@ player ; will observe the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / file .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . format must be a supported XML file .
the animation at the start does not need to be short , it will be terminated automatically by opening another source . this would be , at the end @-@ animation , the user can therefore stop the application a second time .

there is a rider to configuration of M@@ Player in the configuration dialog for &amp; k@@ m@@ player . here , the path can be adjusted from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data flow from the network and other things .
another tool for troub@@ les@@ hooting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of k@@ m@@ player . here &apos;s the output of m@@ player .
there is no rider for this ren@@ dition in the configuration dialog for &amp; k@@ m@@ player . everything must be configured by manual edit the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ in . here is an example like a &apos; flash &apos; with the module strings Mozilla with :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played inside &amp; m@@ apped ; you can even add the special field to YouTube in play@@ list XML .
in order to play the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages , the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; module must be specified as a service provider for the M@@ ime type application / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash in the setup dialog box of K@@ DE .
the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; can be programmed in a consoles and after error messages related to the charging of the browser module library . if no error occur here , the back@@ end edition is within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) .
this is always a pre@@ determined back@@ end for a certain M@@ ime type ( of course only if it was also determined ) , this must be done by manual trans@@ missions of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ in . for example , phon@@ one should play all og@@ g files :
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; can play TV cards manually , either using M@@ Player or X@@ video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be configured to use the utility device and the TV channels you can manually be edited manually or the configuration file can be edited manually .
for configur@@ ing V@@ DR ( video data Rek@@ order ) settings in the k@@ m@@ player dialog , the dialog box can be found in the settings of - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le@@ - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . there ought to be detected , of which one name has to be selected ( e.g. it is PAL for Western Europe ) , the correct name probably contain a DVB .
since the V@@ DR support of k@@ m@@ player can only use X@@ video ( probably this type of reading of video equipment under Linux ) should work properly . for this reason , the video@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension refers to the X server . for the XFree86 server , it must therefore be contained in its configuration file ( / etc / X11 / XF@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) .
internally used by KM@@ Player for the sources different names . at the time of emergence of this documentation , dv@@ d@@ are source , source source , source source , source source , source source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ ector source . when they are activated , they start playing play@@ list .
are there reasons how to make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter when I play from him ( not of the VCD : / / ) ?
Yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ e 8 / dev / c@@ drom is root as user root according to the plug@@ ging of the device . it is absolutely sure to make / dev / c@@ drom on the CD@@ ROM drive .
X@@ ine only starts slowly , why must my CPU be checked for their performance ?

here just a good report to &amp; Lat@@ ex ; is it not the ultimate book about it . to speak &amp; Lat@@ ex ; you should have good bor@@ row@@ ed , such as H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. Dal@@ y , A Guide to &amp; Lat@@ ex ; : Document Management ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Users , 3rd Edition , 1999 d@@ af@@ Ã ¼ r .
the same as other features includes &amp; Lat@@ ex ; an introduction , with which the gener@@ alized properties like paper format , page number@@ ing and text gr@@ abs are specified as such as paper format , side number@@ ing and text gr@@ abs , with the command \ \ Beg@@ in { Document } and must be closed again with the command \ \ Beg@@ in { Document } and must be closed again .
the fast @-@ level assistant of &amp; k@@ ile ; is a great feature for the fast creation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; the selection of the documentation is responsible for creating the document . it can also be made some of the document related to the document .
documentation : this will indicate the type of the document that are known : articles ( law ) , letter &#91; letter &#93; , report &#91; copy &#93; , article ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ er@@ pr@@ t &#93; , report ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ er@@ pr@@ t &#93; , projector &#91; be@@ amer &#93; , fo@@ ster &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or custom .
coding : this will apply the encoding of the system . modern systems use UTF @-@ 8 encoding as standard . best , UTF @-@ 8x should be used ( for correct processing of &amp; lat@@ ex ; documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used par@@ c@@ els for &amp; lat@@ ex . for the integration , they can be balanced only in the check box .
article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( in compliance with German DIN rules ) . you should always use the preparation of German texts .
new users are now unable to worry . it is only a short description of the functions and further information regarding the following section are given in section .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers - same as other source editors used for the source of the commands , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ) . by &amp; k@@ ile , it is not yet noted by the modest appearance of the output file . however , you will be able to reduce the output of the output file . however , you &apos;ll be able to save you through the high@@ lighting times and times .
with the automatic completion of the environments , when entering a new command set ( e.g. \ \ Beg@@ in { command } ) of &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically creates a spaces ( for example \ \ \ { command } ) . this function can be disabled in the program settings ; set @-@ in ... La@@ Te@@ X commands are disabled .
all documents are usually divided into several elements . &amp; Lat@@ ex ; encourage the sub@@ division of the document into the following items ( part is the whole and sub@@ divided element ) :
with the view of the document in the structural view , the single elements can be changed and viewed by a mouse click on the respective icon .
when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be very helpful in the creation of your own &amp; lat@@ ex . once a DVI ; file &#91; straight un@@ folded file &#93; has been created , jumps &amp; k@@ ile ; by one click with the middle mouse button in DVI ; -@@ viewing the corresponding line in &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code .
a DVI ; file contains a description of the format document and also other information as the font type and is available in addition to PDF the information output type of &amp; tex ; or &amp; Lat@@ ex ; there are many tools for view , transformation and printing from DVI ; files for different systems and devices .
when using the x file , the elements of the DVI ; file can be clicked on an element in the DVI ; file extension is the exact opposite of it . once on a section in the &amp; Lat@@ ex ; source code , it is displayed to the appropriate section in DVI ; -@@ viewer .
Master @-@ Document : this function will be used at work with several files . using a master @-@ document , the work is simplified with other embedded .@@ tex files . when using a project a project @-@ wide master @-@ document can be adjusted project settings .
fast : the &amp; Lat@@ ex ; source code will be compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( unless any errors contained in the source code ) .
file recovery : in this mode , the DVI ; file on open @-@ cr@@ un@@ â , @-@ by @-@ red and it is not a call by &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; according to the quick installation .
when looking for the Edit tool@@ bar , the three large @-@ scale selection criteria should be developed into the document . the first selection field was developed for quick break@@ down of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... The applicable &amp; Lat@@ ex ; commands for the sub@@ division are :
the selection box is further available for items such as keywords , fu@@ zzy @-@ fish , or references . the options are :
name : this command is used for a section , a picture or different element .
terms : if reference is used for reference to a specified name ( selection of a selection box ) .
when using quote , a selection list with literary entries will be displayed . the author has good experiences with &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; and the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files are also written in &amp; k@@ ile ; copied by hand .
the last selection box with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ e is used for the definition of the font , which will be specified on the main text , the fox , etc . , are the following fonts to the author :
at the call of &amp; k@@ ile ; two selection options for disc@@ ol@@ ities : 1 . the Assistant for creating a new document by selecting the document type and legend of the settings . 2 . the document may be written down by the hand .
the brackets according to the command \ \ docum@@ ent@@ class contain the settings for the command . setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; specifies the font . if the font is set down at the beginning , this can also be done even in the text .
once the above mentioned source example , the &amp; Lat@@ ex ; source code must be compiled ; the sim@@ pl@@ est way to this is the use of the program of construction or the button .
the source code must be stored in front of comp@@ ile . &amp; k@@ ile ; for storing the storage is generated automatically .
the compilation of the document must be sought in the protocols that should be sought after the errors . when using quick construction , &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece should be started automatically . if it is not the case , it should also be considered the log period .
one environment ( English environment ) is a text that is treated differently than the rest of the document . for example , the command \ \ Beg@@ in { environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ end { environment ) is supposed to have a different font by the font in the surroundings â ( English Hu@@ ge ) .
the changes will only be made within the vicinity ( of \ \ Beg@@ in { environment } until \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no decision type ( number ) for children in a environment .
there are many denom@@ inations for an increase of read@@ ability and us@@ ability of the document . for example , certain fonts , grease , ital@@ ized , etc . add these commands either with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ Beg@@ in { emp@@ h } : this command is closed for short and long as long as long until it is closed with a \ \ \ { emp@@ h } or another environment . one single word in one set can be represented using \ \ emp@@ h { Word } .
\ \ Qu@@ ote : created a quote in document . the quote starts with \ \ Beg@@ in { Qu@@ ote } and ends with \ \ end { Qu@@ ote } .
after the background to writing the source text with the &amp; Lat@@ ex ; recording language , a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; k@@ ile ;
as soon as the assistant was entered a little text , a few adjustments that should be done better for the better read@@ ability of the document . these things ought to be a quote , some places in the fat and cur@@ sive pressure and a po@@ em to the application to see the differences of these commands .
once the document has been viewed , it can be returned to Editor &apos;s editor or C@@ tr@@ l Editor ( the internal viewer must be closed ) .
once the DVI ; file created , the document may print or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file can be converted . simply try and made fun .
DVI ; is a straight file format ( English D e V ice I n@@ ay ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; Lat@@ ex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi Edition such as printer , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF conversion or computer monitors .
for printing a &amp; DVI ; file the same steps as for creating the document ( see ) . in the 7th step - after clicking on DVI , the document may print ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the tool@@ bar displays the conversion of DVI ; file in other formats . once the DVI ; file from the &amp; Lat@@ ex ; source code was created , the conversion into w@@ asted other formats can begin with the buttons in the tool@@ bar .
the links to the editor &apos;s direct jump from the editor to the right @-@ to @-@ line position within the DVI ; -@@ file .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers a corresponding attitude for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; file files . only Modern of Settings can be set up in the box ... tools construction .
to search the pre@@ face of search , the mouse has to be positioned in a row of the source text and then connect to pre @-@ search on pre @-@ search . the jump to the corresponding point in DVI ; viewer is then so@@ ber .
this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; used in DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; Lat@@ ex ; document of &amp; k@@ ile ; used and used for the corresponding line of the button . this needs to be specified &amp; check@@ ered ; in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; used as text editor ( settings .. Editor )
should the use of quick connection of the &amp; DVI ; viewer can not be displayed , an error may occur . if the log file is shown in the log file , or in the message window .
the log file extension refers to the error source in the source text . in the Editor , the log file will always be displayed , in which the error appears . in order to examine the faul@@ ty line , the error must be clicked on the error in the protocol , navigating immediately to the error line .
once you clicked on the respective button in the tool@@ bar , a window will be used to choose the template for the document . the default sector is :
a document may be made from le@@ a document either from the reason to new or the assistant to fast creation of a new document . further information are included in the section .
strong users of &amp; Lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be created in &amp; k@@ ile ; created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , you have to create an existing &amp; tex ; - / Lat@@ ex ; file can be created or create a new file using existing document and selection of file template from document .
when creating a new document by file New , some character labels will be replaced by other data ( e.g. name or drawing encoding ) . these variables can be set in settings ... settings General .
in creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know the strings of which variables are replaced :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ T TC@@ LA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ : this character string is replaced by entering the document class . typically they are used by entering a document class : \ \ docum@@ ent@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ TC@@ LA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ &#93; { 77 } .
the eas@@ iest way to create a template is the use of assist@@ ants and the therefore associated items in the Editor . once the document was done thus , the following steps can be completed :
when creating a new document , your own template can then be selected instead of the default sector .
a template can be created from any &amp; Lat@@ ex ; files will be created . a simple way to create a template should be searched for one on the Internet and the steps described below are described in the following steps .
they use &amp; Kate ; Kate ; as internal editor . &amp; Kate ; is a text editor for programmers of reading and approach from many different types of text files ( including &amp; Lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for &amp; Kate ; can be made directly from &amp; k@@ ile .
in order to learn more about Kate Win@@ s &amp; Kate . you should learn to visit the manual of Kate &apos;s book . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; you can get there directly with the reading of the chapter by Kate &apos;s chapter .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; command reference which can be called for the program help La@@ Te@@ X Reference , which includes almost all commands that can be found in &amp; lat@@ ex ; use well as their syntax .
a double @-@ click with printed C@@ tr@@ l key to choose the &amp; tex ; meaning that this is to use \ \ par \ \ certified sk@@ ip only \ \ par to \ \ par \ \ certified sk@@ ip .
when pulling the text with printed left button of the button , the selected text is automatically copied to clip@@ board .
when using the arrow keys with printed switching button , to be balanced parts of the source text in the editorial window .
&amp; k@@ ile ; has the opportunity to browse the most diverse types of source texts and these emphas@@ ized . for example , the &amp; Lat@@ ex ; commands from the normal text and also the mathematical form@@ ulas are highlighted by another color .
many assist@@ ants can be shown . this is an own kind of book@@ marks within the text . this is highlighted by the short@@ cut of the short@@ cut or the last spr@@ int . this will also be highlighted by the first input of a character .
the edit is probably one of the main aspect of using a program like &amp; k@@ ile ; . although &amp; Kate ; important functions for the writing of a &amp; Lat@@ ex ; used to under@@ take many environments and therefore , special commands for their selection . the following commands are the following commands to choose from the following commands :
if you have a complete sub@@ section ( group of lines that contain on both sides an empty line ) . this advanced importance is close to sp@@ readsheets , &amp; Lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands and all other lines of the source text , the only noticeable thing in &amp; k@@ ile , is there@@ with that the bodies are separated by two empty lines .
w@@ anders the word under the current cur@@ sor position . this selection has also expanded importance as this command is also &amp; Lat@@ ex ; commands with a white bed ( \ \ ) and a similar star ( * ) at the end .
for example , part of a part of the document can be removed nat@@ Ã ¼ r@@ ently and through Dr@@ Ã ¼ ons of the key . &amp; Kate ; offers with its own commands for a faster speed . under editing the following commands are contained in the text :
remov@@ es a complete paragraph . the definition for a sub@@ section in &amp; k@@ ile ; is contained in the description to edit sheets .
it was already clear that environments is a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore , &amp; k@@ ile ; for further commands under Edit environment for easy work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; .
with this command , at the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly before the command to open the environment .
with this command , at the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to connect the environment .
if the cur@@ sor before or within the command of \ \ Beg@@ in { surroundings } is located at the end of the environment meetings ( or vice vers@@ a ) .
when entering a lot of pre@@ ach@@ ting ambient commands , this command can be lost quickly to the surrounding environment . this command is close to the most recently operational environment that will not be used for the surrounding ambient structure .
&amp; k@@ ile ; provides also special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups that are designed by cl@@ amps . on the Te@@ X Group , some important commands are to match the surrounding area .
with this command , the start of the current group convers@@ ations ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the opening bracket .
with this command , the end of the current group convers@@ ations ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the pe@@ aked cl@@ amps .
when the cur@@ sor before or behind the sw@@ elling clamp of a &amp; tex ; group # is located , to the other end of the group convers@@ ations ( or vice vers@@ a ) .
when entering a lot of used groups , groups can get rid of the vast groups . this command is close to the last changed group , so the wor@@ ship@@ ed structure of the &amp; tex ; groups cannot be stopped .
in &amp; Lat@@ ex ; there are two simple administration characters . for the purpose of purpose , the sign is used in &amp; k@@ ile ; the sign is &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; conf@@ used this case , and for two sleeping equipment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; lat@@ ex . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this automatic injection can be set up under the settings of the box ... La@@ Te@@ X can be switched and switched off .
it can also refer to the specific settings ( e.g. n@@ ée or French ) and there@@ with German or French suits . there are also many other languages available .
when switching from Shift + En@@ vy , an intelligent line breaks . if the current position is located within an lists ( e.g. en@@ um@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , not only one line breaks , but at the same time the command \ \ item .
connect inside a Tab@@ les with a \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
even better - &amp; k@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to support pre @-@ set &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or user @-@ defined environments . these can be set up under settings ; set @-@ up ...
some user m@@ apped the columns in tables and thereby all E@@ t @-@ signs ( amp ; ) can be arranged to each other . although this number is not too ad@@ mir@@ able . although this tab@@ ulator is not allowed to add &amp; k@@ ile ; some intermediate space for the columns has added to the current Tab@@ ul@@ ators .
although &amp; Kate ; already a good source code of understanding has been installed in &amp; styles ; for example , three different modes have been installed . all these modes can be used for various working methods , including all modes of working or settings ...
when you start a new environment using the command \ \ Beg@@ in { surroundings } &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically add the command \ \ end { environment } after an empty line ( for the text ) .
when printed , the last character of the input will be removed and m@@ illed to the list . on the other hand , the list can also be resi@@ zed by entering a further letters .
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions are being removed , so that a simple jump to these positions is well @-@ controlled , and the parameters will then be frozen and the parameters will then be frozen .
set up with settings ; set up ... k@@ ile ; fill in the settings of these lists . you can read various cr@@ ates lists for &amp; tex ; - und &amp; Lat@@ ex ; commands as well as the instructions of common language use .
the command mode is not to be entered for the processing of environments with \ \ Beg@@ in , and the call of the complete list is used as often . on the other hand , the environments is so often used so that &amp; k@@ ile ; a special mode for disc@@ ern@@ ment of the environments .
when call the complete control mode , the command button is set automatically and it appears to \ \ Beg@@ in . afterwards , the ambient temperature will continue to the sim@@ pl@@ est way and then the ambient temperature is continued and through the input of the input .
once this is completed , the environment will be closed automatically . once &amp; k@@ ile , recognizes that it is a list environment , even the first \ \ item command can be inserted .
apply to cra@@ cks ; set up ... k@@ ile ; complete settings to these lists are made . this mode used the list of reference mode for r &amp; tex ; - und &amp; Lat@@ ex ; commands .
&amp; k@@ ile ; under@@ line custom lists of cr@@ abs that can be replaced immediately by l@@ ashing characters . as an example , the file is ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , for example the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included .
for example , the letter L is entered and the word complete set is replaced by the complete tracking mode or the short@@ cut of C@@ tr@@ l + Alt living space , the letter L will be replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X character string .
big bags are not helpful . however , the fact that many whales were written in a document read more than once again . thus , &amp; k@@ ile , all of you have already written comprehen@@ sible .

PS files are not as known as PDF files , but offer an outstanding basis for all @-@ changes and orders of pages . the PDF output files are new , so the pages are newly arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools are new and then converted with ps@@ 2@@ pdf into a PDF file .
in order to comp@@ ose the result of the work , the source code must be compiled . all building tools are group@@ ed into the program of create comp@@ iling , creating converting and creation of view .
for comp@@ iling the source text for viewing such as &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the more conversion can be converted via Alt ; 2 , the DVI ; file can be converted to a PS file and can be converted into a PS file and can be viewed by Alt ; 5 the PS file can be viewed .

the largest part of the output of &amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is taken cap@@ tive and either in the index ... dialogue or in &amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; output window are shown . the following excep@@ tions apply from this rule :
the various tools are available via the deb@@ ug@@ ging menu , whereby the project tools are the most important .
by pressing a stri@@ de @-@ white evaluation in the menu , a dialog for selecting the run speed display will be displayed .
to stop the exp@@ iry , press the W key , or select a step guide in the menu .
to announce a system ID in the current &amp; XML ; select System ID ... in the menu and enter the displayed value displayed in the displayed dialog .
to punch a Pub@@ lic@@ ID , select Pub@@ lic@@ ID ... from the menu and specify the value in the displayed dialog .
if the inspec@@ tions do not appear , select Deb@@ ug@@ ging In@@ sp@@ y ... from the menu . to edit the sources , click the source code source texts in the scanning .
all &amp; X@@ SL@@ T ; source files , which are mounted by the &amp; X@@ SL@@ T , or their si@@ bl@@ ings are listed here .
clicking on the source in the shown list came to the Tex@@ tz@@ ei@@ ger in the main window at the beginning of the appropriate file .
if the inspec@@ tions do not appear , select Deb@@ ug@@ ging In@@ sp@@ y ... from the menu . to edit the sources , click the source code source texts in the scanning .
all the found templates are listed here . it is considered that the export rules of &amp; X@@ SL@@ T shall apply . therefore , multiple templates are available with the same instruments and mode details .
clicking on the listing in the shown list moves the Tex@@ tz@@ ei@@ ger in the main window to the corresponding line of this file .
local and global variable will be shown on a map map in Dialog X@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g Inspec@@ tor . the following example shows X@@ SL@@ T source code , in which a global and local variable is declared
by pressing a variable from the list you get a summar@@ izing information in the dialog below . if a variable has a specific expression , for example
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contains a new X@@ Path with input a new value for the variable expression and pressing the button . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when pressing a variation in the list , the text files in the main window is set to the appropriate line of this file .
the version 3.2 of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; contains many new &amp; XML ; tools and features . these tools are unique in their integration in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; all these tools use com@@ edy and lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt . the combination is fast , efficient , complete and productive tools .
everybody who worked with the &amp; K@@ DE ; documentation has supposed to be a piece of thought , we give it a graphic surface ! no more on a terminal block , simply click on a terminal , simply clicked the icon to the XML processor and ready !
this application expects inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ .@@ doc@@ s in the folder . if inde@@ x@@ .@@ do@@ book is located in the ge@@ ve@@ able working folder , then leave the current working folder . if not , remove the selection of current working folder and specify it in the field of other folders by the desired folder .
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML ; files will be deleted every time when supp@@ pro@@ c started .
as already mentioned , everyone who worked on the &amp; K@@ DE ; documentation already worked , knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; there is now a great graphic surface for it .
if the just open file d@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book , then you can simply select the current working folder . if not , then choose the current folder , and enter the folder where inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book is available .
if it comes to a issue on screen , your file is faul@@ ty . please check the reported error and try it again .
if the file test is already selected in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; then you can easily remove the current file . if not , delete them with current file the tick and select the file using other file - file selection .
if you only want to know whether the well @-@ known file , then click the Well @-@ to @-@ read review selection .
for use of a &amp; D@@ TD , which is specified in &amp; XML , otherwise &amp; D@@ TD ; ( Internal ) ( default ) , otherwise &amp; D@@ TD ; ( Internal ) and XML ; sch@@ ema as well as for the Rel@@ ax@@ NG verification is necessary for speci@@ fying the defin@@ itions UR@@ I ; in the file selection .
Ja@@ ime , &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; also has a &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this is using the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 library .
if the file &apos;s ready file can be selected in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; then you can simply select the current file . if not , remove the selection current file and select the file to be processed using the other file selection .
specify the name of the file , as it is named , the file is normally stored in its home folder .
plug @-@ ins , the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; perhaps , have to do with &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; even possibly little to do . therefore , the plug @-@ in system is very powerful . you can &apos;t wait until someone use the bund@@ ling in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the plug @-@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI . more also find them below .
to install a plug@@ in or a K@@ Part , we start working with the menu plug@@ in . this will open the following dialog :
this dialog makes it possible to add all the plug@@ ins to manage and add new attach@@ ments . we describe each &amp; GUI ; -@@ ELE@@ MENT :
here you can enter the search path . for adding plug@@ ins without a storage location &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this path to searching for plug@@ ins .
often working on a project several people work in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; supports the indication of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project Properties dialog .
the name and email are self @-@ explan@@ atory . Nic@@ kn@@ ame is the case name of the user and serves for unique identification .
one member can have several roles in the project , such as team leader as well as Sub@@ project leader .
the user can look out from the list of Team Members which he is . this is done by taking the te@@ amm@@ ates from the list and the s@@ me@@ ar button as ex@@ presses . the currently selected member ( its identification ) appears , after which you are : text .
top names and adjustment of your own identity are important regarding messages and ann@@ ot@@ ations . see for further information .
besides the overview of her team , there is another advantage through the recording of the members of the team : it can be prepared for information to the team leader when a specific information is done . see in for further information .
event actions are actions which will be executed if something specific in the project . for example , the recording of public and closure of the project , if a file is secured , or the sending of a message if a file is backed up if a file is backed up into CV@@ S as soon as they added to the Project &amp; etc ;
on the page event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 project project settings dialog . events can be prepared , processed and deleted .
an email is sent to the address selected in the receiver list . the address may be a team or sub @-@ project lad@@ der . see in , we@@ i such conductors can be set up .
notes are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
remarks is simple . it may choose either the note record from the editor menu menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation key@@ word in a comment range followed by an@@ od@@ ds text .
notes may be sent a specific member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nickn@@ ame ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( Role ) is a role in the project consisting of the following possibilities : team Leader Sub@@ project leaders , according to the en@@ rich and sub @-@ project leaders , should be given the corresponding en@@ sic or sub@@ project name , as in the following examples below .
top names and roles names are independent of large or small defects , but spaces del@@ im@@ ited around the par@@ enth@@ eses and the : make the comment inv@@ alid .
&amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a development environment for script and form@@ att@@ ing languages , the D@@ TD @-@ ag@@ nost@@ ic and web @-@ based form@@ ati@@ fication and script languages supported .
settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here , only about &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found in .
the settings can be set up with the settings of Qu@@ anta . the following settings can be accessed via a few pages which will be treated with each other .
the behaviour of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; regarding tags , including car completion can be changed thus . the entries are :
large / Klein@@ abl@@ ation of tags : large / small li@@ ger@@ ation of automatically added tags . normal @-@ size , small @-@ scale means , the tags will be inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
large / Klein@@ abl@@ ation of At@@ tri@@ bu@@ cks : large / small adjustment of automatically added breathing , the attributes are inserted as inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
optional tags : if attached , is optionally available for tags , for which the closing tag is optional , this immediately after &amp; gt ; inserted .
not optional tags : as above , for all other tags , except for easy tags .
start and end @-@ day automatically update : if enabled , the respective closing day can be changed and vice vers@@ a .
automatic setting of acc@@ ent sign : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ entu@@ ated characters in the appropriate coding while keeping .
M@@ ime types : Mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es to identify different types of files . using button standard , the standard templates can be restored .
standard signature : the coding of newly created or in other way as with file open @-@ open files ( where the encoding of the file can be negoti@@ ated ) , but this setting can be stretched out by the same in the project properties , if a project is loaded .
standard @-@ D@@ TD : the selected D@@ TD is used for newly created files , or for files whose D@@ TD is not detected , however , this setting turns out by the same in the project properties , if a project is loaded .
create a backup copy : &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; created regularly backup copies , so that in a power failure or crash occurred in the next start of the program . this is not the same as saving the file . also for any stored documents , a backup is regularly produced , according to the set time .
the preview and documentation may be displayed in the editorial area or its own view ( or the documentation in a map ) which makes it possible to preview the documentation and the source code at the same time .
set the window Settings back to the next start is useful when the user interface is due to changing the MDI @-@ modes and and@@ o@@ ing / depending on each other . it complies with the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameters .
the warning messages range serves to the taxes of the possibility to dis@@ able the display of war@@ nings by An@@ ha@@ king of no more .
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; to change the display of symbols instead of scripts , as well as the synchron@@ isation behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source @-@ view in divided mode . see the different modes .
here , the par@@ ser and the structural tree that represents the illustration of the Par@@ ser @-@ no@@ des in the document , will be submitted to details .
in the mouse click on the structural tree , the following action is possible to change the action from clicking on the structural surface using the mouse buttons .
in the field of structural tree @-@ settings , the visibility of no@@ des can be opened automatically when editing and how deep when changing the structural tree can be opened automatically . empty no@@ des are exposed to the empty areas in the text , while empty groups are found no element in which the current document was found .
the area for determination of ab@@ brevi@@ ations ( a kind of templates ) which can be un@@ folded in the edit text . ab@@ brevi@@ ations are divided into groups , each can be valid for several &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; it can be a valid group for PHP in which the if@@ È@@ ab@@ brevi@@ ation is something different than in a group for Javascript .
plug@@ ins can be managed by plug@@ ins . plug@@ ins are used by the third side , which can be used by each K@@ Part @-@ capable application , most well @-@ known &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ tion of a plug @-@ ins must be specified :
address : the Path to the plug@@ in if there is not at a standard place like $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / li@@ b .
input : this information is presented to the plug@@ in at the start , so it can open the current file , related files ( path of current file ) or project folders .
component in &quot; Only @-@ L@@ ese &quot; mode download : check if the plug @-@ in is refused to load . only @-@ le@@ ese @-@ products must not exceed the load when this option is not selected .
check the plug@@ in : is this activated , then test@@ is &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; if the requested information is correct . if the plug@@ in is not available if the plug@@ in at the moment is not available , but it should be installed later .
for the quantitative assessment of version 3.3 , the troub@@ les@@ hooting are completely redesigned . Die@@ ug@@ ger was discontinued , as well as the support for the D@@ BG Deb@@ ug@@ ger . instead , a deb@@ ug@@ ger plug@@ in concept has been implemented , which enables various implem@@ entations about plug@@ ins .
currently only a plug @-@ in is available , the support for the use of &amp; g@@ ub@@ ed ; in@@ quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ;
the use of the deb@@ ug@@ ger for a project starts with the selection of a matching deb@@ ug@@ ger plug@@ ins in the project settings . using the check@@ box in addition to the deb@@ ug@@ ger @-@ in selection field , specific settings can be changed .
if a project is enabled to de@@ bug , some additional elements will appear in the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; interface :
view to the content of monitored variables is shown . usually in the left dock .
a view of all stops , with line numbers and terms are listed . appears normally in the lower Dock .
a view to view the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the deb@@ ug@@ gers . usually appears in the lower Dock .
depending on the supported features of the deb@@ ug@@ gers all or part of the following functionality is available .
with this promotion , the connection to the deb@@ ug@@ ger , if necessary , or it spl@@ its to listen to de@@ bug requirements , if a project is opened if a project is opened , which must not be considered normal .
the counter@@ part to de@@ bug session Star@@ te the session . includes the connection to deb@@ ug@@ ger or termin@@ ates the me@@ ar according to the requirements .
sends a HTTP request to the server to initi@@ ate a de@@ bug requirement . this is equivalent to the use of a browser to watch the current document . the issue of this requirement is displayed in the view of deb@@ ug@@ ger issue .
has the deb@@ ug@@ ger to begin with the implementation of the script and information on the monitored variables as well as the current printed line will be continued while the script will continue , before a deb@@ ug@@ requirement is started , the script will start with the request .
indicates the deb@@ ug@@ ger to begin with the execution of the script , without inform@@ ing variables and the current line number . if this is done , the version runs through a script , starts the execution as soon as a request is made .
the deb@@ ug@@ ger causes the next statement in script , without going to include the functions or include files .
the deb@@ ug@@ ger brings the next statement in script , whereby if possible in functions and include effects .
with Deb@@ ug@@ ger , the deb@@ ug@@ ger to go over and go to the next way as there wouldn &apos;t be the current .
open a dialog in which a variable or expression can be entered , which should be monitored . the monitored value appears in the Vari@@ ab@@ len@@ View picture .
this dialog box can be entered into a variable or set a new value of a variable .
&amp; Drink ; is a work by K@@ eit@@ h Is@@ dale as well as this part of documentation . &amp; k@@ x@@ mas ; is a &amp; K@@ DE ; front @-@ end and a K@@ Part of x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g you can find at h@@ tt@@ p : / / x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g@@ .@@ s@@ f@@ .net with many other works of K@@ eit@@ h can be found .
this chapter describes how to custom@@ ize &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you can adapt to your needs and how you can help &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; help to be better .
documentation of editing packages ( D@@ T@@ EP ; s ) are used in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; provide support for Mark@@ up@@ - and scripts . its simplicity and flexibility makes it &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web@@ developer , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; s are available in two ways , family 1 , Mark@@ up Language and Family 2 , the script files or the tool bar . day file contain two dates , the tag folders and the tool bar . tag folders ( above the editing window ) , text and instructions are added to a document , as a user may ever .
&amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing D@@ TD . see in details for converting .
this document describes how the XML files are to create , then the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool bar . short , one &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags and the content of the at@@ u@@ res@@ dial@@ og@@ es , the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the day shows the rules and information of &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; even . tool aff@@ ord permit a fast inser@@ tion of tags in a document without a writing tool .
tag folders are not a folder . they contain only the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folders can carry the name of the open language and version , so available . ( for example , html @-@ 4.0@@ 1 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of the day XML , or not clear whether they are necessary , or not all necessary , it is advis@@ able to use as many as possible , so many users have a better insight and more information in working with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limits will be displayed in simple way .
this is the root element of an Tag@@ XML document . it can only contain once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags but does not contain any element itself above itself .
the type of tags is a script . when using it &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the day type class . the name of the basis class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only valid only for the Type Method . gives the name of the class to where this method is part . ( only family 2 )
if yes , the day has a common At@@ tri@@ butes and attributes within this tags can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 )
put text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; -@@ Day . that &apos;s a element of element element .
describes a attri@@ bute a tags . this element can only indicate once a attri@@ bute . it puts the name and type of attri@@ bute . in addition , there are further tags that describe how this attri@@ bute should be displayed &amp; etc ; This is a mere element element .
specifies the source code for the attributes of the day editorial dialog and the attri@@ bute tree .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is used to achieve the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of one interface . the d@@ co@@ p methodology within &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is used to achieve the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , an interface and methodology . the arguments that can be passed to the method . may be empty or % tag@@ name % , that means the name of the current tags .
a container tag that collec@@ ts the elements of a list which can be group@@ ed together . it can only occurs for an attri@@ bute description . it is a only element type element .
puts the position of a tags within a dialog box . this day can occur only once in a dialogue ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; -@@ day ) . the element is empty .
there is the position and size of a field in dialogue . this day should be available for each field in a dialogue ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this element is empty .
there is a list of elements that may occur within the specified tags . this element is an element one element .
there is a list of elements that end a day . this element is an element one element .
all Tag@@ XML files must begin with an &amp; XML ; Declaration begin : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly adjusted and closed .
spaces do nothing influence , but pay attention to &amp; &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; Tool@@ box &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; replaces no leg break , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to check the Tag@@ XML files the tools dialog above is in the top &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ window to start and review Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . a further dialog will appear to follow the simple instructions .
this function is currently not available . currently , the verification takes only when charging the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; .
in the following an example for a family of 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; sch@@ ema &gt; ELE@@ MENT from the &amp; W@@ 3C ; &amp; XML ; sch@@ ema . the fil@@ en@@ ame is intended for this day XML file .
in the following an example for a working family 2 daily XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP ; request @-@ function is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this Tag@@ XML file is intended to be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UTF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt;
the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just fairly simple and there is a editor accessible via D@@ TD edit D@@ TD settings . therefore , di@@ ed@@ es@@ cu@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; a simple &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; should be created with the following entries :
&#91; General &#93; version = add 1 for &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for any higher version . name = D@@ TD / / / D@@ TD HTML 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional = The simplified name of the D@@ TD . ( HTML 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nickn@@ ame .
a action can set with settings of actions ... to be created . Click on New promotion to the same dialog :
this action is assigned short@@ cut . with pressing the user button you can select a short@@ cut table ; with K@@ one is removed the current short@@ cut .
the sim@@ pl@@ est actions . it can be entered into detailed settings and inserted in the execution of the promotion , this text is inserted in the document on the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , you can change or use the document ( or parts of the document ) . examples from &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; themselves are the quick start dialog or the various See in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ T@@ EP@@ s .
the first must be given the name of the script and the interpre@@ ter . example : SH / home / my@@ Scri@@ pt@@ .@@ sh .
although qualified paths are permitted , it is recommended to use the % scri@@ pt@@ .@@ sh@@ .@@ in command line : $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ Path There are other special variable , which can be used in command line :
% f : we replaced the URL of the current document . in case of a local document , file : / from the document name .
% p@@ id : is replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; process will be replaced by &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; only one instance will be installed if D@@ COP is used to control &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the external script will be used by the external script .
parameters for this event , usually the fil@@ en@@ ame of the current document or the path to the repository .
in addition to the above mentioned methods , a script can accept one script of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in the selection dialog box can be determined to send what is to the default value . possibilities are :
selected text : the selected area of the document is transmitted to the script . the % input variable is normally useful only with this setting .
according to the input , the output of the conducted application can also be re@@ directed . there are two types of issue , to which standard edition is written ; error messages can be done with the text written in the text by clicking the value of the select output :
if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to create the tags in logical groups . it is necessary to create a tool@@ bar for each group . in any case it is not too many , therefore you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the market .
once a tool@@ bar is added , you must add and configure actions . choose settings .
the parts of this window are pretty self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the new action button at the bottom end of the window starts the editing mode .
fill out all the necessary fields and add the day to the suitable tool bar .
complete all , if the day has attributes and plan your use , activate &quot; tag &quot; day &quot; when available , so that an input when using the action is possible .
Ig@@ itt ! is it a real symbol . who should remember the action in conjunction with this icon ? we replace it before we have trouble .
for creating a symbol no symbol that the action will be better , we will use &amp; k@@ ic@@ one@@ dit ; select other programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) .
&amp; k@@ ic@@ one@@ dit ; used by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size .
please note that the created symbol does not only help you to realize what the action does , but also all other users of the &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; .
with regard to the day &apos;s start , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is mostly interpreted , rigid , further interpreted ) , or should , at least , a message to the user will be given that clicking on this symbol will be entered ; -@@ day in the current document .
after creating the symbol no longer must be connected to the action . this happens through the menu with Settings ... ( in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; ) and selecting the desired action . in addition to the text box there is a button , press him .
select the folder where the stored symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the user button and continue with other tags , so it gives , or confirm with OK to complete .
supp@@ ose you want to add some usual &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; functions for tool bar , or should set this to better overview through several separ@@ ators in multiple groups . open the tool bar dialog over Settings tool bar . make sure that the desired tool@@ bar is selected .
I want to select the separ@@ ators ( top left ) for my tool bar . after selecting the element that should be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow button to the right . this adds the element to the tool@@ bar .
for example , I want to preview a fast way to access the con@@ quer@@ or . I will select it and add to the tool bar .
please note , as the separ@@ ators support group . someone who doesn &apos;t know my tool bar couldn &apos;t believe that the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ button is the contrary to the start button .
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by pressing all symbols to ensure that everything works .
secure your desired folder . after Reb@@ e@@ XML does not exist , it will be saved in the right folder , but your tool bar ( s ) should be loaded in the right folder . please adjust their tool bar ( s ) if a file is opened by the appropriate type .
perhaps the chose extension of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the script language or the form@@ att@@ ing language which you like to do this chapter , as I describes a &amp; PHP ; documentation @-@ tree for my personal use .
before you start your own documentation , you could see the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ itory if someone has done this already for you .
there are two parts in this process . first , you need to search an exist@@ ent documentation for the form@@ att@@ ainment / scripts / etc ; then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . the first part we will handle you to the second treat us here .
# K@@ DE Configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c You = path , relative to this file , e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # 1 , tag@@ 1 , tag@@ 1 , tag@@ 1 , tag@@ 1 , tag@@ 1 = shield 1.@@ html pages 2 = viewed 2.@@ html tag@@ 1 = tag@@ 1.@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html pages 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html
the tree component defines the visible part of documentation in the document of documentation . for example , check out the &amp; PHP ; documentation is something :
# K@@ DE config File &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c You = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element Top element = PHP 4.2 Docum@@ entation = Table of Cont@@ ents = Introduction = Refle@@ x@@ .@@ html ... Language Reference = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = Price synchron@@ ously .@@ html ...
note that # before Get@@ ting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . that shows that it is about sub @-@ folders in the tree with its own content . there is no known border for the chess testing ( except by reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
note that the table of contents directly refers to a file ( and consistent on the upper end of the module &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; file is displayed ! ) .
spaces do nothing influence , but pay attention to &amp; &amp; lt ; sign . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; res@@ our@@ c@@ end@@ at@@ eries are replaced .
the content section is the range of do@@ cr@@ c file , which is to be displayed on the design of the con@@ tex@@ tual help . for example , if writing a &amp; PHP ; text for context @-@ use would be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Con@@ text List ) and file attach@@ ments .
a simple list of separated context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; these are the functions of PHP &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can save your file do@@ cr@@ c if you want to save your file to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc / Qu@@ anta / doc / Qu@@ anta / doc / Qu@@ anta / doc / Qu@@ anta / doc / Qu@@ anta / doc / Qu@@ anta / doc / Qu@@ anta / doc / Qu@@ anta / doc / Qu@@ anta / doc / Qu@@ anta / doc / Qu@@ anta / doc / Qu@@ anta / doc ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation there .
if you are sure that these good and it &apos;s worth going to be dealt , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation were used to be done by the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ community . they are not rich , but are proud to have worked with the best web development platform .
with &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the her@@ ni@@ ated resources ( D@@ T@@ EP packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can send an email to friends , partners or else who will send in different places , such as D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ T@@ EP ) with email , tool bar buttons with email , in context menu of files and folders in the context menu and in scripts .
the resources can be uploaded to our main archive , where all the other &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ users can be reviewed and only available when our team is considered correct and useful for the publication . to ensure a useful contribution , the source of resources is guaranteed , both for our team as well as for later users .
when up@@ loading you are asked for their private G@@ PG keys ( the Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the case that you can find out multiple keys , you can keep one out . in the dialogue New resource , you can stay empty , and with clicking OK the up@@ loading can be started .
up@@ loading can also instantly upload the menus D@@ TD D@@ TD ( D@@ T@@ EP ) , tool bar tool bar , and in context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts .
after downloading a resource , nor before installation , investigated &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the in@@ tox@@ icity of the resource through examination of integrity and Sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ence . in case of problems and the resource is carefully signed , a message appears with the indication of the origin@@ ator of the resource .
it is possible to work in XML languages , which is currently not yet supported by &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; however , it can work tim@@ ely , because hundreds of tag files can be needed in tag@@ XML format . it provides the simpler way to automatically convert D@@ TD to a D@@ T@@ EP package .
the conversion can be started from the menu D@@ TD charging and convert a D@@ TD . select the .@@ dt@@ d file with the D@@ TD description which should be used . afterwards , the following dialog appears :
objective : the newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! doc@@ type defin@@ itions : the string that appear in ! doc@@ type tag , such as HTML PU@@ BL@@ IC - / / W@@ 3C / / D@@ TD HTML 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional / / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e.@@ dt@@ d
fine adjustment of the D@@ T@@ EP after conversion : if enabled , brings &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; after conversion the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; Editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; it is recommended to use this possibility .
in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; there are some key concepts . to understand this and full use of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this chapter tries to talk about these fundamental concepts , without their understanding &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; little benefits to it .
in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the work area is divided into three areas : global , locally and projection . this distinction concerns a range of components in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ;
global elements are available for each , the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; uses , available . by tool aff@@ ord of promotions , everything is selected as global , in the common stock structure of various tool aff@@ ord , actions and patterns will be able to secure actions and patterns in a global tree that will then be available at any user @-@ user environment .
local elements represent a personal collection of web development aid for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tools . local elements are stored in the user directory , so that they can only use this user personally .
project related elements are only available within a certain project . it can be specially designed for the files of a specific project . simply said that this is most limited size . all elements are stored in the folder &apos;s tree @-@ tree structure and designs of all employees within the project .
the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ MDI ; consists of some major areas : the editorial window , the architectural inten@@ tions , the cart@@ ography with information and the tool bar . please beat in , and for further information about these localities .
you can click the cart@@ ei@@ re@@ mark with the right mouse button to obtain a context menu with the current document , such as close the current , other or of the cardboard , jump to a book@@ mark or execution of CV@@ S commands to the current document .
right click in the editorial area lead to a further context menu regarding the processed document , such as basic processing steps ( cut / copy / insert ) , processing of the file under the mouse , or open the file , when the string is called a file under the mouse .
at the top end of the editorial window , the makers of the Ed@@ itors are currently foc@@ us@@ sing ; &amp; HTML ; 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional master@@ piece , for which a set of tool bars will be shown . in the course of further expansion of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the tool aff@@ ord are adapted to the new functions and related user needs .
the use of tool bars is really easy . if they want to insert a simple day , e.g. &amp; lt ; then you can insert the data for this straight day . now you can insert the data for this straight day . if you wish to insert multiple attributes ( like anch@@ ors ) , you can fill in a dialogue with different fields .
the installation views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow it to open and strip them in the information to &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for files , project , sample templates , docum@@ ent@@ aries , scripts , attributes and documentary architectural prospects .
project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; provided this view shows all files in the project using the right mouse click . actions such as adding , remove , upload or delete the files from storage medium can be carried out using the context menu .
another option of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the use of templates . almost anything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc . there are all options open .
templates can be divided in three categories , depending on which connection it depends on . global templates are still available , local templates only for the respective users and templates in projects are only available in the project . more to templates are available .
here you find information on the available script . the concept of integration in Global , Lok@@ al and Project also works here . by clicking with the left mouse button there are further functions available , such as the script will be able to edit or send it with an email .
with this view , the internal structure of the active document is set . by left @-@ clicking of an element , the cur@@ sor is set to the position of the element . by right @-@ clicking of a Elem@@ entary , a list of commands opens in terms of navigation and collection of the tree .
this tree appears among the other construc@@ ts . with him , man@@ ag@@ erial attributes and name rooms can change the protection of all available attributes with few clicks .
here is the complete documentation for web technology for your development . it can be downloaded documentation for &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from the quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &apos; document site can be downloaded , and by adding a folder &apos;s doc to create project @-@ specific documentation , edited and viewed .
by default , &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; two Cart@@ ridge at the bottom end of the window can be reached via the useful information : the message window and the problem window .
this map shows information about every in Qu@@ anta met@@ a script . for example , e.g. the D@@ TD being used for the current document and all changes to D@@ TD .
this cardboard box shows all the error in the mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; scripts that are executed , give all error messages ( such as what are ) in this window .
the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; Tool@@ bars are extensive , and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and it will receive the corresponding command . the chocolate bars of the tool bar is the possibility to define their own commands as symbols in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ;
another feature of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with email . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; sends the tool@@ bar as a compressed T@@ ar @-@ Archive via &amp; @-@ mail ; if you get a tool@@ bar in an email , you can secure them in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; like any other backup and load !
it is reasonable if you want to custom@@ ize the place of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; files can be adapted to your system . to get a complete list of options , enter . / configure --@@ help . the options are simple to understand and not done here .
if you have problems when starting &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you should check whether your path contains the &amp; K@@ DE ; 3 bin folders . also , you should make sure that no older version of &amp; K@@ DE ; 3 in the Path before her bin folders . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t .
quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; was optimized for rapid web development and combines a well @-@ mature development environment with a wide range of powerful functions .
during the effort to create the best &amp; HTML editor ; the developers of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us began to deal with an obvious idea : what would be if &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; an independent , ext@@ endable mark@@ up languages would be ? well , this would make him an absolutely large web development tool for &amp; K@@ DE ; so it was done .
no longer on pure &amp; HTML ; is limited &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive Web development tool . together , you should define it &amp; XML ; then it should be &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the appropriate &amp; IDE ;
well , to which the above claim must be noted that &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; as product is based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; K@@ DE ; it is not only possible to expand users and developers , &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; so it allows users to expand as they need for their need .
&amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; allows web development support the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( MDI ; ) . this can boost productivity for almost any task . by means of self @-@ coated actions , it can be expanded &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; however , no script can notice any scripts . ( more about them find them in . )
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for fast web development and quickly developed into a mature editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is in any way with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the G@@ PL @-@ licensed version and produced a commercial program .
for more detailed documentation is help to help you : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or help@@ full help ) .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and supervised by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Sequ@@ org @ k@@ de.@@ org and Andr@@ as Man@@ ti@@ a am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de.@@ org .
a fast @-@ access list of files that you have opened . this list changes every time , if you open a file , which is not on it , the oldest entry is taken out .
this allows you to save code parts and entire files as templates for later use . check in the section regarding templates . should they try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project manager , only an error is reported .
converts the special characters to the clip@@ board where contains special characters for &amp; HTML ; -@@ shots , so it is correct and not to agree with the browser as form@@ att@@ ing instruction .
converts the text from the clip@@ board in &amp; URL , which the correct way to insert special characters and spaces . s is primarily used to insert &amp; URL ; s into the anchor Day .
automatically switches block selection to or from . it allows you to select text blocks with the help of the &amp; Shift .
go directly to a line number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; script error messages !
search a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a type of gre@@ p or SE@@ D with GUI and pre@@ defined expres@@ sions to help you .
displays the message window or not . that &apos;s the window where you can see the display of scripts and deb@@ ug@@ ger .
drawing and switching of the problem @-@ on at the bottom edge of the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main window . the problem is activated once you move to the structural tree .
shows the symbol left from the main window . this column allows you to make book@@ mark with a mouse click .
when there is book@@ marks in the current file , it will appear in the menu together with entries submitted or Next , depending on the position of the cur@@ sor in the document .
book@@ marks from other un@@ locked documents appear in the menu , according to the fil@@ en@@ ame of other documents .
a non @-@ exist@@ ent project from hard drive . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; projects are stored with the file extension .@@ web@@ cam@@ j .
to insert a dialogue to insert files into the current project . the selected files are then copied to the project directory .
sear@@ ches the project directory for new files that could be there . such can copy graphics files into your project folders or a sub @-@ folder and add them to the project .
load the files in your project on the server . the list of available transportation methods depends on your Version &amp; K@@ DE ; and whether you have downloaded more inputs / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
settings like &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the project manages . in chapter &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ projects please find details .
load a project certificate . these will be stored in project you / tool@@ bars and are only available in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to save your tool bar . allows you to select the type of tool bar : locally or project .
opens a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this creates only the name . promotions must be saved by means of tool bar buttons or you will be asked if you want to save the tool bar .
remov@@ es a tool@@ bar from the visual field . if you haven &apos;t en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed from the hard disk . if you have not saved the tool bar , you will be asked if you want to do it .
thus you can send their own tool bar at someone ( perhaps at the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; team , that the tool bar is available in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the tool@@ bar as app@@ endix .
enables the up@@ loading of tool aff@@ ord to the main server , where any other can access it . see in .
charging &amp; D@@ TD , which you have or some someone else has and convert them to the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; own definition format .
load / respon@@ sive to re@@ alities from the &amp; D@@ TD ; this is useful if the Ent@@ ities are to be renewed , without the whole &amp; D@@ EP ; if this is globally and a write permission in the global K@@ DE folder is not included , f@@ ails to shop .
this menu contains a list of tags that are loaded in the currently loaded tool bar . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool bar is loaded , there are in the tags menu , which contains the list of tags / actions in this tool@@ bar .
allows access to the current day settings dialog if there is one . this entry is available in the menu Tags , followed by &amp; D@@ TD ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus .
activ@@ ates or de@@ activated the intelligent inser@@ tion of tags . currently , this works only with ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ T@@ Ds . smart insert means that &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the inser@@ tion of tool bar must be refused , if this day contra@@ dic@@ ts the rules .
in the plug@@ ins menu , the available plug listed below the menu commands are listed . clicking on clicking on the plug @-@ in plug@@ in .
elec@@ ts the syn@@ dic@@ ation control mode for the current file . the list of available down@@ turn schem@@ ata depends on the release ; -@@ version from .
select the type of line identification . very useful if you know people who use other OS platforms to develop . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
check the syntax of the current document using selected &amp; D@@ TD ; using external use T@@ id@@ y .
Instant switching between different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , the switch@@ over sometimes need time or un@@ beautiful graphics . recommended is the box mode , or the window mode , which is the default in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu contains an entry for each open @-@ window . with a selection of one entry , the corresponding sub @-@ window is activated .
switches the status bar at the bottom edge of the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main window on or off .
the changes in this dialogue can be used to use the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ web browsers .
find details of the editors . you can find details in the documentation of &amp; Kate ; Click here for details .
a dialog appears where you delete entries from the tool@@ bars , or add which you can follow the sequences .
that should generate a help according to the environment of the mouse , but is not yet implemented .
&amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a high @-@ quality product that is freely available and freely available , but as with any open source project , developers can always use help . if they want support the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ development in financial form you will find here the way .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be completed at the top of the project called the whole directory structure for the rest of the project . all these paths and author information fields can be completed later with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties .
here is the name to enter the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name , file is completed automatically .
this is the name of the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; project file . by default , it has the name of the project in lower@@ case and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can access the machine address of the machine , which one wants to access the one , besides one processed local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exempl@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.0.0@@ .1 ) are possible .
if one makes this field empty , the default settings are used . depending on the remote computer , the remote computer could be necessary .
this is the folder where the templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to project and standard templates . if a common collection of files used for various projects should be set instead of the standards .
this is the folder where the tool bar can be stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and standard tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files used for various projects should be set instead of the standards .
that allows to insert files from local file system into the project . several files or entire folders can be selected .
this setting is great when you have a static web content that you want to download and change . in ser@@ ver@@ ing scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) .
if , if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project , we are to be mounted . if a project is due to new , not an@@ ha@@ ze .
with this option all files and folders are displayed within the main character and you can present a precise selection of good man@@ tle .
this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can choose the desired files by chance or , by removing the skins , cl@@ amps from the project .
the last screen of the new project assist@@ ants includes three settings to simpli@@ fy your work . these settings can also instantly upload these settings in the menu of the menu in the sub@@ window profiles , or with the Shift short@@ cut Shift . F@@ 7 .
some settings are identical to those in the project assist@@ ants and are described in detail . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( plac@@ eholder possible ) , which can be re @-@ related to project related operations like project folder .
additional option to top , also files that are listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ or , are excluded from the project .
the projection view , which will be uploaded during opening of the project . can be read more about projec@@ tions .
the desired deb@@ ug@@ ger can be selected . currently , G@@ ub@@ ed is currently supported . more information on G@@ ub@@ ed can be set in . the deb@@ ug@@ ger plug@@ in can be set with the options . in this case , the troub@@ les@@ hooting are described .
in the sub@@ window profiles , up@@ loading profiles ( see in ) can be set , as well as the display of a base for the content of the server for each profile by showing a separate module for each profile .
in the sub @-@ window team configuration , project members can be added , processed or deleted as well as a ma@@ iling list . see details in details .
in the bottom window event configuration , one can place event actions and add this promotions to change or delete this promotions , if there is a previously specific event , such as the backing of a file . see in details .
standard opens &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the last project that was opened . this behavior can not be influenced .
to open a different project , select Project ... from the menu Project or the Symbol Project open from the tool@@ bar . the Project Project will be opened and allows selecting a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
if &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; closed , the project file will be stored automatically . you are asked if you want to save changes before leaving , if &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; changed files . the same happens when you invite a new project .
the project management provides free access to the files in the project . you can manage the files in the current project .
file respon@@ ds equally , however , the entries must be opened and open with ... in the right button of the mouse on the right mouse button :
here different profiles can be selected . the profile contains information about the site of highly secure files . see .
enables the removing of current profile . if only more a profile is present , the button will cut off to prevent removing the removal .
the password is kept in the core memory and remember program . these possibility is useful if common up@@ loading of files needed and the rather un@@ safe password on the record is not listed in question .
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before up@@ loading .
in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; many high @-@ la@@ vers profiles can be uploaded and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to various servers . when editing or creating an profile this dialog will be displayed :
that &apos;s the client &apos;s name to be copied to files . either a fully qualified domain name or IP address work .
the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; K@@ DE ; and the installed K@@ io slaves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and NFS .
the port for the transfer . usually , this must not be changed , except the network administrator managed to operate a service on the usual port .
depending on your Ang@@ st@@ shaft this is either a time @-@ saving function or a risk . if your password will be saved on the plate , so that it can &apos;t be easily read , but everyone can see with programming language .
a projection view is only one set of files and tool bars . it can be used in a project many views , i.e. through a simple diving of the view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool bar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; views can be saved in the menu &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Project or Project Tool Bar , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can be accessed , open or deleted by the tool bar tool@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tool@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; with which one has to do most . this helps not only increase productivity , but also allow the adaptation of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in own working methods .
as already mentioned above , machine ben@@ ds in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; best can be stacked on the tool@@ bar . using and adding tool bar , the tool will be treated below to add tool bars below .
the tool bar and symbols can be set either by context menu ( right click on the tool@@ bar ) , in which the new tool@@ bar can be removed , tool bar ren@@ aming or tool bar can be adjusted in the dialog , where can be specified in the dialog , which can be visible on this or other tool@@ bars .
by calling the context menu on a tool@@ bar ( symbol ) on a tool@@ bar , additionally the entries will be removed and action displayed , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tool bar and the actions can set up in the menu with settings and set up the settings ..
templates are in the essential document cass@@ ette , code @-@ Schnitz@@ el and files to link . you can copy , move or any system available on the system existing in the previous system . templates have in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in about restrictions you imagine to file system .
some with &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified at the beginning of any template before use .
binary is all that is not pure text . it can normally be any file except text , so pictures , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc . binary templates are normally inserted in documents through short@@ cuts ( e.g. pictures with IM@@ G sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . further information on templates are available .
documents can be created by any text document . on the basis of this templates , new documents can be created . normally , a simple rum@@ or can be found in appropriate way to save efficiently . some examples may be found under global templates . see also for more information on templates .
this kind of templates is useful if not a new document may be inserted based on a template but the same text area to be inserted again into the documents . you can find anything from a comment about a complete menu system on Javascript , or Perl . see also for more information on templates .
as the name suggests this templates for all websites as templates . they are a collection of different documents , which can be organized in a folder t@@ inc@@ ture at a compressed t@@ ar archives . there are currently no examples in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ;
design a document structure according to Belgian ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; ) and select the file as template . save the local template ....
as soon as this is done , note that ( even if it was stored as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . check out in the previous system of project templates .
select text in your document and click on File As template &apos;s selection as a local / project template . alternatively , the selection may be removed with drag and off on the template templates .
the creation of binary templates is simple : copy file only in a folder folder . it can be used for all file management functions , such as pulling , and insert on the file tree from Kon@@ quer@@ or .
one can click on the file tree or in the project files Building view to a folder on the right and backup to secure a name for the template and secure . by default , it can be stored as a local or global template .
project templates permit a very well @-@ oriented approach . you can create head@@ lines and foot@@ lines , or trans@@ form files or linking . in addition , some things can keep some things using templates in projects very deep breath in the eye .
the deposit structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files contained in $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates . each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers , such as above .
to define the behaviour of a folder with the right mouse button , click on the folder and choose the menu menu . the following dialog appears :
a selection box with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is b@@ lown , as soon as the attributes is distor@@ ted .
this is activated by default and fits all except the root folder . if a root folder would be set in principle , unless it would be explicitly enabled , if it would be explicitly enabled . in case of a normal folder , the bla@@ h would appear with something like text building . if nothing appears , there is probably in a tri@@ gue .
allows a set or tested text for templates in this folder . this could be general head@@ lines or foot@@ lines for all templates for a particular project and allows to equ@@ ip all templates to a folder with special head@@ lines / foot@@ lines a whole presentation already with the appropriate head@@ lines / foot@@ lines .
in addition , using context menu ( pressing the right mouse button ) on a full command collection for adding folders or copy and add templates from one place to another .
with two modes : V@@ PL ; Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; Source Editor , which can be reached via the menu View . the first mode replaces the source editor in two parts : the source editor and the V@@ PL ; Editor .
the V@@ PL ; Editor works as follows : it will load a document such as a normal &amp; HTML ; - or X@@ HTML ; -@@ page and a cur@@ sor . then you can edit and see if necessary to source code editor , in which the changes carried out in the source code can be visible in the source code .
when working with the V@@ PL ; editor in a document , the &amp; PHP ; contains a small green symbol of V@@ oh@@ and@@ ated by &amp; PHP ; source code . it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; Editor &apos;s source code . there are no plans to change these behavi@@ ours .
the second mode works exactly as the first , except for the changes both in the source editor and in the V@@ PL ; Editor is already active and the cur@@ sor in the source Editor is already active , the button transfer the active cur@@ sor from a window to another , whereby the position is retained in the document .
the synchron@@ ization distance between the V@@ PL ; Editor and the source editor can be adjusted via Settings Qu@@ anta . in addition , the recommendation can be set automatically between synchron@@ ization after one click or automatically . in the selection , the recommendation : a small range for fast computer and a large range of slow for slow motion .
supp@@ ose you want to change the title of the website , so it is possible to select the documentation of invisible tags when working with the V@@ PL ; Editor is also called , as soon as a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; Editor is designed to change the suspension of the hands . this means that you can change the following :
met@@ a @-@ Tags allow storage of information about the document themselves e.g. perc@@ us@@ sions for internet search engines . met@@ a @-@ elements can be added to the list below . one click allows changing the in@@ hal@@ tes , e.g. key keywords on the column name and key@@ word keywords on the content column .
CSS rules are the new way of design in the browser . you can add CSS rules using buttons under the list or delete . a change over the list is possible exactly as in the met@@ a @-@ elements . the editing of CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to insert an external CSS style translation by clicking on the file button and select the appropriate file .
the use of cur@@ sors is as illustrated in a text processing , thanks to the arrows , possible . under rare circumstances , the cur@@ sor works perfectly . text can be inserted as usual . text can be inserted by typ@@ ew@@ ard or deleted by return or distances .
the inser@@ tion of tags will be done in the same way via the tool@@ bars , such as in the source Editor , e.g. if an anchor @-@ day has already been removed if an anchor tag , en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed with text , each other housing must be removed each day .

there are many graphical tools for the same . why so &amp; diff@@ 3 ; ? let me briefly explain why I wrote .
the merger was very complicated because one of the contributions made many changes and simultaneously on many places the entries had been corrected . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result were numerous conflicts in bringing together .
that &apos;s the program used to me only the changed lines , but I could not see what exactly had changed within these lines . and there was no indications of the positions , where perhaps only the inclusion of these changes was a small night@@ mare .
that was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could display differences within one line and changes to white characters . later , a lot of more useful features were added later .
for example , if you want to compare fast text , copy it simply into the clip@@ board and add him in one of the comparison window .
a function which made a lot of work was the publishing and merge of folders . this feature turned &amp; diff@@ 3 ; almost into a full file browser .
also 3 @-@ way con@@ tests will be fully supported . this is useful when two persons can work independently from each other on a piece of Co@@ de and show simultaneously the dis@@ sol@@ ving result . in this editor , you can even edit the result . in this editor , you can even directly edit the result . the screenshot shows three qu@@ ell files at the coll@@ ision :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; helps you complete the same and con@@ domin@@ ate folder . this screen photo shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in the folder assembly :
&amp; low diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and is based on how to check the opportunities today &apos;s color monitors . if you often have Co@@ de , you &apos;ll like this function .
differences in white characters and tab@@ ul@@ ators are visible . if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters , you can see it at a glance at the Sum@@ mary in column at the left side . ( no nu@@ ger more , if any one changes the influence . )
if a file is equal , and the other is different in one line , then the color indicates that the file is different . red color means that both files are different .
if all files are in the same name , but in different folders , you can make the typ@@ ing work completely by using the fil@@ en@@ ames of the first file . example :
diff@@ 3 Fol@@ ner@@ 1 folder 2 folder Tit@@ le 3 Fol@@ der 1 folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 folder folder
the opening dialog makes it easy to select fil@@ en@@ ames file names , select the selection above the file @-@ browser ( file ... ) or the selection of a last opened file on the next time . you don &apos;t need to specify a third file ; if you do not leave the entry for C empty , the analysis of the differences are carried out with two files .
via the button folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the same or merge of folders will be selected , for B and C , however , select a folder , then uses &amp; diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ames consisted of A in the two other folders .
if mer@@ ging is crossed , the input field is active for the target and can process it . however , it is not necessarily necessary to set immediately an output file . you can even do this step later when saving .
the set kno@@ b opens a dialog with settings . here you can set options before using the same / merge operation .
sometimes you would like to compare text of a text , but only parts of a text . &amp; diff@@ 3 ; allows you to select text parts from the clip@@ board into the active comparison window . the opening dialog will need to select any files , you can simply connect the dialog with the shut@@ down button .
you can also use drag and finish : just drag one file from a file manager or selected text from a editor and let it fall over a comparison window .
what idea is behind it ? sometimes , a file e.g. contains several similar functions . if you want to figure out similar files , it would like to load two corresponding files , it would then compare and compare it . now , you can easily copy the relevant sections , add and then compare it .
note : currently , you can do anything from a diff@@ 3 ; only out the case of text in a comparison window is supported .
warning : some editors interpre@@ t the drag and lay text into another program as cut and insert ( instead of copying and insert ) . in such case , your original data may be lost .
in the upper part of each text window , the Info line contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ame and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( if the path comes to a file , leave the mouse a while on the line . then a small relief window will show the full name . )
the three source windows are assigned to letters A , B and C , and the colour is blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these settings can be changed over the settings menu . )
if a difference is detected , one can differ at the color , which is different files , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in settings ) . the color scheme is especially useful if you compare three files . this is clearly visible in the next section ( merge ) .
links to the text is the summar@@ ised column . if differences were found , the column shows the appropriate color . with some programming languages the white characters is not so important to see the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + e.g. , white characters is relevant only in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in few , rare cases relevant . )
the vertical line which separates the summar@@ ization column from the text , where the source file has no lines . if the line orbit is enabled , the line will be shown on broken lines .
the pane window ( below the comparison of comparison ) has also an Info line with the wording edition : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; changes &#93; if you have revised the result . usually , it contains the automatic compilation with text , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all disputes occur , the deposit is disabled ! ! ! ( use the buttons to ab@@ le@@ ak / un@@ solved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two reference windows is used , any difference at the same time has to be replaced manually .
by one click with the left mouse button in one of the windows , the group is highlighted in all windows , where the first row is highlighted in the windows , where the first group is highlighted in the windows . it is then highlighted by the color background color for current section and on the left is a black beams .
sometimes it remains in the box or by manual edit any other line more in the group ; it is displayed only in these lines . this text appears neither in the final file , nor in a mark which you may copy and somewhere else .
the text &amp; lt ; summar@@ izes ; however , in the clip@@ board , if you copy such a text from the spring window . carefully go carefully with this feature .
note : if when selecting the sources you want to ign@@ ore the options below or Ig@@ nor@@ iere C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white characters .
this will navigate mainly to the images and mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you are in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys on , right , end , string column next to the vertical frame outlet , and you can also click on navigation use .
in the eye window , you can also use the other buttons to edit . using the insert button , you can change between plug@@ ging and over@@ drive mode . ( default is the one @-@ set mode ) .
one click with the left mouse button in one of the summary columns synchron@@ izes view of all windows in the beginning of the respective group ( as already in the context and the editing output window was explained ) .
the tool bar contains seven buttons to navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ down / Str@@ g @-@ pic@@ kl@@ ed ) , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ down / C@@ tr@@ l @-@ pic@@ kl@@ ed ) or to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ down / C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture ) . therefore , all non @-@ dissolved conflicts should also be regarded as a conflict . therefore , between sol@@ uble and un@@ resolved conflict .
in order to copy the marking into the clip@@ board , you need to copy the copying button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ l @-@ inser@@ tions ) . if this option is activated , you will automatically mark anywhere in the clip@@ board . if this option is careful , but you might be able to see the content of the clip@@ board .
z@@ eil@@ ing will be stored in accordance with the underlying operating system . UNIX variants use a line @-@ up menu \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 ret@@ ains the c@@ aching of the source files , therefore you should use &amp; diff@@ 3 ; also do not use binary files .
the options and the list of files used are automatically saved and recovered during the next start . ( menu setting up &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... )
select a font with fixed width . ( on some systems the dialog features variable width to choose from , but you should not use it . )
if you activate this option , differences in cur@@ sive script will be displayed . if the selected writing does not support this representation , nothing happens .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form , but would be fixed . on these systems , the button will automatically provide an un@@ just colour .
if this option is enabled , the number of tab@@ ulator button is inserted the corresponding number of spaces . otherwise , a tab@@ ulator @-@ character will be inserted .
when entering or return returns , the entry of the preceding line will automatically be used for the next row .
when this option is enabled , each selection will be copied automatically into the clip@@ board , then copying the manual into the clip@@ board .
you can choose which type 2 type you prefer to store . the default value is the commonly used choice on the used operating system .
in the same time , the files tried &amp; diff@@ 3 ; first , all fully identical lines can be found in the source files . in this step , white characters are not ig@@ no@@ red . in this step , white characters will not be ig@@ no@@ red .
some editors ( on some systems ) save a cart ride &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a line thrust &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a row , but then you could save files with different sizes in side @-@ to @-@ side comparison , but how this option has to be disabled , but this option has to be de@@ activated . in default , this option is de@@ activated .
in default , this option is de@@ activated . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and related characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ig@@ no@@ red . the differences are nevertheless displayed , but they will be treated like white characters .
in default , this option is de@@ activated . changes in comments are treated as changes in white characters .
intense after even smaller sub@@ missions . option is enabled in the default . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slowly at very large files .
in automatic further jump mode , this setting , how long will the result of the selection will be displayed , before the next post @-@ next conflict will continue .
dis@@ solves automatically every conflicts in white characters as a source . ( pre@@ set is manual selection . ) It is useful when white characters occur less in time . if you only use the automatic selection of conflicts in numbers or comments when the options are ign@@ ore in numbers or comments when the options are ign@@ ore or Ig@@ nor@@ iere C / C + + .
these options are described in Chapter for scanning of folders and execute a merge tool . check out for details on documentation for directory comparing and mer@@ ging .
if a file is stored , and already an older version exists , then the original version is the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ original file , if already a backup file with the Su@@ ff@@ ix . original exists , it will be deleted without additional backup .
adap@@ ts the language of the user interface . changing the current program does not refer to the current program . you must finish &amp; diffuse , so that the change is active . ( this option is not available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language will be adjusted globally via the control centre . )
the following coefficients settings can be set separately for each entry . if you activate this option , the following settings will be used for all entries .
about the selection fields for coding is a short note that is the local coding . ( this can &apos;t be changed here and has for you p@@ urely inform@@ al character . )
adjust the file coding for source files . this affects how special characters are treated and interpre@@ ting . as the coding for each file can be adjusted individually , even files can be compared and stored .
if you have a file , you can define which coding for store are to be used .
if you define pre @-@ processing command , they could not work with your codec . ( for example , your files can do 16 @-@ bit ASCII , but the pre@@ processing command can only deal with 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) Using this option , you can design@@ ate the coding of the output of pre @-@ processing command .
turn this off to supp@@ ress the modifications of changes in white characters in text or cross@@ ings . ( note : this applies also for changes in numbers or comments when the options are ign@@ ore or Ig@@ nor@@ iere C / C + + comments . )
this selection is only available when you compare three files . however , you may only see the differences between two of three files . after selecting from A &amp; lt ; B , A &amp; lt ; C or B &amp; B ; C will be displayed in addition to normal data column with the required information .
sometimes you would like to use the available square on the screen for long lines . simply use the less important window . ( this option is located in the window menu . )
the compar@@ isons prepared to each other or over each other . this can also be useful to display long lines . ( this option is located in the window menu . )
sometimes , you consider the differences and decide to comp@@ ile the files . a simple click starts to compare the file recovery and use the fil@@ en@@ ame for the last source file as default for the output file . ( if this function is used again , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . )
when reading a file it will pass first to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can use your own pre@@ processor . you can use this function for example , or correct parts or correct it .
when reading a file it is given first to this external command . if also , a normal operating system command was applied ( see above ) , then the output of command is used only in line spac@@ ing . you can write your own pre@@ processor that corresponds to your requirements . each input line has to have one corresponding output line .
the idea behind that user is more flexibility when inser@@ ting the di@@ ff results . however , a external program needs to program , and most users would like to program the good news . however , the good news is that in most cases SE@@ D or Perl .
use this preview processing command for line spac@@ ing for input in large letters : SE@@ D &apos;@@ s / \ \ ( . * \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
CV@@ S and other ver@@ sion@@ ing control systems use some key words ( info : / c@@ vs / Key@@ word sub@@ stitution ) . all will follow the same pattern $ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ run \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
while you experiment with SE@@ D , you might be able to understand and perhaps you like this regular expres@@ sions even . they are very useful because there are many programs which support very similar things .
the no@@ ig@@ no@@ red of numbers is actually a built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ usion . but it is good as an example of a further processing command for line spac@@ e.@@ SE@@ D &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Each character will be replaced by nothing , so it &apos;s deleted .
sometimes you might want to perform more requirements at one time . then you can use the Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; use them to separate the conditions . example :
instead of SE@@ D you can also use some other such as Perl . Perl -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ G@@ EX@@ P / replacement / switches &apos; aller@@ dings are needed with Perl . where SE@@ D \ \ ( and \ \ ) are needed , with Perl only ( and ) without the preceding &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data according to the normal pre@@ processor are retained for the ad and to carry out . the other sur@@ geri@@ es change only the data that the line spac@@ ing is equal to Al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus .
note : in rare cases if you use a normal processor , the line spac@@ ecraft provides the output of the normal resist@@ ive processor as input .
the pre@@ processor commands are very useful but like in any function , the text changes or differences hidden , you can &apos;t notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case .
often , programmers need to edit many files in a folder . you can compare and assem@@ ble complete folder with a diff@@ 3 ; whole folder .
... for each object a proposal to merge : you can custom@@ ize the proposal before the start ,
... can sim@@ ulate the sim@@ ulated changes , sim@@ ulates the sim@@ ulated changes without interrup@@ ting them ,
... leads selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or just using the selected objects ( F6 @-@ key ) .
this is the same and merge of individual files very similar . you must just specify a folder on the command line or in the dialog file .
when three folders will be merged , folder 1 will be used as a basis . if no target folder is specified , uses &amp; diff@@ 3 ; folder as target folder .
note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , not the assembly to start , select the corresponding menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( further details will follow . )
during the reading of the folder you informs about a small news window over current progress . if you loose the folder &apos;s scan , only the files are listed that are compared until then .
when the scanning of the folder is complete , shows &amp; diff@@ 3 ; a list window with results on the left , ...
each file and any folder that was found during the scan is displayed here in a tree . you can choose an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder t@@ inc@@ ture is usually folded up . you can double click on the + / - click on the object button or use the arrow keys for left / right . the directory menu contains two features All types of sub@@ directories and all sub@@ directories can be folded up or folded .
if you double click on a file , the file is started immediately and a comparison window appears .
the symbol in column Name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the file type is different to the other folders , this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detailed windows to the selected object . in such case , the coll@@ ision action cannot be automatically selected . if the assembly run , you will be informed about problems of this kind .
as in the above picture is visible in the columns A / B / C the colors red , green , yellow and black .
identical entries , the color is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different .
folders will be considered as identical if its entire content is identical . then folder the same color . at folder , the age is ir@@ relevant for his color .
the idea to this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colours reflects the colors of a sheet again , which is only green , then yellow and later when it is old , red .
... A and C identical but not B : copy B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target , if it exists )
... A and B are identical but not C : copy C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target , if it exists )
... B and C identical but not A : copy of A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target , if it exists )
... A , B and C does not have the same file type ( e.g. if a file and B a file is ) : error : contra@@ dic@@ tory file types . as long as such objects exist , the assembly can not be launched .
... A and B does not have the same file type ( e.g. if a file and B a file is ) : error : contra@@ dic@@ tory file types . as long as such objects exist , the assembly can not be launched .
the mode for synchron@@ ize is active if only two folders and no exp@@ ort@@ ite target folder , and if the option directories are synchron@@ ously active . then choose the desired action , that the following folder may be identical . if for an entry ...
... A and B exist yet , but not identical : together , and save the result in both folders . ( the user looks as the visible file names for the output file only B ; copied directly after mer@@ ging &amp; diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
if two folders will be merged and select the reset file instead of merge ( un@@ safe ) if the files are different , but the date is identical .. While such errors are not removed , the folders will not be started .
as a result of a file , you will perform a file according to the other . if the merge operation was successful , and according to other reports , if something unexpected occurs , you should try out a final review and see whether the status is everywhere in order .
if in the setup dialog box is selected to view the file size of a Complete analysis , K@@ Diff@@ usion is deleted , no white and white conflicts . ( the column for solved conflicts is only displayed if three folders can be compared or compiled . )
you can either set up the just selected entry ( file or od@@ ds ) or all entries on once . if you have selected all coll@@ ision actions ( even in all sub@@ missions ) , you can start the coll@@ ision .
please note : if you have no target folder , then the Three @-@ file @-@ merge mode C will be used as a target , when two @-@ folder will lead the B as a goal and synchron@@ ization as a goal and / or B is used as a target .
if you select a target folder , check out whether all entries must be displayed in the target folder , even in the folder folder . there are some options to be sk@@ ipped with specific entries . check these options to avoid unnecessary sur@@ prises :
to comp@@ ose all entries : select list comp@@ asses / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the short@@ cut table ) . in order to comp@@ ress only the current entry , select the current element and press F6 .
if the contra@@ dic@@ tory file types still exist , a message appears that shows in@@ correct elements , a message appears that you can then select a valid promotion .
if you merge all entries , a dialog window appears with the options , sli@@ ulate and break down .
select sim@@ ulate if you would like to see what would happen , without which truly changes would be made . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then guide certain actions with all entries . if a manual procedure is necessary ( summar@@ izing a single file ) , then a merge window will open ( note the screenshot ) .
if you are finished with a file , you will start again / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you are still not saved , a corresponding dialog appears . then the diff@@ 3 will continue with the next entry .
if &amp; diff@@ 3 ; on an error , a message appears and detailed status information . at the end of the list , you will see some error messages that can help you to select the cause of the problem or to solve the problem in any way before you proceed to the problem .
if there were some entries individually , notice &amp; diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and will result in the future together all entries . even if the assembly run has been carried out or not saved , these entries will be done as settled . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged again .
the settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... ) now has a section called directory mer@@ ging with these options :
only files that are shown on the specified pattern , are displayed in the element tree . separate samples can be entered with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default file must not correspond to this pattern .
files and folders correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be used as a pattern . the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ one can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as a separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . pre@@ set is * .@@ original ; * .@@ O .
files and folders correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be used as a pattern . the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ one can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as a separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . pre@@ set is * .@@ original ; * .@@ O .
ign@@ ore files that are also ig@@ no@@ red by CV@@ S . many autonomous files are ig@@ no@@ red by CV@@ S . the great advantage is that this folder can be set with an .@@ c@@ v@@ signal file . ( please refer to info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ or . )
in some file systems you have a default attri@@ bute . in other file systems it marks a leading point . this option lets you decide whether these files are displayed in the element tree or not . this option is switched on in default settings .
for links to files : if the option is switched off , symbolic inter@@ sec@@ ts compared . if the option is turned on , the files are compared to which the links are disabled . this is de@@ activated in default .
for links to file : if the option is switched off , the symbolic links are compar@@ ably . if the option is turned on , the links such as normal folders will lead and recur@@ sively reviews . ( note that the option contains a link to itself , would lead to a folder and write &amp; diff@@ 3 ; cr@@ ashes down . ) This option is shut down in default .
a full analysis of each file carries out the statistic columns . ( the number of dissolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and significantly slower , if it does not contain any text . ( specify an appropriate anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare big folders through a slow network , it may be possible to compare only change date and file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you with cau@@ tion . this option is used in default .
similar to confidenti@@ ality date . no real comparison instead . the files are considered as identical if they have lost comparison , if in copying the date of notice lost . please do not use cau@@ tion . this option is used in default .
activ@@ ating the synchron@@ ization mode if two folders are compared to and no target folder . in this mode , the proposals are being identical to both folders . also the results of the files are stored in both folders . this option is switched off in default .
if there are differences , the copying of the newer file will be considered as action . ( this is considered in@@ secure , because the other file is not changed too . you should check this in any case . ) This option is shut down in default .
if a file or folder is replaced by a different file , then the original version is renamed and will receive the extension .@@ original If an old backup file exists with the .@@ original file , this will also include files without backup . this option is turned on by default . this option is switched on in default .
normally , the folders can be seen in combination of individual files ; you can shift the window part with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want to switch the window in the window menu and switch the window in the window menu and switch between the two views between the two views .
probably , you prefer to compare a file just by double click . however , you can also install a single file directly in the directory menu . once you can store the file , the status will be done automatically and the file will not be merged again if you run the folder .
however , this status is lost , if you read the list here : list -@@ Menu : new
K@@ DE supports network transparent with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ Diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way you can specify files and folders to open , which are on local or remote computers .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with a FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder to a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has other syntax for local files and folders . a few things should be considered :
a path can be relatively un@@ owned or .. containing UR@@ Ls are not possible , these are always absolute .
special characters must be tra@@ cked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , idle &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the file system based on the server , sometimes through the protocol . it follows a short list of limitations :
or it cannot be differenti@@ ated whether a link to a file or folder shows . then a link will be accepted as link destination . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) .
there is no way to edit permission or change of change . therefore , the authorization or change date from the original . ( note the option for confidenti@@ ality of the size . ) ( This is only possible in local files . )
the main purpose of processing is currently the differences in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op starts first ever the built @-@ in differences . in order to start K@@ Diff@@ usion , press the right mouse button on the differences and then select In K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu .
usually needs &amp; diff@@ 3 ; two complete inputs . if it is used as a K@@ Part , then the input file extension refers to a patch file in Uni@@ fied format . at least one of the two files needs to exist . then k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch to recover the missing file .
in the con@@ quer@@ or , you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu Preview - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . note that this does not work if any of the original files exist . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the creation of the patch file .
if &amp; diff@@ 3 ; as Part 2 , it only supports the same of two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . the merge or the comparison of folders will not be supported in the K@@ Part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ usion ( now He@@ ist ) is already available . furthermore , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can lead to the diff@@ 3 from the di@@ ff tool collection .
I &apos;m using G@@ PL programs already very long and have learned a lot of other programs in the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all the programmers going through this way or go into such a way .
you have probably compiled the program from the sources and the configure script would not find the right pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in default , K@@ DE will not find resources for user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file you can find more information on this subject .
if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are different times as identical ; if not only a non @-@ white character is different , the line is not identical . if the lines of your next to Each other , this is that ann@@ is co@@ stly . this is the case of this .
the editor will notice for any difference in the files where he starts and where he ends . this important information is lost , if the result is simply stored as text file and it is too much effort to create an own file format that could save this information .
the effort for this was so far too big . you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C . to create greater amounts of text , another editor should be used .
after removing text is suddenly lt ; no sr@@ c lin@@ ux ; released and the text can &apos;t be extingu@@ ished . what does that mean , and how can this be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; already used many colors for outstanding differences . even more Her@@ vor@@ ce would be conf@@ using and missing the purpose . please use another editor .
many good ideas and troub@@ les@@ hooting came from colleagues and many people out of the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
to use all functions of &amp; diff@@ 3 ; you will need &amp; K@@ DE ; 3.1 or newer .
you can find K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE , you can find on the homepage .
you can find a list of the last changes under h@@ tt@@ p : / / diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the Ch@@ ange@@ Log file in the Qu@@ ell package .
to comp@@ ile &amp; diff@@ 3 ; install and install on a system with &amp; K@@ DE , use the following command in the basic folder of the &amp; low diff@@ 3 ; distribution :
K@@ DE @-@ you gives the folder in your system , in which K@@ DE is installed . if you are un@@ safe , you will find more details in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file .
since &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake , you should have no problems when comp@@ ile . should nevertheless difficulties occur , please report to the &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ mail@@ ing@@ lists thereof .
cut out ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or Shift @-@ Remove ) to insert the selected text . insert ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or Shift @-@ In@@ sert ) add the text from clip@@ board to the current cur@@ sor position and replaces the current marking .
only differences : files that are identical in all folders does not appear in folders , and therefore also not in the target folder .
( in the current program version , you have to re @-@ read the folder to update these options . )
only entries are displayed only to the differences . this also causes them to be copied to the target folder . if the target file does not have to be copied to the target folder . if the target file does not have changed to the target folder . ( the behaviour is probably modified in a later program version . ) This option is switched off in default .
note the buttons to choose the source with the label A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines are attached to the end of the selected group in the pane window . if the lines are already present , they will be removed when clicking on the button .
in default , this option is de@@ activated . under@@ lines in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; shows a Mini@@ preview of all virtual work surfaces . it is quite practical to alter the ongoing programs on the work areas to modify their size or move them . this works in a work area than even at several .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual work surfaces as well as those of the applications . applications can be selected and even moves on the work@@ space and to others .
with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved into &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; movement can be moved into space within a work@@ space and other space areas .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked on the empty background of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; however , the context menu does not appear on an application within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; however , only the symbol and name of the application as well as the entries minim@@ ize , maxim@@ ize working area and end . the commands work the following command :
maxim@@ izes the application window to full size of the working area . only if on an application was clicked on .
sends the application to selected virtual work@@ space . only if on an application it appears .
if this check box is selected , window can be shifted within the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the Desktop and also to other work@@ spaces .
when this field is crossed , in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the name of virtual work@@ spaces are displayed .
check@@ box this field can display the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; view the numbers of virtual work@@ space . it is crossed along with name , the name will be equipped with ord@@ inal numbers , &amp; eg ; 1 . working area .
when this field is crossed , the background of each working area will also be shown in the background &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ;
when this field is crossed , the programs will be displayed as small windows in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise , only the empty space areas are displayed to allow their selection .
here the view of the program window selected . simply shows simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the propor@@ tions of the program window . icon shows a small view of the real program window . re@@ mark : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here the arrangement of the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the main window can be known : classic &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; such as P@@ ager applications appear in some other window man@@ o@@ ons ; horizont@@ ally shows all virtual working areas in a horizontal number , which is very good for the presentation at the side of the desktop .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini program in the control strip . it has the advantage that it can display in size as symbols or with their content and re@@ loc@@ ating it outside the control panel .
Click the right button of mouse within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; and then switch to the switch to the dialog box .
at the moment the dialog for Settings can &apos;t be changed . but you can do this manually in the process :

&amp; k@@ mag ; is a screenshot of screen ; for example , you can read a magni@@ fier for the small printed or exact viewing of a photos . this application includes artists , web designers and people with a visual impact . this documentation is intended to be a complete manual for the use of &amp; k@@ mag ;
&amp; k@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly expanded to include new functions . it is optimised for use on weak devices .
if you are &amp; k@@ mag ; a window appears as shown above . the main window is classified as a magni@@ fication window . in the following window , this window will be displayed as a magni@@ fication window . the image , which is displayed in the magni@@ fication window , is called an enlarged area of the screen and is described in the following as the selection dialog .
in the standard settings are increased &amp; k@@ mag ; the area around the mouse hand like an mov@@ eable magni@@ fying glass . alternatively , you can display &amp; k@@ mag ; includes a selected screen range in the magni@@ fication window ( selection level mode ) or the environment of the mouse counter on the screen ( eg ; on the left screen of the screen ) .
if you want to avoid the mouse indicator in the enlarged window , select the mouse cur@@ sor in the enlarged window . please note that the mouse is not able to recognize the form of the mouse . this is always the default K@@ DE ; / Q@@ t ; mouse cur@@ sor .
in the selection window mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it up with the arrow keys and change its size . this can be done in the following ways :
move the mouse into a magni@@ fication window and hold the left mouse button , so you can move the contents of the magni@@ fication window and move them with the arrow keys .
if you additionally , press the &amp; Shift ; check or use the &amp; M@@ MB ; you can move the select window .
with this combination , you can change the size of the selection window . note that the upper left corner of the selection window will be fixed and only move the lower right corner .
&amp; k@@ mag ; has a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer to copy it into a file to insert into the clip@@ board ( to insert it later into other applications ) , the image and much more .
starts or stops the update of the display . the stops of the update causes that the required CPU time has to be 0 .
select the Update rate ( Very low , Ger@@ ing , Medium , H@@ och , Very high ) . the higher the actu@@ alization rate the more CPU time is needed .
in this mode a select window will be displayed . the selected area will be displayed in one window .
&amp; k@@ mag ; automatically setup your set @-@ off command to store files , opening a new window , print , new@@ com@@ or ( with the button document again in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; ) , Enlarge and c@@ lei@@ c &amp; etc .
che@@ er also known as &amp; c@@ magni@@ fier ; is a screenshot one . you can use a magni@@ fier ; for this application use a magni@@ fier icon to view the smaller printed in a newspaper or a photo . this application is for different people of benefits : from research or artists to the web designer or vision .

&amp; c@@ auti@@ fier ; was developed by O@@ laf Schmidt Rein@@ schmi@@ dt @ k@@ de.@@ org and Sar@@ ang Lak@@ are sar@@ ang @ us@@ ers@@ .@@ s@@ f@@ .net and Michael For@@ ster For@@ ster @ f@@ mi@@ .@@ uni @-@ pass@@ au@@ .de .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse click on the same spot as soon as the mouse cur@@ sor a while on the same place . it is thought to help people who suffer from RS@@ I syndrome ( rep@@ et@@ itive strain infected syndrome ) and to which each mouse click pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse click on the same place . it is thought to help people who em@@ ulate a mouse click on the same spot . however , you can em@@ ulate the mouse with the mouse . however , this requires a little exercise .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool . can handle the pain that occurs in order to use the mouse , and helps so many people to assem@@ ble the computer without pain . do you suffer pain that are using the use of your computer , you should consult a physician , unless this has not happened yet .
in order to make it even clear@@ er : even if &amp; m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool should prevent pain , which are caused by clicking with the mouse , it is useful against pain that are caused by loading of mouse , use it . and as with all the ergonomic accessory , the result can fall to each other .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movement and leads a mouse click , once you break the movement shortly .
if the smart transfer is activated , it is em@@ ulated &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool . now move the mouse , wait until the end of movement , before moving the mouse button . in this way you can move the pulling in with pressing mouse button . the intelligent move requires a little exercise , but you get it quickly .
after the end of the mouse movement , this bor@@ ing time has to be st@@ alled before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click brings out .
if Intelli@@ gen@@ us is switched on , the rotation speed is set ( 1 / 10 s ) . this is set the time set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool . after shut@@ down the mouse button is waiting before it takes place , if there is no problem due to the mouse .
&amp; m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool . this function is now enabled , followed by a break , followed by a break , followed by a break , followed by a break , a click with the right mouse button . this moves are stored in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the first time is started , but they can be changed later .
when the sound is delayed , you can move &amp; K@@ DE , to move the response time . open the sound time , select the sound system and here the tab . there is a sli@@ der sound buffer to reduce the response times in order to reduce the response times .
if this setting is marked , it will be launched &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool . at each start of &amp; K@@ DE , this feature is currently only under &amp; K@@ DE , available . at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window divisions , please refer to the corresponding documentation , how to start a program automatically .
put all settings on the values back when opening the dialog . have already pressed the button on the user , the settings will be reset to the user .
best you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; initially with default settings . in particular the intelligent move should not be switched off at first . if you are getting used on automatic mouse , you can later use the intelligent shift .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; K@@ DE , if necessary .
at first , you should make a mouse click on what is a mouse click without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or on positions within the browser window that doesn &apos;t display any link . you can therefore park your mouse on such places until you want to use them again .
if your mouse is moving , you should clean your mouse . it is normally quite easy . the tri@@ ck is that you don &apos;t just clean the mouse , but also the rolls that are in contact with the mouse .
first you need to remove the mouse hemisphere . like this happens , is from mouse to mouse , but it should be clear when you can view the bottom of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the reels . these are on the sides of the Lo@@ ches which the ball was used . dirt and dirt . you can easily scrat@@ ches the ball .
in very rare situations the operating system interrup@@ ts the design of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool . if you &apos;re in this case the intelligent remote control unit , means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is not able to termin@@ ate the operation anymore by using the mouse button .
this is done if you are using &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; using a different window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem exists that you can run a single click . this is the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; reset and you can work as usual .
problem : if you enter text , tries &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to carry out mouse clicks and put the cur@@ sor in a different place .
solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor there where you want to make it . however , you can &apos;t find the mouse on a neutral area of working area , if you need a key mouse click on a neutral area of the mouse , the gray surfaces around the tool bar and menus and the cover lines of windows .
I try to work with an intelligent shift , but I do not create it to edit text .
the smart transfer is a advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it needs its time before you want to move it into the clip@@ board , to move it into the clip@@ board . but it will probably be possible to prepare for any other action . but there will be some problems for them . here are some advice :
don &apos;t use the smart slide if you just start to start &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; click on the end of the text area a mouse click , while you move the mouse button to the other end of the text and put the mouse button on the other end of the text .
you can use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this way , if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button is played like a mouse click . you can just know when using the smart transfer time . later , you can use the smart transfer without the audi@@ ble click . but it requires some exercise .
to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; you can use the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X Window ; it should be installed at most of the system .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble clicks is only available when the system has a sound card and loudspeaker system and are set up correctly .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; used the mouse button as soon as the mouse has been pain@@ ful soon . this program was developed for people who suffer from RS@@ I Syndrome and to whom the firm &apos;s firm has been prepared pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured for a specific time that a pulling process begins , before the mouse is left off . in this way , the mouse can also be carried out and off with the mouse .

the festival is a language output system of the University of Edinburgh . currently , only English , Spanish and W@@ alis@@ ic are currently supported . the license will allow for free to use and without restrictions .
to show an example of command line for setting the voice edition , supp@@ ose that the festival is installed in the / us@@ r / local / Festival . this command is then :
Free@@ T@@ TS is an in &amp; Java ; written voice generator . currently , it only supports the English language . the license allows you to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free and without restrictions .
in order to show an example of the command line for the establishment of a voice print , Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / us@@ r / local / free Wi @-@ Fi . language output is then possible with one of the three following command examples :
for the third example , the option has to be switched on as default one . ( this is the recommended sample for the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ etic into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , therefore you need an additional program to cut the text in phon@@ em@@ es . licence allows you to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert German text to phon@@ eme for MB@@ RO@@ LA , under the ass@@ umption that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / us@@ r / local / fin@@ ro@@ la .
unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax is missing the latest sign of text , so that an additional character must be added . the full command is therefore more elabor@@ ate than in the other examples :
( CAT ) ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / us@@ r / local / mb@@ ro@@ la / / us@@ r / local / mb@@ ro@@ la / de@@ ro@@ la / de@@ fle@@ .@@ wav ; art@@ is@@ ay / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav ; art@@ is@@ ay / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav
all parts of the command must be written in one line . the information must be switched on as default .
the voice @-@ dem@@ on of &amp; K@@ DE ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ further language services provided by all &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ applications a standard interface for language output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various language output systems .
since setting up the voice generator , only in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you must only be possible to use c@@ lich@@ ts@@ ky as a language service in &amp; mouth mouth .
for setting the page K@@ TT@@ SD voice service , which is installed in the dialog box of &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; you need to use a voice generator ( and of course &amp; K@@ DE ; 3.x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB memory ( and additionally memory for the voice generator ) , but it depends on your computer and configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application , with the people who cannot speak , text by the computer can be converted by the computer . there is a list already saved sets , which the user can be re@@ opened again .
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no voice syn@@ thesizer contains . on the computer you have to be a voice syn@@ thesizer .

&amp; kt@@ ts ; - the voice system of &amp; K@@ DE , - is a modules of existing service which enables any application to read text about the &amp; D@@ bus ; interface .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; is a particle system in &amp; K@@ DE , for voice guidance ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common application interface for &amp; K@@ DE ; programmer can be equipped with the applications with T@@ TS capabilities . also the users also offers interesting options .
reading text ( or parts of it ) in the text editor &amp; Kate ; even if &amp; Kate ; in others &amp; K@@ DE , embedded applications .
the language output is performed via the program to @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher , the various background program like es@@ peak , festival , &amp; etc .
allows creation of language editions in command line ( or with Shell scripts ) about the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; support program .
in the future : support for speech mark@@ up languages like Vo@@ ice@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; speech mark@@ up Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and speech mark@@ up @-@ met@@ a @-@ language ( SM@@ ML ) .
the language output Service of &amp; K@@ DE ; , an application without visible windows , offering T@@ TS services via &amp; D@@ bus ; offers .
an application with &amp; GUI ; for configuration and device of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the system phase .
a module for web browser &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; for reading the text of a website or parts thereof .
a module for the text editor &amp; Kate ; can be read entirely or partly read from the text file .
in addition to Bug@@ z@@ illa database of &amp; K@@ DE ; ( h@@ tt@@ p : / / bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de.@@ org / mail@@ box / list info / K@@ DE Acc@@ essi@@ bility List . the developers can also be found in I@@ RC ( ir@@ c.@@ k@@ de.@@ org , channel # K@@ DE @-@ Acc@@ essi@@ bility ) .
before you can use &amp; kt@@ at ; you need to install program with g@@ disp@@ at@@ cher and set correctly . see also
during the first start of kt@@ ops or while still no speakers are set up , the ticket card is shown . see also . if you have set at least one speaker , the ticket card is shown . see .
most T@@ TS syn@@ thesizer provide various languages and voices , such as different male or female , or such that distinguish themselves in volume or speed . you can also set multiple variants for a syn@@ thesizer . you should try at least one speaker before using &amp; kt@@ ts ; because the program speed @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher otherwise used the standard speaker .
several speakers for the same syn@@ thesizer are comparable with several prints for the same printer .
if you click on the map card box in the mu@@ g file , the ticket card is displayed automatically ; it will then automatically start when you start la@@ m@@ gr and is not able to set up a speaker .
all the actors already appear in this list . the preferred speakers will be shown above in the list . the top speaker is used for voice guidance when an application has no speakers .
with a mouse click a speaker from the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list .
with a mouse click a speaker from the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below .
in a mouse click a speaker from the list , and click on this button to push the speaker in the list a row further down@@ wards . the sequence of speaker at the list are also determined its priority .
Click on one of those buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; kt@@ ts ; system .
choose a vo@@ cal type , there are three male and three female voices , as well as a j@@ gen@@ ome and girls voice .
when you click here , click on the new actors on the card reader . to change the settings of this speaker , click on Edit menu .
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; already almost use . go back to the map of map and check whether the T@@ TS service provided by &amp; K@@ DE . see . now , you can read and manage text in order to create text mot@@ ions , and manage text mot@@ ions . see .
if you have set up at least one speaker , you can start the language output system by &amp; K@@ DE ; Click on the map card box in order to open this map card . here you can adjust some general options .
select this check box to activate the &amp; kt@@ ts ; this start is successful , the ticket card will be displayed and read text mot@@ ions . see . remove the mark , K@@ TT@@ SD is attached and the T@@ TS system by &amp; K@@ DE ; de@@ activated .
when the m@@ gr is terminated , it runs &amp; kt@@ ts ; further , if the field output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
if this check box is selected and kt@@ s@@ m@@ gr automatically appears in the system range of the control strip , once the preliminary is complete .
with the buttons in this series , you can start rub@@ bing mot@@ ions , stop and keep it again .
with the buttons in this series , you can read the current text in &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ clip@@ board should be able to read or send a text file to advance . you can also change the speaker for a job .
Click on User or OK , then all changed settings on all pages are taken on .
the ticket orders will only be displayed if K@@ TT@@ SD was launched . in order to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the map card box General and cross the language output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; K@@ DE , you can read the text of the displayed website . check out the text which should read , and select the main menu tools text . after a short time , the language output should start .
it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a website . you can also sk@@ ip this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; pre@@ st@@ acks and other invisible brands are also read .
in &amp; Kate ; the extended text editor of &amp; K@@ DE , you can check out the text , check out whether &amp; kt@@ ts ; and then select the text to read the text , and select the main menu tools . then the language output should start .
this also works if &amp; Kate ; embedded in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta .
K@@ not@@ ation is the news system of &amp; K@@ DE , which you can be notified of you specified events . you can also read the text of this news from &amp; kt@@ ts .
in &amp; conversation ; the I@@ RC program of &amp; K@@ DE , you can address various kinds of messages . you can notice &amp; conversation ; for example , if you can be notified when your nickn@@ ame occurs , in which your nickn@@ ame is present . you can then read the I@@ RC news text .
supports a &amp; K@@ DE ; program K@@ Not@@ er , appears out a menu entry to the menu settings of this program . this is possible to differenti@@ ate the possible settings for your not@@ ation .
filter to the character set , you have a good possibility to correct &amp; kt@@ ts ; is a good example . you remove the tags b@@ r and b out of the news that can be sent by mail , and also the expression / local / In@@ box , as it can be assumed in most cases , as provided .
filters are an advanced abilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ops ; filters are not necessary .
in Fil@@ ters , a text is processed until he is sent to the program of the disp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful for improving the language , to choose wrong words or ab@@ brevi@@ ations , to choose a proper language and speaker to handle any short@@ com@@ ings of language syn@@ thes@@ izers and their voices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order to understand the work of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tre@@ ble @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works with a text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; distingu@@ ishes four types of texts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the issu@@ ance of Screen Re@@ a@@ dern has the highest priority . it will be presented to all other entries and will keep this orders . if the output of the screen Reader is read , the orders received will be resumed .
war@@ nings have the next priority . this level is important messages such as &amp; eg ; processor is used to get hot . a warning sign and holds the issue of messages and norm@@ ative text . these orders will be continued after the warning .
News have the next priority claim . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example for an application to read the messages . while you can read a long text on a website , you can use &amp; k@@ mouth ; someone welcome you to enter the room . &amp; K@@ DE ; alerts are also news . read it .
the rest are simple text mot@@ ions . each order , which is used by card orders , is a text order . KS@@ ay@@ it is an example of applications that uses textile orders . text orders are intended for the edition of longer texts that have no special ur@@ gency .
all four orders will be processed in waiting @-@ long , with the exception of the output of Screen Re@@ aders . if an application sends the output of Screen Re@@ aders , whereas &amp; kt@@ ts ; just such a result , this issue will be stopped and finished .
first you need to know that filter should never be applied to the output of Screen Re@@ a@@ dern . they are applied to normal war@@ nings , news and text applications as well as &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ News .
filter edit the text , and continue on the next filters . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are done as modules . in the future there can be more types of filters .
choose parts of a text to be replaced by other text . the following parts can be used either as words or as regular expres@@ sions , which allow the creation of chat @-@ emot@@ icons such as : - ) by text or for the conversion of messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; by mail ; in a better comprehen@@ sible form .
&amp; XML , trans@@ duc@@ er use a X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from a format into another format . in delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; some X@@ SL@@ T files are contained in the translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; available in SS@@ ML .
with Spe@@ akers , you can depend on the content of text , or depending on the program , sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; if you set a female voice as an female voice card , you can read text from K@@ DE news about it .
each of these various filters are adjustable rules , after which it is applied to a voice output . if the filter does not ensure that its rules are not necessary , he gives the text unchanged at the next filters .
if a text order , a message , warning , or a &amp; K@@ DE , notification on &amp; kt@@ ts ; it will be processed by all activated filter that are set up on the page below . processing by the filter takes place in the list from top to bottom .
this shows the list of typical filters . is a filter not crossed , it is not enabled and is not used . filter will be returned from top to bottom .
Click here to insert a new filter . select the type of the filter , and it will display the dial@@ ogs below .
to enter a list of words or regular expres@@ sions as a comparison sample set . these samples are exchanged in the text , then the text is exchanged for the corresponding replacement text . major and small adjustment will not be compared with the comparison .
1 . enter your name for your filter . you can choose from any name , it must be different from the name of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expres@@ sions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the string in the column and replace it in accordance with the string from the column . the list is shown in the displayed order from above to below .
Click here to push the marked word or regular expression in the list .
with this buttons you can load a list of words or regular expres@@ sions from a file , the current list or delete . download a list from a file , the entries from the file will be attached to the existing list .
here is a language registered here , the filter is only applied when the speaker is placed one of the languages chosen here . Click on the button to hold a list of languages . you can also select several languages if you click on the mouse click the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l button .
if a value is registered here , the filter is only applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can set multiple programs separated by comp@@ at@@ a . example : conversation , k@@ mail
the application @-@ ID running programs can be obtained with the q@@ d@@ bus program ; the &amp; D@@ bus ; numbers must be b@@ lown up . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application @-@ ID head @-@ 34@@ 32 may only be assigned to you .
the character set filter is then applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the Box Di@@ esen filter if you agree . all input fields are empty , the filter will be applied to all texts .
by comparison of words , the character set filter is used for regular expres@@ sions in the form \ \ s Word \ \ s. the words must thus be limited on both sides ( spaces ) .
in this manual you will not find instructions for writing of regular expres@@ sions . if you have installed &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions are displayed in the package .
&amp; XML ; converts &amp; XML ; with using X@@ SL@@ T files from one format into another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML , Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3C standard for such trans@@ forms . however , the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c can be installed on your system .
enter the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c can be reached via the ambient @-@ variable Path , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is also enough .
with the Inter@@ phone optional filter , you can send texts to a specific speaker , which is set up on the map speaker , or at a speaker with certain characteristics . you can define that texts by k@@ mail should be read from a female voice . see .
before reading &amp; kt@@ ts , there is a speaker for the text . the speaker is chosen according to the text tab , which the program sends the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; and the characteristics of the speaker desk speaker is selected . with the Inter@@ phone optional filter , you can over@@ write the chosen speaker .
if the value is registered here , the filter is applied , if the text has the given regular expression . is installed on your system of &amp; K@@ DE ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; you can call this with one click on the button to get help .
to achieve a faster processing , you should try to an@@ cho@@ red the regular expression at the start of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
place the characteristics of the desired filter conditions here . if the text had been shown above the filter conditions , the speaker is selected to display the desired requirements on the h@@ ott@@ est . Click on the button to display the dialog box .
use this buttons to save your microphone settings , or delete all the settings .
the Inter@@ phone optional filter is only applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the Box Di@@ esen filter if you need at least a condition .
the language output API , by &amp; K@@ DE , with the programmer to award its applications T@@ TS capabilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; D@@ bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with voice syn@@ thesizer are added to K@@ TT@@ SD , so that &amp; kt@@ ops . this syn@@ thesizer can use .
the following section includes a short description of the &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ D@@ bus ; interface of the AP@@ Is . the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is can be found on K@@ DE , Acc@@ essi@@ bility website ( h@@ tt@@ p : / / bil@@ bil@@ it@@ y.@@ k@@ de.@@ org ) .
applications for voice information about the &amp; D@@ bus ; -@@ interface by &amp; K@@ DE ; from the product to the object K@@ ill .
to read text about text read and option is a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc .
there are even more commands that you can use . give you a list of all commands
open two &amp; console - window . start the following window in a window , then the mu@@ g s@@ gr in the other .
none of the af@@ o@@ rem@@ enti@@ oned voice syn@@ thesizer supports my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
I created the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ XML filter , but when using the module for festival are not read .
due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you need to install the ( male British ) voice Rab _ di@@ phone , so that if you do not function these voice to read from websites . make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and can be found via the environmental variable Path .
certain characters or inter@@ pun@@ ctu@@ ation seem to cause errors in syn@@ thesizer , so that whole sentences will be spent , and what can I do ?
first , make sure the option of character encoding is set for the appropriate language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , this may be fixed by a string set filter . see .

the program &quot; with @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; is using a custom@@ iz@@ able module architecture for voice syn@@ thes@@ izers . if you want to expand &amp; kt@@ ts ; to use another syn@@ thes@@ izer , use the team team in conjunction with the Developer Team .
the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; it is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the command ap@@ t @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
to comp@@ ile &amp; kt@@ ts ; you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or newer ) including the pack@@ ets of deli@@ bs and the development files for the program &quot; go @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot;
if you have downloaded the source texts of &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source text archive for k@@ de@@ cryp@@ bility or to have downloaded every night of the tar@@ ball , and install the program with the following commands :
before you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; check first if ordinary @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher with your voice syn@@ thesizer is really working correctly . you can use the Sh@@ ell@@ ry SPD @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ at ; in &amp; K@@ DE ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ops ; which is to be developed as the program of the disp@@ at@@ cher . the program command ms@@ gr is supposed to be further developed and the SPD @-@ conf script is no longer required .
a long text is dismant@@ led in single propositions . the user can return to repeat or break down the issue , keeping it or break the issue .
if there is an application text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; for example , it can choose the properties of the preferred speakers for the output . if you want to know one speaker , whose language English and its gender is female , otherwise you want to know more about how &amp; kt@@ ts ; a speaker is chosen you will see in .
if you click on the card reader , click on the box , and then click on Edit menu button . as an example , the map plate kit is shown below . for example , please refer to the establishment of the module for Festival Interactive . details on the modules are available .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable program . if the path is to the Festival in Path , you must only enter the festival .
select the string coding for text which will be handed to the Festival . in voices , the &amp; kt@@ ts ; these settings are automatically performed . generally , Western languages are using ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages such as c@@ zech or Slov@@ ak@@ ian , ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these sli@@ ps provide volume , microphone speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot select a kno@@ b , and these grey will not be shown by you selected voice this settings .
some votes like Multi@@ Sy@@ n votes will be loaded in size several seconds due to their size . if you are using this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so that the first set will be syn@@ thes@@ ized faster at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD .
if this check box cannot be selected , you have not set up a speaker ( or forgot to users ) .
if this check box is displayed , the program window will be displayed on the start of the program window . otherwise , after start@@ up only the icon must be seen in the system stage , but not the program window . Click on the icon in the system stage to display the program window .
if this check box is not selected and it doesn &apos;t continue , it appears in the system range , once K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . thus , you have the possibility to read or to control the device .
here are all the orders placed in the waiting time , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of propositions and the just worked sentence . the speaker ID corresponds to the ID on the card reader .
with the buttons in this series you can find a full trip in the order that is listed below in the list below . ( but not each order is composed of several sets ) .
with a click on OK all the modifications of the settings ( even on the other cardboard card ) will be resi@@ zed down to the symbol of the system stage . Click on this icon to view the program window .
if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the audio card audio . see also .
here are only passages listed and managed . issues of Screen Re@@ a@@ dern , War@@ nings and News are not displayed . for more information about the news types of &amp; kt@@ ts , you will find in .
select the type of audio output . if a component can &apos;t be selected , &amp; kt@@ ts ; either without support for the appropriate audio module , please do not load the required libraries .
if G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Co@@ de is to be used for the audio output , select the audio output . if no output modules are displayed on the list , you must select at least one module , select the PCM unit . see also
set the microphone speed here . 50@@ n@@ bsp ; % corresponds to about half and 200@@ n@@ bsp ; % about the double normal data speed . so that these settings can be implemented , the program SO@@ X has to be installed .
Click on User to acquire the new settings for the current &amp; kt@@ ts ; system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices comprises all PCM units and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you need to find out what device works with you . in doubt , select standard .
on this map ticket you can setup special actions , which will always be executed if the text order from a message is interrupted with a higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four types of language contracts :
the issu@@ ance of Screen Re@@ a@@ dern has the highest priority . it will be presented to all other entries and with@@ holds these orders . after the output of the screen Reader was read , the requested orders will be resumed .
war@@ nings have priority here . this level is important messages such as &amp; eg ; processor is used to get hot . a warning will keep the issue of messages and norm@@ ative text . these orders will be continued after the process of the warning .
News have the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application to read the messages . if you read &amp; eg ; just a long text can be read on a website , you can welcome you in the room .
will create a text order by sending a message , warning , or the issue of a Screen Re@@ aders , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio is in qu@@ eu@@ e .
this audio file will always be played when a normal text job will be interrupted . if both advanced sound and introductory message will be played , the introductory sound will be played before the introductory news .
the settings on this map card only apply to normal text mot@@ ions . for news , war@@ nings and issues of Screen Re@@ a@@ dern , there are no special promotions if they are interrupted by a message with a higher priority .
to read with &amp; kt@@ ts ; Click to read the auto@@ graph messages , click on my alerts . the ticket card messages will be published .
mark this check box to switch the advantages of &amp; K@@ DE ; dis@@ ables . if this setting is not marked , the other settings are disabled and write ; read no alerts .
if this setting is marked , alerts are to be recorded where a sound is played , of &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read .
use this buttons to add or delete the events to add or from it . if you click on the button , a dialog appears where you want to add the application and the event you want to add to list .
this event reads the message before , the &amp; conversation ; sent , if someone is mentioned in an I@@ RC message your nickn@@ ame .
all events that are given in the list is nothing stated , are ign@@ ited by &amp; kt@@ ts ;
use this select field to establish what &amp; kt@@ ts ; to do if an event hits . you have the following selection options :
if you set custom text , enter the desired text . you can use the following plac@@ eholder :
you can enter the features of the desired speaker . the standard cho@@ oses the speaker , shown in the list on the map plate as top of the selected entry . see also .
note that there is three levels for events . if the action is specified for a specific application of a specific application , this will be executed . otherwise , the action is specified for all other events of the specific application . as last option , the action is scheduled for carrying under standard ( all other events ) .
the event All noti@@ fications for the application Standard ( any other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this purpose , you can set up the previous noti@@ fications as follows :
use the button Save to save the settings for the alerts . if you want to download saved settings from a file . if you want to start saved settings , click on delete . all entries except any discrimination are deleted .
the speech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3C standard to mark text for the control of voices , the gender voice and sound height . also marks for the control of the pron@@ unci@@ ation for example Ab@@ brevi@@ ations . SS@@ ML is a part of the Vo@@ ice@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3C standard .
currently reading &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following limitations are available :
you need to install the Rab _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) , since this is the standard one to use the festival in the output of SS@@ ML .
if the settings for speed or pitch in the Festival configuration dialog is not limited to 100@@ n@@ bsp ; % , SS@@ ML text is usually very mon@@ ot@@ on .
&lt; ! &#91; CD@@ O &#93; &lt; ? XML version = &lt; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UTF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &lt; ! Doc@@ type Con@@ thesis 1.0 / / W@@ 3C / / D@@ TD , who has slept in my bed ? asked m@@ om Bear . who has slept in my bed ? asked the bear ind . &#93; &#93; &gt;
there are two types of filters - normal filters and pro@@ positi@@ onal identification filters ( SD@@ B filters ) . this can &apos;t begin faster with the presentation , as if only the first set can be syn@@ thes@@ ized or stop or stop and break , even if the voice syn@@ thesizer are not directly supported .
here you see the pro@@ positi@@ onal character set . for the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts ; it is automatically set up as a set of a set @-@ limit@@ er filter . you can change the settings or other proposition limits , but will be do@@ omed .
at the sim@@ pl@@ est , you will learn how to read the device cho@@ ices from and place your text . switch on the card selection again , change some features and check how the selection of the speaker has changed , and , of course , you have to have set up more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; then qu@@ icker with the reading , since only the first set can be processed and not the whole text block that can take very long ,
they will then request orders on the map of map or termin@@ ate this function , even if the voice syn@@ thesizer does not support this function .
for these reasons , the normal pro@@ positi@@ onal load filter is automatically set up if you start la@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be removed only . do not change anything on this filter , unless you know what you do .
pro@@ positi@@ onal sign filter compare text with a regular expression for pro@@ positi@@ onal sign ( dec@@ im@@ al@@ code 8 ) to the set borders ( dec@@ im@@ al@@ code 8 ) in front of the fil@@ tering automatically from the text . note that the standard movement of limits will retain the character level .
S@@ BD filter never be applied to &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ messages ( cra@@ y@@ fy ) , war@@ nings , messages or the output of Screen Re@@ a@@ dern .
if you have removed the normal pro@@ positi@@ onal characteristic filter , you can return this once again by charging the standard _ sb@@ ad@@ c file standard .
on the card ticket selection , you can over@@ write the microphone settings for application . the map card is displayed if
using the default speaker ( the top on the card reader ) . other words : no microphone properties are specified .
use of the matching speaker , which points all the characteristics of a speaker . if you choose to delete or edit the settings of the speaker , choose the speaker ; otherwise select &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker at which the earliest recorded the originally set features .
select the method for input the desired data properties , by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
select the characteristics of the desired speaker . if this feature does not play any role , enter nothing .
mark this check box when the feature priority is to have other features . you can also set multiple markings .
as the language is a critical factor in the issue of issue , this will always be treated as a pre@@ emin@@ ent property . if you don &apos;t want to specify the attri@@ bute language , if you may know that a specific application text is in another language as being introduced in the working environment .
to use all the properties in the field of speaker , to delete the following pages , then click on the default button standard and then use the speaker , which corresponds to the following .
in this case , 0 for the last text order in qu@@ eu@@ e . you can also specify a order number . ( without the order number is the entry 0 required ) .

on the map , it provides a setting speed . so this works , the program SO@@ X has to be able to be able to set up the program SO@@ X . some syn@@ thes@@ izers module such as festival Interactive offer a setting for speed . depending on the chosen voice , this active or in@@ active .
the settings for the speaking speed are ig@@ no@@ red when &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; reads that the HTML should be controlled in SS@@ ML . ( see ) or if you are very cour@@ ageous , change the .x@@ sl file of &amp; HTML ; -@@ according to the SS@@ ML filter , and set the microphone speed up .
I create it not to read web pages with a female voice . I set up a female festival speaker , but &amp; kt@@ ts ; read the websites with a male voice .

Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thesizer , whose source code is generally well , and there are several voices and languages supported . in many voices , you can adjust the volume , speaking velocity and pitch @-@ height with &amp; kt@@ ops .
you need to install at least one language . help you find in the instructions given to the festival . would you like to read web pages , you need to install the ( male British ) voice Rab _ di@@ phone .
for these voices , you must comp@@ ile an additional module , hence you need the source code from Festival . the German votes are subject to limitations during the transfer .
this voice requires Festival 1.@@ 95 beta or newer . the voice is still in an early development stage . un@@ pack the software in the festival / li@@ b / voc@@ als / Russian / . if you enter the Russian voices , you must select a yr@@ illi@@ c ( 8 @-@ bit ) coding , such as CO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
the Festival is normally contained in the &amp; Linux ; distri@@ butions . they are therefore looking for as first on the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian , or Czech languages , encoding must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you wish to use the Russian voice , the coding must be set on a 8 @-@ bit Cy@@ ren@@ ally , like e.g. CO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
the festival can be used together with the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; -@@ Syn@@ thesizer . then , the le@@ x@@ ographic analysis and &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; created out the audio output . the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; -@@ program and the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; voices can be downloaded from

this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; short@@ work@@ conf ; a module for the &amp; controller center , which allows to manage network interfaces , routine and DNS settings .
the &amp; controller center ; allows users to manage a series of system and desktop settings via a unified , integrated surface . the &amp; controller center can be accessed by selecting the K Menu control@@
the &amp; b work@@ conf ; package has been developed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; controller ; create a simple interface for the following tasks :
after installation , a new module network settings will be displayed by selecting the network settings ( link work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting the controller ; Internet &amp; network networking settings in &amp; menu .
it is important to understand that &amp; cra@@ p work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot install . physical devices and their drivers have already been able to install and configured to connect the device at all and to set the network properties .
in most cases , drivers for the network hardware and other devices are installed on installing &amp; Linux ; with installed and set up , network appliances are added later , the drivers have to be loaded according to the kernel version , according to the kernel version :
the module network settings will be loaded if the option is selected to detect networking settings in the &amp; k@@ controller ; index settings , using the module &apos;s network settings , to automatically detect the platform on the system automatically .
if the platform cannot be recognized , the single selection is offered . it is the platform from the list , which the distribution and the release is best . by identi@@ fying the setup non @-@ pol@@ ls can be set permanently . at the next start of the network settings , this selection will be automatically pre @-@ set .
the change of network settings are only possible in system management mode . previously , all options are displayed gray , which means the settings can only be considered . in the system management mode you can only be found in system management mode at the right end of the module . it is the input of the password required .
the entire functionality of the module is available in the system management mode . this is divided into three riders :
the rider network interfaces is for managing the network devices of the system . all available network appliances are displayed . by rider network interfaces , the following tasks can be carried out :
the displayed network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button port ... in the dialog box .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . clicking the button of Advanced Settings displays the dialog with further possibilities .
with the selection of automated , the TCP / IP settings will be collected from a D@@ H@@ CP Server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , TCP / IP information is required for the system . in the selection list , the TCP / IP information is required . in the selection list , either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP can be selected according to the system .
with the selecting Manu@@ ally you can do the TCP / IP configuration without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . in the input field IP address , the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . in the input field network mask is set to set the sub@@ net@@ mask .
if this option is marked , the system initi@@ ates the network interface during bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not allowed , this option should not be activated .
the values specified in this dialog will be shown as the characteristics of the device in the device driver .
it should be ensured that the IP address is already used in the network . the input of an already existing IP address would result in TCP / IP conflict . you can notice whether the address is already in use . in doubt the network must be asked .
networking devices can be activated or switched off or switched off . switching off @-@ off network device will be activated by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface ....
networking devices can be activated or switched off or switched off . turn off from a activated network device via selecting from the list and clicking the interface ....
puts the IP address of the computer in local sub@@ net that uses physical connection to remote networks and is used as standard for TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ networks .
if the computer is more than a network interface , the interface must be selected to the net in which the gateway is selected .
a computer with DNS support replaces the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers may only understand IP addresses . if the computer h@@ tt@@ p is required : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS will dis@@ solves this name into an IP address such as 12@@ 3.4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the calcul@@ ator for the name resolution part of the horse name resolution allows a simple administration of this list . items can be added , removed or changed value . DNS entries can be upgraded up or down in the priority using buttons or down in the priority .
when pressing the button closure ... from the group calcul@@ ator to the name resolution , a DNS server can be added . it will be shown to the New Nam@@ es@@ er@@ ver .
first you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the button . the entry is then inserted in the list .
from the group of calcul@@ ator to name resolution , select a entry and then click Edit button .... It will edit the dialog .
the @-@ known computer calcul@@ ates computer @-@ name IP address references to the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used on bo@@ oting , if no DNS server is available . in small , finished networks can replace it DNS server .
normally , the list contains some entries that support &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IPv6 addresses are supported , which should be replaced in the test version of IP should be replaced in the future version 4 .
then enter the IP address of the well @-@ known computer and then click &quot; Add .... The New &quot; dialog box will be displayed .
to add the name of the well @-@ known computer and click the button . if the well @-@ known computer has several also known as @-@ names , then button lists several times and enter the other as @-@ names .
select an associated entry of a well @-@ known data from the list and select Edit .... The MP3 dialog box will be shown .
you can run one of the following tasks , then with clicking on OK it will update the list of static hosts .
the settings used in Module Network Settings are not immediately effective in the system . to activate the changes , the following command must be set in one &amp; console .
the homepage of &amp; cra@@ p work@@ conf ; is h@@ tt@@ p : / / kne@@ eling conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , which you can download the latest version of the source text .
for installation of binary distri@@ butions ( mostly rpm packages ) it is enough if &amp; K@@ DE ; and Q@@ t have been installed .
the installation of the completed version is recommend@@ able for less experienced users . it is just downloading the rpm package and install in a &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
alternatively a tool can be used with graphical interface like a package or the installation tool of their distribution .
for this case the installation of Q@@ t and K@@ DE , not enough , but additionally the development packages are needed with libraries and other things .
however , this is recommended only experienced users . however , it is not difficult to comp@@ ile &amp; kne@@ eling . to comp@@ ile the following commands .
in the first section of this cap@@ els you will be given important information about basic network technology , in the second , all of &amp; kn@@ et@@ work@@ conf will be discussed .
this section may not replace more information about IP networks . in this app@@ endix only basic information about the integration of the PC in a small ( home ) network .
currently , IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IPv@@ 4 ) . IPv@@ 5 has never been able to spread . IPv6 is expected to pass through the near future . this description therefore focuses on the common IPv@@ 4 .
one of the most important information is to as@@ sign the IP address of a network interface . in foreign networks , am &amp; eg ; the network administrator can be used or if available , D@@ H@@ CP can be used , if your IP address can be easily configured to any case !
when using a specific small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from an especially suitable for this purpose to avoid IP address fli@@ ck@@ ering with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwarded to the Internet , therefore any use is possible .
of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be made by setting up one Gat@@ ew@@ ays .
for smaller networks usually addresses addresses in the range from 192.168.@@ 1.1 to 192.168.@@ 1.@@ 254 . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 255.@@ 255.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so all the computers are in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .0.0 and 12@@ 7.0.0@@ .1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the Second the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own machine ) . the default route is required for the IP res@@ line .
the 12@@ 7.0.0@@ .1 network address is reserved for IP traffic in local own machine . usually , the address 12@@ 7.0.0@@ .1 is an own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface which works like a closed circle .
in this part , the configuration files that are listed by &amp; kn@@ ot@@ conf ; they are affected and stored in the various distri@@ butions .
this file can sometimes be dynamic in DSL connections , so it is not surprised if in the event of active DSL connections there is another content as specified .
for &amp; SuSE ; it is known that this file is not sorted by scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config file . another stand as expected can occur .

&amp; dat ; is a f@@ use for tape drives on the basis of t@@ ar . it also offers the opportunity to create multiple archives on a band . the second goal was to answer a question that asked my wife : how much longer lasts until you are sec@@ ures ?
before a band can be used , it must be done by &amp; dat ; it can happen on three ways :
&amp; dat ; board the band back and read the pre@@ st@@ ressing of the band . recognizes &amp; dat ; the sp@@ ell on the band will not be asked if the band is being format@@ ted .
recognize &amp; dat ; if it is searching for the appropriate index on your disk . can &apos;t this be found , you will be asked if the Band@@ index is to be created .
everything has been smooth , changing the symbol for the tape drive , to display that the tape was mounted . in the status bar there is a corresponding message . the content of the band can now be searched for the tape .
before the thro@@ wing of the belt , first the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to apply this :
dat , by changing the symbol of symbol for the band , you can realize that the integration for the band was solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the band can now be cast without any danger .
before a band of &amp; k@@ dat ; can be used , it must be format@@ ted by &amp; dat ;
a band types must be format@@ ted before you can order to save data . this procedure must not be format@@ ted before using &amp; dat ; this process can usually be format@@ ted by the band of &amp; k@@ dat . flo@@ ppy disk drives do not require a form@@ att@@ ing of the band pre@@ ference , D@@ AT drives on the other hand .
after entering the band called and the capacity , goes down &amp; dat ; with the form@@ att@@ ing of the band . all data on the band is lost automatically ! after completion of the form@@ att@@ ing process , the volume is tied automatically and is ready to use .
before you asc@@ ending the backup process , you must select the required files . that can happen on three ways :
select a file or folder in local file tree . only this file or folder will be secured .
mark a f@@ use profile in tree . they are only backed up to the files specified in the profile .
select files in local file tree with a hamm@@ ers . only the selected files and / or sub @-@ folders are secured .
Click with the right mouse button on the local file tree and select in the menu of Sich@@ ers ...
once the backup was initiated , the dialog opens up for backup . in this dialog , you can try to check the selected files and change the settings for backup .
if you have confirmed the settings , the dialog appears . the dialog shows the progress of the backup process including the data rate and the remaining time .
select a file or folder in one of the files in the entry for the drive . only the selected file or folder will be checked .
select the files in one of the files in the entry for the band with a hem@@ at@@ cher . only the selected files and / or sub @-@ folders are examined .
Click with the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu entry ....
once the test procedure was started , the dialog for Settings - Check the dialog . in this dialog you can check your selection and change the work folder for the review .
if you have confirmed the settings for checking the review , the dialog box appears . this dialog shows the progress of the review process as well as data throughput and the remaining time .
before you can manage the restore , the files must be recovered . this can be done on two ways :
select a file or folder in any of the archives created for the tape drive . only the selected file or sub @-@ folders will be restored .
select the desired files from any of the archives with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub folders will be restored .
right with the right mouse button on a file or folder in one of the archives and select in the menu ....
once the restore process was started , the dialog for Rest@@ ore . in this dialog , you can check your selection and edit the work@@ folder for restoration .
once you have set the settings for restoration , the dialog appears to restore . this dialog shows the progress of recovery process as well as data throughput and the remaining time .
sometimes it is necessary to re@@ produce the inde@@ x@@ ural file from the tape . this process will delete all existing inde@@ x@@ ing files for this band . you can re@@ build the index on two types of the band :
this is a backup profile with the just selected files and the default settings . you can set the following settings for a backup profile :
the current folder , in which the backup should be made . the list of securing files will be updated automatically according to the selected working folder .
for all folders that are listed under the backup files that are only backed by the file system that are located on the same file system , such as the folder . folder that are on other file systems you can enter separately under backup files . each entry is considered by t@@ ar regardless of the others .
to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snap@@ shot file is used since the last incre@@ mental backup . only the files that have since changed since then .
the name of the file which is used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
delete the snap@@ shot file before the call of t@@ ar . this causes that all files will be backed up and created a new snap@@ shot file for the next backup .
the functionality of buttons files &amp; gt ; and lt ; lt ; files were not fully implemented at the time of compilation of this documentation .
settings can set the settings over the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . the following settings can be provided :
the complete path to device file for the belt drive ( normally / dev / T@@ ape ) . this path must be transferred to the non @-@ re@@ winding version of the belt .
if this setting is active , transmitted &amp; dat ; before the band is bound , the command is going to load on the drive . with some drives can be done before reading and write operations .
if the option is switched on , try &amp; dat ; it is possible to lock the belt &apos;s drop@@ outs . possibly , this setting is not working on all tape drives .
if the option is switched on , the lin@@ eup of the integration of &amp; k@@ dat ; automatically e@@ jected the tape . use this option not on Flo@@ ppy Stre@@ am@@ ers .
if the option is switched on , try &amp; dat ; not all drives support variable block size . no matter whether this setting is active or not , you have to carry out &amp; dat ; in any case the block size for your tape drives share .
if &amp; dat ; a band format@@ ted , it sends a file to the beginning of the band . this file should only take a memory block on the tape . the contents of the file is composed as follows :
( n Byte ) The band @-@ ID . the format of this string is computer name : second , whereby computer name is format@@ ted on which the band is format@@ ted . seconds , the number of seconds , which has passed since the ep@@ och , has been format@@ ted by the band .
the band @-@ ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat / .
the remaining files on the band are pure t@@ ar @-@ archives created directly with &amp; GNU / - t@@ ar . even other t@@ ar versions should work so long as it is not an incre@@ mental f@@ uses .
check the contents of a backup folder . this icon is only active if a band is involved .
&amp; ks@@ log log ; is a &amp; K@@ DE ; viewer for system protocols . the program is reserved for in@@ experienced users where you can address information about your system or where the system enables you to access the various protocol files . furthermore , the system allows quick access to quick access to information about problems that occur on their server .
&amp; ks@@ setup log ; helps to understand what your computer makes in the background . the program is a simplified picture of the protocol files of its own system . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users where you can receive information about your system or where the system is stored for the various protocol files .
in addition , it enables improved users to provide quick access to information about problems that occur on their server . &amp; ks@@ ystem log ; tries to provide some expanded functionality , with which help the protocol files are filtered and evaluated .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 &amp; ks@@ setup log ; a number of useful features include :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba
many other features are also included and are explained in the additional chapters of this manual .
as you can see in the following screen photograph , the system log@@ ue is provided , with their help to easily filters and sort the individual protocol lines of a protocol file . the individual possibilities for sorting and fil@@ tering are shown in the next chapter of this hand@@ book .
after the start to start &amp; boot log log ; initially the most important protocol file of the system - the system protocol - to open you , and it takes place under Linux normally in the file / var / log , for normal users , usually no just@@ ification to reading .
you can also use the filter bar to filters after a limited range of characters . in the default configuration , the selection box contains only displayed , so that the selection box contains only displayed , if in one of the columns you have the string of the filter search term .
you can also select a different entry in this section . for example , in the protocol file system , select the column process only with entries in the protocol &apos;s name , so shows you &amp; ks@@ log log ; all protocol lines which were sent or produced from this process .
this option is activated in the default settings , and helps you recognize the important protocol lines . protocol lines of level mist@@ akes are displayed with a consp@@ ic@@ uous color than protocol lines of the level hint . the color display of protocol lines can be disabled .
if you want to display only certain process ( e.g. in system protocol or in the cr@@ on Protocol ) , so you can examine the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the column process . this can then be useful for example to start the Sam@@ ba server . in this case you use filter bar .
furthermore , you can activate the option to new lines in the context menu of the master window to view all new web @-@ coming protocol lines .
&amp; ks@@ log log ; enables the display of several protocol files in separate sub@@ windows . to open this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional windows . once you select a sub @-@ window , select the menu on display in the menu .
&amp; Support System@@ log ; has its own website to h@@ tt@@ p : / / ks@@ ystem log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softw@@ are@@ .@@ or@@ g. d@@ ort you will find further information about the supply range of &amp; ks@@ log .
&amp; boot log log ; find also in the following folder of the &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ Subversion Archive : ks@@ setup log ; in &amp; K@@ DE ; Archive
welcome to &amp; K@@ DE ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and in the following also named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section runs a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v .
the system V In@@ it evol@@ ved to the standard for checking the program starts when up@@ drive the system in the &amp; Linux ; world . therefore , because it is easier to use , more powerful and more flexible than the traditional BSD -@@ In@@ it .
I will not go on historical aspects ( e.g. because I know nothing about it : - ) .
the in@@ it @-@ binding file is therefore important under / s@@ am and not under / etc . this is therefore important because someone could try to make a machine on System V In@@ it without a re@@ install and new format . therefore , you need to make sure that the old In@@ it was removed from there where there was there one .
the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it also distingu@@ ishes itself from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ d. D@@ ort you will find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following further folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot scripts . basically , you need to start a script for any system service , which you want to run on another running level . system services include such things such as network , NFS , &amp; send@@ mail ; , h@@ tt@@ p@@ d &amp; etc . system services does not include such matters such as offset serial that is only once started . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should lie down below / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even if it does not have much use for it . you can also let down a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run something like high , what to do with the serial port .
the kernel is looking for different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first one finds it .
the standard Run@@ ning is entered in / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab . you should see the following line as the following :
on this point you can cast a look into the second column and probably determine that you can change the default Run@@ ning 3 . if you want to change anything , then you can manually repair any changes , then proceed to the system by rest@@ art the system and run the following :
but how does it start all the correct scripts ? if you set it in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you will see something like the following :
you will notice that there are no right files in this folder . instead , each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d .
how does it start and stop system services ? very simple : each of the scripts are written so that it does not accept a argument like start and stop . you can actually start this script in the command line as follows :
this would hold the h@@ tt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if the K does not include the script if it includes a S , the script will be called the script by the argument .
some people wish to set up a simple way to create machines for many purposes . I could run &amp; eg ; a server run@@ level , which can run only h@@ tt@@ p@@ d , &amp; send@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc . furthermore , I could also have a user Run@@ ning , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc .
here you can learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another poin@@ ter , it is simple to say tri@@ vi@@ al : just drag a entry from the price of your disposal system services to one of the six running levels to start at this level ( or stop it ) .
you can shift scripts or modify the position between Run@@ lev@@ eling or modify the position within one level by moving it . thereby , the entry of its original Run@@ ning ( or his position ) is removed only if they pull out a entry from the price of our dispos@@ ition services .
note : if you prefer to move them into a new area , you must select only from the menu , or from the context menu , and then insert it into the target zone -- even if the same entry exists in the target range of the promotion .
the sorting number of a entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such case you need to edit the sorting numbers in the ambient entries , before you can try to insert the system services .
note : there are no possibility to restore entries that have been thrown in the paper basket . be careful .
you can use the Tab@@ ulator button to activate the different working areas ( availability Systems , Run@@ ning 1 Start , Run@@ ning 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to meet a selection of upper or below the previous ones .
to move into another running level , move it with cut into the clip@@ board ( you can also use c@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and add it to the desired Run@@ ning with insert ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) .
to change sorting order number or the name of a entry manually , press the button to change the Properties dialog . connect the button to accept the dialog button in order to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to re@@ ject the changes .
because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the menu file will require a confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . def@@ aults to the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) are stored . otherwise , they are stored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; changes to the def@@ aults are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ r@@ c .
I tried to experiment with the standard Run@@ lev@@ eling , and now starts the machine constant . what can I do ?
at l@@ ilo -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in single @-@ use mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab and change the default value level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be in order ) .
I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for execution under Run@@ ning X , but they are not performed .
if you use &amp; SuSE ; or Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) , you must process additional files in / etc , which are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of the distribution .
the species , such as system services in these distri@@ butions , simpli@@ fies the configuration for the propri@@ etary plug@@ in programmes of this distri@@ butions , but unfortunately no standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you use a different distribution : check if all configuration files are available , which are required by the respective system service ( and also whether they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache res@@ p / h@@ tt@@ p@@ d ) do not end without the message if your configuration files are not available or false .
the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be of version differently . if you use a different distribution , please send me information on Run@@ ning , so this manual can be added to this manual .
this documentation is based on &amp; user ; 1.0 . with this program you can centrally manage the users and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; k@@ user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; user ;
once you have made changes , you have to save this . either use the corresponding symbol of the tool@@ bar or entry to the menu in the File menu .
&amp; user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two cart@@ il@@ cards , the user and the use session . to edit the desired user or the desired group with a double click on the entry . it appears the dialog or group properties .
some cardboard cards are only displayed if you have extended system settings . only if you have advanced system settings , if you are able to record individual settings , if shadow pass@@ words or such as / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as well as BSD / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d .
the ticket card password will appear if shadow pass@@ words or such as / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD -@@ Unix .
this ticket card appears only if you need to activate and initi@@ alize the file system ( Qu@@ ota ) file system ( recogni@@ z@@ able at the file quoted a.@@ user / quot@@ a group on the file system ) . here you can change parameters for each user parameters in KB :
these parameters can be adjusted individually for each file system . the current file system is selected by means of the field file system .
the ticket card groups informs about the group of the selected user . the standard group , to which the user belongs , can be found in the primary group . furthermore , the user can highlight the user into other groups by marking these in the large field .
the Group &apos;s Properties dialog contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group , mark this user in the list .
to add a user or a group , choose from the menu user or group or click the matching drive button of the tool bar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user or the selected group will be analogue .
using this module , you can add the l@@ ilo boat manager , remove the boat password , remove and change the time to boats of the standard operating system , remove the standard operation system , remove , change operating systems , change , change and more .
