<seg id="154">The separation of original and desktop simplifies the backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or derived image.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend to save the metadata option in the site of the metadata in & digial. if you forget this, you can then select the metadata from the database into the files by clicking the appropriate point in the menu album.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change? well, they are going to do with them a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are of course the most important.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now, the real work, since you should select any photo passwords, shriftings and an assessment. of course you can select the same attribute and set the value. this makes sense, since you can concentrate on the best photos.</seg>
<seg id="158">Try us now with keywords, keywords, such as you often have in other programs. all three are synonyms for the same matter.</seg>
<seg id="159">When you import Catalogative pictures from a different source with embedded sample words, then the images are attached to the right place. this sort of Hierarchy within the tree is no problem and can be easily done by drag a sub-tree to another. the changed words are done by & digious; updated while it is pursued by subtrees.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphics shows how different metadata over. this is a very rough representation, since each block of metadata consists in truth from many sections. file names and calendar data features properties of all pictures.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of keywords - the next section refers to shriftings or comments using the third important tool to catalogize your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You want to view most niemanden your photos just, you want to share them with your friends, your family, other photographers and agencies. they are sure interested in your photos.</seg>
<seg id="163">Look at this panorama. from the distance is not even a nice beach panorama. if you consider it closer, then start to see some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I tell you this of the landing area of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandy 60 years after landing. Wow, you might want to hear the silence, you can even hear the silence, so you can hear your perception of this panorama.</seg>
<seg id="165">For other photos consider the title may be more important than the image itself. if you are showing images, you should tell a story. remember, the key is to help us to understand the motive which you move, what you can understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is fine if a picture is not perfect when it has the strength only with a label for yourself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digiplug; you can also store a lot of text, in an internationalphabet (UTF-8), then you can export it for a selection of images. if you want to export your images in the label and / or the titles of the Web-Galeriessystem. you must tell the story so for the opening hours.</seg>
<seg id="168">Do you remember the times before GPS? when you had to find out another city without navigation system? was it not a boring planet before Google Earth? well, because with pictures, the train of the spatial presentation has already been with light speed.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities the geolocalization can be inseparable. I am sure that one day, in the future, you can repeat your journeys through images with geographical information. you can also export the pictures at the reception. you can also export the pictures at Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a vocabulary with copyright and signifies the practice of copyrights to remove restrictions on distribution and alteration of copies. the same freedoms are also valid in all changed versions, so also for the work of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description you will tell you what information in the installation page of the digiplug comes; as information should be deposited:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for inventors and author): this field should add your name, or the name of the photographer, for example, if it does not wish to change the name of the photographer, for example, if it does not wish to change the name of the photographer, it should not be changed. this field does not support clusters nor semi-partition.</seg>
<seg id="173">Car titles (synonym for the author): linked with the author. examples of this field contains the work name of the photographer, freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer. since this is a mermerk to the author, this must be also completed.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publisher (synonym for suppliers): do you use the clusion field to identify who this photo must be listed here. if the photographer can not necessarily be shown here. if the image is a storage photo here, the group / agency will find the picture here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections, although they have no protection against abuse. each of which is a little more than basic knowledge in work with calculator. this problem is for most of your photos only by low interest. for professionals and hold professionals, this protection is very important for professionals.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique in each image. & digiplug; there will be such a module for pile processing in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: panel error, turnouts, stream failure, ECC, transfer error, aging of storage media, restoration, redundancy, life time, temperature, data size, widespread abstitions</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course, we don't talk about CDs that have lost on the road or a fire. this kind of losses are the same that you can also happen in traditional paper photos or negatives. in this section, it is possible to solve problems with the so-called New Media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll Ontrack, the largest data manufacturer in the world, has some interesting statistics, which has a data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">In order to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs, you can do so much longer than a few years. of course you can claim your CDs and DVDs in archive quality. of course, you can claim your CDs and DVDs in archive quality. if you can claim a lifetime of 100 years for themselves, you can claim your life-life of 100 years for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD discs can be unreadable, but you can reduce this risk in which you can do good Disks and good recording devices. best DVD recording tools are not much more expensive than the cheapest, but you write much reliable. it's turn to the right.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very vulnerable for errors, even if you're just written. therefore, we use a control mechanism to protect themselves. 75% of the data are required for formatting and control. despite this massive protective words they are due to chemical ageing, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc.</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CDs and DVDs, it's a reasonable program called IsoBuster. it runs under Windows and & Linux; but is not yet available for Macs. there are also similar applications that damaged data from damaged disk images, hard disks, flash media, USB drives etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray Disks seem to save the format war against the HD DVD. a dual-layer Blu-ray disk can save 50 GB and thus says almost six times the capacity of a Dual-layer DVD with 8.5 GB. of course, it is also applicable for the Blu-ray disk.</seg>
<seg id="185">Check out slowly with a good recording range of high-quality media in a non-proprietary format. read the data again to check out a clean, dark dry and protected areas. do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media, or software that can read out these media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Disk manufacturers retain your statistics for itself. their manufacturers offer a new disk, but not the data. Google has a large field study on the errors of hard disks: disk missing</seg>
<seg id="187">Shortly: discos have the most frequent errors in the temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. with lower temperatures, SMART may not determine the fault errors. some of the SMART provides errors immediately. the expected lifetime of life is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is the complete losses due to overvoltage. of course, you can also have data loss due to a power failure before you have backed the files, but these losses can normally be changed without any large problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electrical devices should not make much account, these can take heavy damage in devices with computer chips and high-speed processes. these can cause severe damage, hardware-aging, implicate motherboards and other defects. do not use inevitable that lead to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">Most common protection against electricity points is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that absorbs a part of energy-heat and rest. it is normally available in the form of a plug-in connector. remember that every plug-in strip also contains a overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you're looking for an overvoltage protection, then you should pay attention to the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a particular minimum of protection. you should also make sure that it protects against flash stop and thereby protects the correctly connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">As a overvoltage can use each cable to your computer, you should make sure that all the peripherals can also be protected from your system. some manufacturers represent overvoltage controllers also include a telephone connection for your modem. others provide connection options for coaxial cable of cable modems and TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are developed specifically for notebooks, and therefore also contain the protection for the modem. so you are ideal for traveling.</seg>
<seg id="194">While a overvoltage protection your system will not be used before smaller variations in the supply lines, it will not really help you with a complete failure. even a failure of a few seconds can be able to give loss of irreplaceable data. it may therefore make sense to invest in a interruptible power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to the protection against overvoltages, these devices can be able to store the power failure. if you buy a USV, you should be sure that they will meet the same quality requirements such as an overvoltage protection. furthermore, the life time of the battery and the supplied software can be interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed and compare its safety with currents to avoid these. a high-quality overvoltage protection can be adjusted for less than & euro; 40. this is just a small price difference if you're thinking as well as your calculator. at the end, you should always think all cables before you go into the holiday.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web Service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - an easy storage service. with the correct configuration, you can use it as a drive under & Linux; Mac, and Windows. this allows you to store this as backup destination for your software. Google Shared storage is another popular offer with which you can save any quantity of data.</seg>
<seg id="198">However, they are at home very expensive in comparison to the hard drives, but $40 per year and / / dollar; 75 per year and 400 GB, you need to send the data about the comparatively slow internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore suitable for a solution against a local data loss of the most important images. it is not a bad solution, but it is not a common backup solution. therefore it is too slow.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Yahoo), Flickr (Yahoo) and the Photo Community 23hq.com make online storage services that have no longer available to photos, in case of Flickr dramatically. for $25 a year, you get unlimited memories, which should be reviewed only in reality.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the point of view of data backup, web solutions are very secure. transfer errors will automatically adjusted for the TCP protocol and the big companies are included in the offer a backup and a distributed memory. so they are desasterable.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in calculator. all transfers are susceptible to transfer errors. the file system needs and btrfs are at least the data integrity between the operating system and disk.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing about it is that nobody should happen if this happens in your hardware. all these disorders remain undiscovered until you don't find it. no one seems to have thought about it. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a significantly more secure data transfer than that of your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are a further source for transmission losses, as they generate interferences within the data stream. in normal file systems this error will be unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are currently not affected by transmissions problems, you should look into the future. in 2010, you will see thousands of errors per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS of Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two Candidates back to lower level. it is open source, with many patents and is available under one to GPL, compatible license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope for & Linux; and Windows available. read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has launched its own initiative with its btrfs file system. it is still in the Alpha status. it uses the same protection mechanisms that is used and is also available for & Linux; but it is not part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Not estimate that these two factors are responsible for 86% of the data losses related to notebook and 46% if notebooks now amounts to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less widespread than most franchisels. it is currently limited to a lower damage, such as thieves or new installations; Apple users know only very few viruses and under & Linux; it was already any longer sighted.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open Source file systems are less susceptible to data loss as proprietary systems: false, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFs, JFS and XFS file system. please find a very good English articles here.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss: wrong, only the speed of the investigation process during an eye is higher and an undefined status is avoided. if a file is not saved before the problem was lost, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the biggest threats for digital data: false, theft and human error are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Digital cameras are 1-2 aperture settings from fundamental physical boundaries. that is, while the technology is further developed, there is a natural limit for these progress. sensitivity and smoky plastics are not far away from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras continue in direction of 10 megapixelsensors. even though this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and the end result is optimized for compact cameras. even DSLR cameras have their limit at 10-12 megapixels. for higher resolutions, you need a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or greater formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">A 750GB hard drive today will receive you for 100 & euro; so you do not have any data loss affected by any data loss. so secure your data on a plan and test this backup before you make something similar as the reinstall of your operating system, replacing the exchange of disks or the size of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you take daily your securities on an external SATA drive. if, then one day, a flash, you're lucky when the drive was not connected in the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster hit locally and destroys a lot. forget aircraft accident: fire, water, electricity, children and thieves are dangerous enough for your data. they usually affect a whole room or entire house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore Desasterance is always a non-local storage. bring your fuses up the stairs into the neighboring house, into your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of the physical isolation: as above already said is a common cause for a data loss in spite of the panic. if you have a backup that is not available immediately, then you can save one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all the files should be backed up. it is a snapshot without histories and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differential backup: the backup of the files have been changed since the last complete backup. generates a complete snapshot at two time points: the complete backup and the last differential pressure.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: one backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup. you can restore the original status at any time. this backup is on the next to the next with the exception that it is only getaway and not continued.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful small tool that can easily be set up easily on your machines. in contrast to script file sharing or other types of file transmissions copies rsync only the difference of files that were really changed. this happens if you want to increase security over ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Secure important images directly after you store them on your computer on a DVD or another optical medium.</seg>
<seg id="225">This approach takes you enough time to detect losses and restore. at the same time you get a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly basis for at least one month and a moment update for every month. every additional dilution should be done manually after which you made a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata, stored in the image file stored IPTC, associated XMP files, original store, storage, scalability, media, editing images and metadata, copy of images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, vision devices,..., usage of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">Thus valuable pictures will survive the next 40 years that time, about the period in which you really interested in you, because they remember your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">Since the future is foreseeable because of nature is unpredictable, everything is said today. unfortunately, there is no other way to evaluate the current system backward. if less variants are used in the past, it is easier to evaluate the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document. use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is now available for everyone. if you have an old system that is important for reading your pictures, then keep it on and install it in a virtual machine for a later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand the Council is quite easy: definitely if you want to change your computer architecture, your memory and security technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary to convert any newer standard. stay in open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the expert pressure to change a system in its size. this means it actually increase.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's go from that you have the scalability with implant and put the area you want to enlarge it on a dedicated plate or partition. at * nix systems such as & Linux; can copy it and store them on a new record:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the command dmesg, whether your new record is detected by the system, but do not hang it.</seg>
<seg id="235">/ dev / SDC # Source can / dev / SDC # Source is / dev / SDC # Source, the new record is / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; size of the plate in MBens; # works with ext2,3, FAT16, 32 and reisfs & dollar change; resice2fs / dev / SM # 1 # change the size of reisfs if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open Source Standards have the great advantage of an open specification. even when a day no software can read it, then you can create this yourself. this task will be easier by year to year easier.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format which disappears slowly from the market. you should therefore not use it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG was developed as an open source standard, however. it can save much more. it is loss-free, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, but not as many as TIFF needed and a slow compression technique. this format will we recommend you to store your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widely distributed as image format. I can store images in uncompressed form or stored in a container with a lossless compression algorithm. a problem is however to store your pictures in this format. there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG, the Digital Negative file format is a license-free and open crude format developed by Adobe Systems. DNG has been developed for using metadata. a handful camera vendor is now available and we hope to use the competitors' Canon and Nikon.</seg>
<seg id="241">This is probably one of the reasons why, around 2001, Adobe has introduced its XML based XMP technology to make the & quot; Extensible Metadata Platformquot; provides a mixture of XML and RDF. it is a key marking which users are allowed to enter into a file itself. the file information is stored for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers go ahead of the original of your recording, mostly archived in the raw format, but it can occur separately from the image file. so it can't notice the raw format. therefore, you should put them on whether you use DNG to use the container and put everything there together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards, supporting a wide range of uses and modelling, discussions and community work in the DCMI communities, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and transfigured efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import pictures from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. so long the pictures on the camera are, you can use this as temporary fuse.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and store this in your tube archive. this function is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a hostile processing you can use external programs. if you come back to & digiplug; then you should add the metadata again. these were cut off the metadata under circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the machined pictures for the copyright with a digital watermark. export it then in web galleries, encode to MPEG, use in contact page, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digi.In the section adding a photos to you. in the section you can add a description as you can already add on your hard disk. but the camera interface offers you many advanced settings for importing images to your Albendatenbank.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera & digiplug; connect this with the computer, switch the camera on the display mode and switch them. a further description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When you start the camera interface, the camera tries to connect to your camera. if the connection is made, the filename is displayed on the lower end and the pictures will be shown. if this is the case, the filename is displayed and a symbol for file assignment for any file, photos, movies, music, etc.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you can download the photos on your computer, you may need to view the camera information on each entry. using the lateral handles and metadata from the camera interface, you can see the characteristics of a entry or his metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog features filtering characteristics and photo information that can be saved internally of the camera. a symbol indicates that the picture has not been downloaded on your computer. note that for some digital cameras not all available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The rider metadata shows the internal metadata such as EXIF, manufacturer's instructions, GPS etc. of the picture. these information are the same as in the metadata sidebar in the main window of & digial; or the picture processing. please note that these metadata is not available on some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer, click on the button and then you will download all photos from their camera to a single album in & digi.. when you downloaded the photos safe in an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you do not want to download all photos, you can only select the desired destination options of & KDE. once you select the photos, use the button. download the button. download the button, until you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">When your camera supports this, an option New download is available. these pictures have now been downloaded from & digi. here. in this case, the new images are marked with a star in the window window. if you select this option, you will be downloaded only the new pictures.</seg>
<seg id="257">When you can download the buttons All download or Selected combination, a dialog appears to select the target album, where you can read the target album, in which the photos can be found in section My albums, and then select the target album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After you have selected the target album, press OK, and & digiplug; download the photos from the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">As soon as you have downloaded the required photos, you can delete them from the camera. you can delete all of the camera by delete the button. if you only want to delete everything, you must first choose to delete this first and choose Delete.</seg>
<seg id="260">Note that there are no opportunity to recover from the camera that you will be deleted from the camera. you should not be deleted from the camera. if you want to delete the camera, you should make this camera over the camera, because it's much faster than the camera.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras are often used as filenames for the photos often. the filenames are often utilized, after taking photos from the camera. this may be useful to integrate photos from different recording criteria. therefore it can be useful to integrate the date and time to integrate the filename in the filename.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section you will find options for turning and mirrors on the picture and for the date, if you use this latter option, automatically create a folder per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options During the transmission will open three more options to be performed before the photos on the panel are stored on the panel. if you want to select the corresponding entries from the EXIF data into the IPTC fields. with the last option, you can correct date & time for any downloaded pictures.</seg>
<seg id="264">If you wish to use a different file format than the standard format, you can use the prefix Photo -% Y-% m-% H:% M. use the option date & time. for more adjustments, you should read the help of command-time.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the option camera filename, you have the possibility to change the filename in lowercase. or in uppercase, if you prefer this.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new filename, the & digiplug; used for a photo is displayed below the name that the camera will be available in preview. your settings for renaming are saved and automatically used when you open the camera window.</seg>
<seg id="267">And digiplug; may use all information about the orientation of camera to time recording, to do not all cameras set this information. in section sidebar metadata, you can read further details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic rotation is normally switched on, and if your camera will not supply these information, & digiplug; the photo in the original orientation. if you turn off automatically turn off, use the knob and select the Automatic rotation in the lower part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera has been made information about the date you have made & digi.This subspecies are based on image data. all pictures with the same date are uploaded to the same sub-album. in section sidebar meta data you can read what information your camera may have embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is normally off, and in this case & digiplug. if you want to change this option, use this option. if you want to change this option, use the button on the lower end of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to upload photos from your computer to your camera is the button. choose the file selection dialog & KDE, where you can select the files uploaded. you can also select more than a file with the standard & KDE; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the image selection is done, asks & digiplug. you can whither the pictures will be loaded too. select the folder selection dialog. select the folder and press OK to start the upload. the pictures will not be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is a general term used in this document. this is a position that can be displayed on a map and can be displayed on a map. the identification of the data can be performed by American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European Galileo or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographers, it can be interesting to link a picture of precise geographic place. non-use, an area can use an area through automatic recording of GPS data. environmental planner, military, police, architectural office and property interests can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you've forgotten later, where the photo was made, you can open a browser that shows the area. if you want to register a postcard to another & digious; users will send you to the location of the photos, or simply to document this aspect, it is good to record the position data of a photos.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is how to get the GPS data into the image? first, you should know that exiv2 are many GPS data fields, such as direction, saddle and map files. directly with the correct hardware, via a reworking of the GPS data and image files with the KIPI module to the geographical mapping (manual) and last about the manual input of known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know there is currently no camera that has a GPS unit, but there is a few who work with GPS receivers together. either as a card module or through transmission of the data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with gpsman or gpp. you need to save this data in GPX format, because this is the only format that is supported by the module to geographical mapping.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are various programs for & Windows; and Mac OS that extracts the data of pictures and from the GPS. on the following page you can extract the same under & Linux;: gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the length and latitudinal and other data, then you can use this script that works with the exifted tool by Phil Harvey. it uses the sign-based coordinates, such as maps.google.</seg>

<seg id="297">With setting PNG compressing, you can reduce the size of PNG-files. this operation reduces the image data, because PNG use a lossless algorithm. if you set a fast computer, you can set this value to a high compression. thus, 1: a low and 9 is a high compression rate.</seg>
<seg id="298">Using the TIFF-files, you can compress the deflate file algorithm for TIFF images. this reduces the size of the TIFF-images. it has no influence on the image quality, because the deciphate algorithm is loss-free.</seg>

<seg id="303">This setting is only used when the white off is not set. standard is a fixed color balance that was photographed on a white map that was photographed in the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is supported only for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. the use of the second sensors has the effect that underexposed photos in four steps more details in the top-top. for other cameras this option gets ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The standard is the top-top, so the parts of your images are reflected as piercing white with the impotency of your camera. at least do you use the brighter in various rosette. lastly, you can try to reconstruct some parts of missing information from top-tops.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels generally do not satisfy as fast as green and red. & digiplug. and dcraw try to reconstruct the lack of green and red sharks from the still not saturated blue pixels. of course, this is a question, how much color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you select the option, you get the possibility to set up a level. here is a value of three a compromise and can therefore be adjusted individually for any image.</seg>
<seg id="308">Put the Luminance value to your taste. you must probably make it slightly higher than the standard 1. this can also be made later in the image options of & digiplug; to hold the time for the icing icing, you should be able to be conservative.</seg>

<seg id="339">A status line at the bottom edge of the window, the filename, current filename, magnification factor, and the current image size.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top edge and including the toolbar for quick access to the most common functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The processing functions of image editing change your photos. however, the original photo will be changed, before you use File Save or button Save out of the toolbar. note that you can't recover the original photo - as soon as you have saved the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">You should evoke a copy of your image before you change it. you can save it with file Save as if possible.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can restore the original screen by reproduce the image editing pane in the toolbar. you then lose any change that you have been carried out in the photo since the last store.</seg>
<seg id="344">Nearly every action of image processing can be recalled or recovered. the last promotion can revoke you by editing or recovered from the menu by editing the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you're using this, you should make the shortcut short, Ctrl; -z to reproduce and remove Ctrl; -Shift Z to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you select the & LMB; you can switch off the backdrop or restore button in the toolbar for a moment, you will receive a context menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all promotions are also reproduced or recovered.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you started the picture processing, you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by clicking the navigation buttons in the toolbar, image, rath or the entries in the menu file. if you have any changes to the current photo, you will be asked if you want to save this.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can fall in the photo and check out in which you use Ctrl; mouse wheel or symbols in the toolbar or the entries in the safest menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To customize a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: select a magnification factor</seg>
<seg id="350">View Full Screen Mode display the photo in full screen mode. if you do not wish to use the tool bar in which you can't like this. if you do not want this, you can retrieve it from the & digis; main window. see the section to set the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current picture you can print in the menu image below and get the default & KDE, printer dialog. you can customize the settings before you can print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu, you can print individual images or whole sentences. all the images can choose from your choice. you only need to select the pictures with the default methods and follow the menu album Export Pressure assistent. if you follow the assistant, you just need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The & digious window appeared; the window has a side bar at the right edge, which provides important information and actions for the selected images. the same sidebar is available without navigation use. it is displayed if one of the five riders is clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple Click on the same rider, the sidebar will appear and disappear again in the rim.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the vent view, you can enter shrifton with unlimited size or insert. the text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters can be copied to EXIF- and IPTC- Fields, so that you can use other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data are only limited to ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are cut off after 2000 characters. if you want to use the IPTC labelling field in other applications, you should be considered to be observed.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you commented on, use either the button or switch to the next image, which will then be stored.</seg>
<seg id="358">Besides the user button there is a button More. with this you can read further metadata from the selected file or database. however, this is always carried out if you have selected a metadata setting, which is always written in the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="359">The section rating shows an assessment scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in searching and sorting areas. it can always be used to evaluate several images at the same time. in order to evaluate several images at the same time, select this out and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The evaluation is written in the IPTC field. the coding follows the scheme in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The search view shows a search box for filtering the passwords, the sampling and a selection box with previously mentioned in this & digious words; session requested stitches.</seg>
<seg id="362">The sampling system is adjusted according to the specified search phrase. you can quickly restrict the number of possibilities in search of a keyword. this ability is especially useful if you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the lower end is a further relief during the input of keywords with a picture series. if you have entered different keywords, they are saved for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set by marker the respective check boxes in the tree. all keywords are saved in the IPTC field keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If several pictures are selected in the main screen and select a keyword in the sample tree, this will only be applied to the entire selection, if you want a selection with a keyword, please read the sampling filter section.</seg>
<seg id="366">The sampling filter is used to alter the selection of images shown in the main window. usually, the left side bar is used with their album, - data, search, search and search results. if additionally, one or more sampling filters will be used. all created passwords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also drag and drop them. if the keyword is already exists, you can simply drag and set aside. if the keyword is already exists, you can simply drag and set aside. if the keyword is already exists, you can simply move it out of the right sidebar. then a dialog appears that you want to set the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example shows the images on one calendar day. the sample filters will be reduced to three pictures. they have been selected with Strg + a and later it was put off. a dialog asks if this keyword is to be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes takes place at any start of the program. it can also be used without any settings.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created and notice that it should be one or its, you can easily change this easily with a double click on the text and in the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry to which in the database is sought. this may be an album, name, keyword, image, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator, which is a name or a string that is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can define a Extended search for all the elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to grouped options, you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule, and then use the button. the options then look as follows:</seg>

<seg id="377">The reason why you set a colorized workflow. with a colorable workflow, you can achieve that the colors on your monitor can be found on your monitor or scanner same and the colors printed you or on the web, which correspond to them from your digital dark chamber.</seg>
<seg id="378">If the theme is coming on color management, everyone wants to press what buttons are to press for the results which he would like to give you an adequate background information about color administration. additionally, you should make links with deeper information enable your own informal decisions to make your desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image workflows fulfilled all the criteria specified at the bottom, you do not need to worry about color management.</seg>
<seg id="380">They are calibrated on a monitor that can be calibrated on the sRGB colour space. (please find further information below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other image expenditures are via e-mail or web, where sRGB of de-facto standard is.</seg>
<seg id="382">So, if sRGB doing so well and the life for all so easy, why should one use another colour space and therefore need to make thoughts about color blossoms?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of sRGB in comparison to the colors we can really see below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors which we can see is the huurous region, and the colors in the RGB colour space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some larger farms, see Bruce Lindbloom page and then click information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to watch my monitor, if I have decided to work only in the RGB color space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! if you are working in the sRGB color space, or do not you need to create your monitor. when you have RGB at sRGB, then you need to use their monitor at sRGB, then you need to use either your monitor on the sRGB standard, a matching monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections to improve the image in most cases. use it therefore before you try to try a further manual processing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions normalization, the same, automatic sealing and contrast extend from the menu, automatically try to make the best automatically out of your colors. you will have to experiment with these effects, to see what is best in your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scaled against the whole image, so that the dark point black and the brightest point so bright as possible without any color orientation. this function is often a magnetic correction for pictures of dark or balanced.</seg>
<seg id="391">The same method adjusts the luminosity of the colors of the selected image, so that the histogram of the intensity is so flat as possible. thereby, the same very good results in improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it produces even rubbish. it is a very powerful operation that causes either miracles by a picture or it was destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automated driving: this method maximizes the color range in red, green and blue channel. it determines the dark and bright border shades and adjusts the red, green and blue channels on the entire histogrammatical range.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast extends: this method improves the contrast and luminosity of the RGB values of a picture through the highest possible area and a new jireation of all values between. this is only visible at balanced images and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white-cut off & digiplug; is a semi-automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photos.</seg>
<seg id="395">The bald correction is a bit limited because of a colour space with 8-bit per color. if you are going to be far away from the original screen, if you can perform white balancing in the raw mode, which will perform in 16-bit mode, so your possibilities will improve for correction better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a tinent algorithm that is protected by copyright of Pawel T. Jochora. it will start on the menu entry colours white abnormalization of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The front window can be adjusted in size. on the left side, both the original image is adapted to the preview of the tool. if you want to see the original whitish immediately, it is enough to click the lower window.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target photos has a red marker. the luminance of the Pixels under this marker is indicated as vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">On the right above, a histogram, so soon as you change a parameter, the histogram is very helpful, most pixels very small Luminance values. with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum will appear. the sum will be called Luminance.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shadows, saturation and gamma. the shadows allows you to improve the shuttings of your photos or even down.</seg>
<seg id="401">Anstat with the above inspections, you should use the colour temperature pipette. press on this button and then anywhere in the preview for calculating the colour temperature of the white balance. on this type, the temperature and green values are automatically set.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can reset the white balance with the list of default settings. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The coatings-dictator increases the colors when more than a color channel of the Pixels is exposed.. you will get the combined result in a white indicator. this is shown in preview of a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">Buttons Save as and load exactly that. each attitude of the white-equivalent you can set you in a text file and reload later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The button defaults defaults to their standard values and the corresponding neutral white-balance. note that the neutral settings will be shown another photo than your original. if you save them, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can adjust the plates per color channel of the processed image. 8-bit encoding is far better suited to high quality images. this coding is better suited for high quality images. this coding is also only available for high quality images, and stands only for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF, and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool gives the same dialog such as the processing of images. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. color mapping can be carried out by the subwindow for the use of colour profiles. a detailed guidance for the use of colour profiles can withdraw the text colour management.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is available in the menu under the same color correction. this tool provides an integrated way to set up several color channels simultaneously, so you can always make the same mistakes and you always need the same correction. in the manual to the sound correction, you will find more information.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful possibility of exposure to correct is the tool for gradation that you can find under gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The & digiplug; tool colour effects depicts four colour effects, a solar effect effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and an edge filter available.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of the chemical processing, Solarisation, also called Sabatier, was a effect of the additional light. this result was the effect that the brighter areas darker and the colors were inverted by the second lighting. the result was a part negative of the picture. this tool allows you to fine this interesting effect fine.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar panels. at approx. 50% intensity, the image shows what chemical is possible. another increase is finally a negative picture that is not so on photo paper.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar output effect. the original image is the (1) and the technique (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filters simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it distinguishes itself from a saturation that he makes a stronger contrasting effect given the colours and makes it easy, he embellished many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for a transparent color film produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm; the name is a composition of & quot; Velvias many saturated colours and high contrast, but also some photographers, especially those of which are hardly noticeable, too much.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neon filter simulates neonlight on the contrast-edges. the parameter level controls the brightness of the neonlight. at large images, the filter can grope the whole CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it's not unusually that you want to correct the colour contrast and the luminosity of the photos in the menu. all your alignment can be found in preview. once you are satisfied with the result, use the button Ok and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you make a photo of bad lighting conditions, you can reduce the converted problem: one to large saturation. also in this case, the tool is able to reduce saturation. all modifications can be seen in preview. if they do the result, you can confirm the changes to Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool gradation and the simple leuktensile strength / contrast / Gamma is set the tool to improve exposure. even if the dialog for this tool is very complicated, you need for the application of the slider. concrete the three shooting down below the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of intensity values, an histogram, the active canals or the selected area. under the graph, three sliders can be mounted into the image and the left side represents the dark and right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn the control is to shift the knob and to mind how the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right side can be viewed the original and preview of the picture. the preview will be dynamic, using the settings of the picture, updated. on the left, the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selection box can be adjusted if the histogram with a linear or logarithmic Y axis is frequently represented. in pictures the large areas of a constant colour is dominated by a single column. in this case, the logarithmic classification is useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three controllers: the top for the dark tones, the middle for the bright tones and the bottom for the medium sounds frequently called Gammac.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three color-pinching can be used in preview of the original image to automatically adjust the inputs of the shade, medium and bright tones automatically. furthermore there is a button for a fully automatic alignment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output: the output value allows you to select a selection of manual values for each area. there are also two switches that can be used to evaluate the output rate. for example, the compression of the output file can be used e.g. to create something different in the background during something different.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this knob the image values will be automatically set in dependence on the image values.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and load: with these buttons, the set values can be stored in the file system and then loaded again. Gimp levels is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three paint sprayers, the inputs will automatically be adjusted automatically for all shadows, means and solar tones, and click the preview of the original image for rotational, green, blue, blue and Luminous channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The option of overexposure dictator controls all color channels to view overexposed pixel and to give you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it's no effect on the final results.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below is an example of the alignment of the inputs applied to red, green and blue channel of a photos. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output effects remain unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the correct picture (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left side, half of the original and the target picture is displayed, dynamically updated depending on your settings. the following options are available on the right side:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modification channel: this selection box allows the channel to be changed from the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">Apart from that box there are two symbols between a linear and logarithmapped view. for images that have been recorded with a wide digital camera, linear mode produces a wide beam in linear mode. in this case, logarithmic mode helps in this case.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move to the right, e.g. the bright sounds, then you can see that these bright sounds can be correspondent and corresponding to the associated image pixels.</seg>
<seg id="436">On the preview of the original photos is a red mark to see. if you want to change this mark in the range you want to change the original value. create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and load: with these buttons you can do exactly this. every curve you can have created in the file system and then loaded, the file format is the Gimp curve format.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you create this method and the three paint sprayers, you automatically want to use the control points of the curve for all channels of the shade-, medium and solar tones. check the original image to set the control points for the red, green, blue and luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The option of overexposure dictator controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels. in more than a channel overloaded pixels, you get the combined result. this is an indicator that you can view the effect only in preview and it's no effect on the final results.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black-and-white photo that was corrected in the Luminous channel. shade- and sunflower tones was applied with the epipette and applied to the curves. the original image is (1) and the correct (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The Channel Mixer of & digiplug; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the shades of the photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is a further developed tool for mixing the shades of the images. you can process it from the menu-channel mixer image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel selection box, select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first note as you can correct the channels by showing the relative distribution and rash. the left section of the window displays a preview. the original can be viewed by comparison over the own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red marker. if you set this in the image, a vertical line in the histogram to display the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">The controls for the module are right down: knob for red, green and construction allows you to activate these channels. if you also use this option of Monochrome, as the Channel Mixer is able to produce a great black-and-white conversions of your photos. try the green channel for black-and-white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix monochrome, leads the reduction of a colour to a visible noise that occur from farbrauschen. when this is the case, you can improve your monochrome conversion through which you first reduce the colourless.</seg>
<seg id="447">The Save as and store buttons are used exactly to this purpose. any mixer setting allows you to save and then load. the used file format is the Gimp channel audio format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The option of overexposure dictator controls all color channels to view overexposed pixel and to give you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it's no effect on the final results.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a photo in which the blue channel was re-adjusted. the option Luminance is enabled. the original image is listed below (1) and the illustrated picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography was always fascinating because of your offence. with the development of digital photography is black / white a work step because paint images can be easily converted on the computer. also with a set of film rolls profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white background exposure using a green lens filter. this looks good for all scenarios and fits especially well to portraits against the sky. so similar to 004 Cokin (TM) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orantes: simulates a black / white background exposure using an orange lens filter. this improves landscapes, marine scenes and aerial photos. so similar to 002 Cokin (TM) Orantes.</seg>
<seg id="454">Rotates: simulates a black / white background exposure with a red lens filter. this creates a dramatic high-level effects and can simulate lunar-balance to the daily time. so similar to 003 Cokin (TM) rotates.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white background exposure with an yellow lens filter. this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 Cokin (TM) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Seposon: generates warm bright and medium shades while adding a bit coldness in the shear. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and that similar to the 005 Cokin (TM) Sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">Using the digiplug; tool texture, you can apply decorative textures to a picture.</seg>
<seg id="458">Adding a texture to your picture, regardless of whether it is a color picture or not, you can look like a wall painting on a screen, the sticker of an old master, a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a wall picture at a wall. the menu entry picture texture can be used for it.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: postpone this parameter to the right the depth of the depth and three-dimensional texture.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper textual effect is applied on the picture below. the original image is (1) and the modified (2). the relief is set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">The & digiplug; tool frame can be added to a decorative frame to be added a picture.</seg>
<seg id="462">The eye of an considerations in the limits of a photos is no easy task. to maintain its attention. this is a psychological barrier for scattering eye. under the frame, the module can be started from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter you set the desired frame type for your image. through a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black and white images), it cuts a decorative frame with a nice three-dimensional frame and decoratively adds a decorative frame with pattern.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: specifies the frame width in percent. the value range for the width is limited from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">That with the frame of decorated target image will be bigger than the original but the same aspect ratio. this is important for the printing of images, especially if you have used the tool in case of aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this practical tool, you can insert simple-format text in any image on any part. it also goes on several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply type the text and place it with the mouse. do you use text size, the larger must be the character set. at the end, simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi-transparent background. finally, the picture is finished.</seg>
<seg id="468">Each setting, which you have chosen for your text can be changed until you have been changed to "OK" button. after the image has been saved once, the text part of the image is changed. it cannot be changed.</seg>
<seg id="469">With the digiplug; tool template apply you can put a template over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The Menu Photo Template Apply into image processing can be used to put templates over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For templates, there are no restrictions concerning the size and orientation. you need to add the PNG file format and should you want to add your template's file size, so you just send an e-mail in English to & digi.mailinglist digire-users @ kde.org..</seg>
<seg id="472">If you are using this tool for first time you need to put your stencil folder with the button base folder in dialog. select the folder where you will be copied to the folder. these settings will be noted for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder for the template has been made a building that reflects the folder of the stencil printer. the selection of a folder will be updated automatically.</seg>
<seg id="474">Below the preview you can find three buttons with which you can change the magnifying factor and position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this knob increases the darlying image. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Smaller: this knob resized this button. in order to adjust the position of the mouse. if you want to adjust the template onto the whole image, you need to scroll the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move them: use this button to move the image below the template. take the image and place it on the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK if you want to apply the template onto your picture. the image will then be adjusted automatically.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digicame; provides three different tools for sharpening. each of you have benefits in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but especially in dark areas, grained pictures.</seg>
<seg id="481">Filming mask will look at the contrast of the edges in order to look sharp. it's really sharply, it works rather psychovisual. you can use it just a really good job. the algorithm was taken out of Gimp and it is protected by copyright of Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">It is possibly the best of the three, since it really improved the sharpness. it is a bit more complicated in its application and has various parameters to adapt.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus, most digitalised images need a correction of the sharpness. this means that the digitization process paints can be printed along with just minimum differences when colour highlights are printed on paper. SLR cameras usually require better known as normal cameras for the home user.</seg>
<seg id="484">JPEG pictures, JPEG pictures, a camera frequently has been applied for internal carbide images. images in the shell format are always enabled to be tightened in the processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some ads have a sharpening filter already during the reading of the picture. if you disable this disable, you get control of your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations, you can get usable results by sharpening a photo with the sharpening mode. you can correct the menu entry.</seg>
<seg id="487">You should be careful not to handle the sharpness of the edges, but amplifies the sharpness of the edges, but amplifies the sharpness of the image. in general, you will find further information on the menu entry. you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too tight. the solution to correct it is much easier than it. using the menu entry, and experiment the tool on the right side of the dialog box showing the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter unsharp is a very good tool to remove muzzle from your photos. you can see this demonstration here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview can help edit the image. the showcase shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often produce good results and should first test the effect. if you create the sharpened mask, are smoked and the impression of grass in the vicinity of sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius represents a lot of pixels on each side of a edge by the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radii. you should therefore sharpened images best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the wiped image which is added to the original. thus, the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The swelling value is a fraction from the maximum RGB value and the difference of the filters. this way, areas with a soft change between killing of sharpenes and therefore beauty faults are avoided in faces, Himmler and water surface.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the unsharp overturned filter. the original image is the (1) and the modified image (2). unsharp mask was applied with a radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digiplug; tool will focus on a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyright protected unfolding filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries an image to & quot; refocal frequency. this is better to try the photo. it uses a technology called FIR Viennese film. it is used to use a technology called FIR Viennese film. it can only use better results than blurred masks. you can start it from the menu by using colors Refok.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circular flow is much better than the Gauge's split into a very long tail, which leads far from the original pixel pixels, which is far influenced by far from the original size pixel. most cases even highly strongly influenced by remote pixels. this causes undesirable results.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular flow rate: this is the most important parameters for the use of this module. for most of the images, the default value should be 1 good results. you can set a higher value when your image is very unsharp, but then on the sanctuary.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: the correlation can help reduce artefacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. the correlation is 0.5 and the values close to 1, & eg; 0,95 and 0,99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpest effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Rauschfilter: an increase in the filter filter can help you reduce artefacts. however, values higher than 0,1 can be very rare. if the noise filter is too low, & eg; 0 the image quality is very poor. a good value is 0,03. a high value is still to contamination.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauge's sharpness: this is the radius for the Gauge's sharpness. in most cases, you should use this value to 0 to avoid annoying artefacts. if you use a value equal to zero, you may also increase the correlation and / odery noise filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrizensize: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. however, if you choose large numbers for circular sharpness or the Gauge's sharpness. note the module is very slow when you choose large values for this parameter. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The Save as and store buttons are used exactly to this purpose. any random parameters will set you that will be saved later and then can be loaded then.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to execute all trimmings, color and intensity corrections on the picture before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module before you change the image. the reason for this is that much operations are not visible immediately, but later unpleasant artefacts leave.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you read and compress images, & eg; than JPEG, you should apply the module to uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, unsharp masks produces better results as sharpening. this could be caused by unsharp masks using a bigger neighborhood as sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically, unsharp masks must always generate artefacts. even under optimum conditions it can never indicate the effect of the FIR Vienna Filters always at least as good as the blends mask. the FIR Vienna filter is frequently better in processing of small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below, you can see a comparison between different filters, on a little undisputed picture:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp color image has to be corrected. this image has been taken with an analogous camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the car focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information about the methodology of sharpenance in digital images, you can read a technical comparison in English under this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The knob and the sharpness of the darkeness has been darkened to generate a natural pair of Pupille.</seg>
<seg id="514">The color tinned allows the adapted colour for the pupil. if you want blue eyes rather than dark, then you can adjust this here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool-error correction is one of the most sophisticated tool developed in order to remove undesired artifacts with unparalleloser speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">Involalgorithm was developed by the IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS Labors in Caen / France and is part of the CImg-Project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool includes various default settings as a starting point to simplify the restoration. the available settings are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings, you can use the rider Glance and Advanced Settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detail conservation [0, 100]: this controls the conservation of details. a small value leads to a smooth glass of smooth regions and details are sharp. a value of 0.9 should be found so that no sharpening should be necessary. please refer to the detailed description of the direction of movement.</seg>
<seg id="520">Direction buffer alpha [0,100]: a small value smoother evenly into all directions while a value is close to 1 only in one direction. JPEG artefacts will produce a very high value of similar design. JPEG artefacts will be best eliminated at a value of 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smoothing [0, 500]: this sets the maximum glass factor above alles. p then defines the relative smoothing. set this value therefore suitable to the degree of smoke in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter concerns greater structures. the higher this value is necessary if it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh' Turbulence effect, it must be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: specifies how often the algorithm is gone through. usually goes 1 or 2.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angle step width [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of the anisotropic Alpha. if alpha is small chosen, it should also be small to generate a long runtime. you should choose to achieve this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integrale stride length [0,1, 10]: integrable stride length in pixels. you should avoid the value smaller than 1 to avoid sub-pixels and never greater than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear interpolation use: the more of the quality you can receive by selecting this option is low. it doubles the running time. we recommend it to allow him.</seg>
<seg id="527">The buttons Save as and load exactly that. any adjustment of image error can be corrected in a text file and then re-loaded.</seg>
<seg id="528">Image error correction is comparatively very quick at work. however, it can still last very long and take a high CPU load. you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the knob.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below, you can see how image error was removed with small artifacts. the module is used on a photo that in Guatemala City was created with an analog camera. the original image is shown below (1) and the original image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digiplug; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce image noise. it uses a protected algorithm from Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool is available to selectable image filters, to remove stains and other artefacts which can be removed from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or moorusd; effects of fed images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information about sensors of digital cameras, you can read this tutorial in English at this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene that was made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows an grained noise that can be removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases you need only the subwindow details and the bottom-window settings can remain in default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius is controlled the window size, of 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter. large numbers increase the time specified by the radius. the image indicated below the picture and the color in it is smoothed and therefore smaller flaws were adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: adjusts the sharpness of the filters after the front view of the filters. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter details does not receive any more and noise and robbery occurs again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it can be too strong, can't occur at the maximum, if you want to remove a weak or JPEG artefacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance of the image. we recommend either color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings are not impact the smoother process of the image.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend either color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings are not impact the smoother process of the image.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gammatolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance levels of the darker zones that typically are stronger than increase, but he does also dirty the shadeareas.</seg>
<seg id="541">Cushioning: controls the alignment of Phasenjitterdamping. this value defines as quickly the adaptive filter radius on variations of the luminance. when he is on his minimum, noise and phasenjitter may occur at the edges. it can remove smoke peaks and is the recommended method for this.</seg>
<seg id="542">Save and store: these buttons are used exactly to this. all parameters for boilers that you have set can be saved to the file system and then loaded.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how smoke production can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the resulting production was applied to the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too tight for your purpose. the solution that make a bit soft than a picture to test, and experimenting with the menu entry, and experiment with the menu entry to the right side of the dialog box showing the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digis came; photo Restauration is definitely one of the most sophisticated tools in the widest developed tools.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for the restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artifacts, film grains, scratches, scratches, scratches, cratch, compression artefacts and local mistakes occurs in digital, original or later digitized images and receives the content as it also makes the human eye.</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for paint and texturing. the texturing is done with another tool, the error correction was developed by the IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS Lab in Caen / Franné. it is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG Artefacts reduce: compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far away. as a lossless compression algorithm created some compression & quot; Artefacts & quot; Artefacts & quot; - small standards that are visible in uncompressed image. this setting should be correct.</seg>
<seg id="549">The buttons saved as and load this. each setting of photo restauration can be saved in a text file and will be loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo-Restauration is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can still last long and take a high CPU load. you can therefore stop the calculation at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below, the module can be restored as a photo with equilical noise. the module is applied to a black and white photo that was detected on a Ilford (TM) HP-5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the notorious film grading of the faces. the original image is below (1) and the correct tab (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below, you can see another example of the photo restoration. this time, textures can be found on an old colour photo that was shown with a scanner. you can see the scan artifacts and the photo paper. the original image is shown below (1) and the correct image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The & digiplug; tool Hotpixel allows you to remove hotpixel of photos that have been removed with a CCD camera. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project that are protected by law by Martin Dickp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, tote or hot pixels are particularly important to high quality raw materials photos, as many cameras with JPEG compression have a built-in oppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot pixels; and "quot; bright pixels; on a photo with a dark image subtracting method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file in the wizard with the button dark image. the tool will automatically identify the hot and bright pixels. these are highlighted in the image detail.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera, it's important to take the dark image directly in the port to discover new hot or bright pixel by CCD defaults.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should download the matching dark image to correct image. a automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixel image. note that the assistant remembers the last dark image and reloads this automatically in the next meeting.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and preview can help you correct within the image. the showcase shows the output of the filter with the current settings. bad pixels are lifted in all screenings.</seg>
<seg id="560">Choose an area around the defective pixel by preview and the results of the Filters. choose the best filter method to interpolate this pixel blocks. these are the available filter:</seg>
<seg id="561">Durable: it is an average of the neighbouring pixel. the resulting colour is assigned to all defective pixels in block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation, this will be taken separately for horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a spacing of 1 pixel pixel are used to calculate a bi-linear surface (2-Dim) or a group of linear curves (1-Dim). these are then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the default filter method. all pixels with a spacing of 2 or less to the pixel-block to calculate a bi-square surface (2-digit) or a group of square curves (1-Dim), which is then used to interpolate the pixel.</seg>
<seg id="564">Kubisch: all the pixels with a distance of 3 or less will be moved to interpolate a bi-cubic surface (2-digit) or a group of cubic curves (1-Dim), which is then used to interpolate the defective pixel.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below, you can see the Hotpixel correction on a colour photo, from a defective digital camera with sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposures to see the original image has been increased to 300% (1) and the correct picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The & digicomes; vignetting correction is a tool to correct the vignetization, i.e. underexposed vertices, an image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide angle lens, especially in the medium and large photo format, often do not illuminate the entire sensor range. instead & quot; vignetting at which time can reduce the light and reduce the sensor there. telephoto lens should also show this behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="568">But he also has disadvantages. many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter, which should be impossible to hold the camera with hand. wide angle lens, also with center filter, an aperture of f / 16 or less, otherwise unpredictable effects can arise.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the great exposure areas of today's film and color scanner, it is possible to simulate the effect of a Centerfilter, which without these filters, the transformation with a Centerfilter is turned into an image. the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three shelves you can control the Vignetting correction filter and with three further exposures to the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of luminous efficiency at the point of the largest density. the standard density amounts to 2.0, or by chance to compensate a luminous intensity of 2, or by chance to compensate a greater degree of vignetization, reduce it to compensate a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Shock-intensity, contrast and Gamma Settings: the edit the image with the Vignetting correction is reduced the luminosity of the pixels. you need to re-adjust the image of the target image with these options, because you only have to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a fine new adjustment to expose the target image, let the values for luminosity / contrast / Gamma at zero and do you use the gradation from the & digiplug; image processing from the menu color Gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the Vignetization correction to a picture. the original image (1) shows the correct picture in the corners and (2) the correct image. a table and contrast correction was also done in the image with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The digiplug comes; lens distortion is a tool to correct the effect of spherical lenses to photos. it uses a protected algorithm from David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortion. distortion distortion can not be corrected using this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second degree covers the general geometrical distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or the convex form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third degree has a similar round effect, but in the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient of the fourth degree corrected the remote corners to the second degree. if you combine these two, any geometrical distortion can be eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">General: this value controls the strength of the distortion part of the second degree. with negative values, K-shaped distortion can be corrected and positive values of cientists distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the thickness of the distortion part of the edges. this value is stronger than in the center of the image. for most lenses, the 'facets parameter was the inverted mark of the parameter.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this is scaled the image size, thereby making a correction of first Grades by. negative values increase while positive the image.</seg>
<seg id="583">Brightening: this value adjusts the brightness in the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners, while positive values increase it.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, the dialog with a preview the distortion error correction. the values you use for your image, are stored and used at the next start as standard values.</seg>
<seg id="585">The Telecom or ciential correction should be performed prior to all cutting or size changes. at best, you perform this correction than any first. if you cut a picture and then make a tonnage correction would be the effect of the False.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction to help you can view this tool a vertical and horizontal relief line. move the mouse button to fix the lines on this site. in connection, you can correct the component / cannular distortion with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">When you correct a ciential distortion is correct, the resulting image will be black corners. you can remove them with the cutting tool in the menu and remove the image processing or via the zoom of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">For most images, the tonnage-shaped correction can be seen. the next logical step for some motifs such as shots from the front, frame and paintings it is the perspective so that if you hold the camera with your hand, you always will always have a slight distortion of perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the K-shaped correction to a church in Norway. the original image is below (1) and the correct image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method to simulate infrared film of the glowing belts, the filter reproduces the well-known Ilford (TM) SFX200 Iinfrared film, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left hand side of the window, you can select the area for preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse, you can consider the effect on different parts of the image.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview you can set two parameters for film grafts and film sensitivity (ISO). if you simulate the grained texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO knobs changes the amount of film green (chlorophyll in nature) in conversion. green meadows will be white as snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filters colour ducts are mixed with infrared film, especially the green channel makes it not make sense to apply the effect on black / white photos, as colour information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared filtering process applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original image is set under (1) and the processed image below (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values produce a kind of Aura in the top.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digiplug; filter filmmaking is an easy-to-use tool to reproduce film grazing in your images. this is known by classical high-speed films such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X. to increase the sensitivity of the films, the manufacturer's large silels of photemulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film grained effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past. if you want to get a timeless atmosphere from everyday life. if you want to use this special, gallery-like, road photographic, grained view especially in your monochromen photos, so you must use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">With the knob, the ISO sensitivity can be calibrated to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although frequently higher values are needed, to ISO-2400. if you still need more body, you can use the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film grained for a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and the modified film sensitivity complies with ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digiplug; filter oil paintings creates the appearance of a oil painting. it uses a protected algorithm from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digiplug; filter oil paintings gives your digital images a nice appearance as the oil painting. natural pictures and styles are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two knob to influence this effect. the upper chooses the pin size between one and five. thicker brush is better suited for large images. smoothing to the smoothing or, from the other hand, the hinges.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with the (1) and the user is marked with (2). brush size for this 640 pixel image is 1 and smooth 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digiplug; filter charcoal drawing uses paint and intensity gradient to create a coal dust. the images whose gradients vary slowly. it is helpful to imagine what scene you would like to skip you. this would be good pictures to capture it.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two knob with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper controller chooses the pin size and the lower adjusts the contrast (gull).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the charcoal filter. the original image (1) and the modified image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity level.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digiplug; filter engraving the image in 3-D, as if it has been stamped in wax. it uses a protected algorithm from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & digiplug; filter engraving is a fast tool to restore your pictures with a 3-D effect. it works especially well with images with a simple structure, where color does not use the differences between color and intensity to transform the image in a gray, mondaring landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows you to adjust the contrast of the filtration. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the processed image (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">Using this filter group you can transform a normal photo in an artwork by distortion effect. it uses legally protected algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave blocks 1: divides the image in cells and can look it as if it is viewed through glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave blocks 2: analogue to the wave trap 1 the image is distorted with a different version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require long time to calculate, generate a high CPU load. you can terminate this effects at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo in an artwork by filming effects. it uses legally protected algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom Notice: wiped the picture along sternidal lines take out of a center. this simulates a zooment camera and thereby generates an dynamic expression of often in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial infinity: wiped the image by rotation of the pixel around a center. this simulates the imitation of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distances: wiped the picture to generate the effect of a non-focused compromising camera. the object seems to come back to the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Motion-shark: wiped the image by horizontal movement of pixels. this simulates the unsharpness of a linear moving, z: B: from a car or by train, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Soft pop-sharpness: wiped the picture soft to dark tones. this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour-photos or to add a warm and subtle light.</seg>
<seg id="620">Shook-sharper: distorted the image by accidental shift of pixels and simulates the sharpness of an arbitrarily moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent infinity: finds the colors in the picture and wiped them without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: shares the photo in rectangular cells and then creates it, restoring the colt with an average number of pixel.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require a long time to calculate and cause high CPU load. you can terminate this calculation at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="624">The shelves are a nice little tool to make raentropes on your image. this makes it natural your pictures a wet appearance. it uses a Pieter Voloshyena rightly protected algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Drip size allows to change the size of the drops. since the drip size does not automatically decrease the size for small images. number and density of drops. fish stocks changes the optical effect of drops on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="626">They can hold with & digiplug; image processing a range freely from raindrops. use the range of tools to keep the area, e.g. a face to stay free. if you start the filter regentropes, the area will remain free of raentropes.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the filter fillings. the original image (1) shows a quiet sunset and the beworked picture (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photograph has the wrong floor, you can attach it through mirth or turning them into the right orientation. you can find the tools in the menu transformations and transformers.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo bubbles is definitely one of the most sophisticated tools developed in order to enlarge a photo with a minimum loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">A picture to scaled down is simple. the big question is how you can see a picture? how can you see a picture? how can you see or guess the limits of dissolution? how can you find missing information or guess? the CImg algorithm which is used here is a good job. try him and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo is the wrong size you can scaled it on the desired size with the tool size. select the size change in the menu and enter the target values. the dialog box is visible below.</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool for size change uses a linear interpolation method to increase the pixel. if you want to increase a small picture with a better quality, then try the tool to blow-up.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many educational programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. spine interpolation to enlarge the image. & digiplug was used by the IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS Labors in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You need to set the tool as you want to change the size. these settings are available in the tab New size and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">The aspect ratio has retained: when this setting is activated, the aspect ratio of the original size is retained in the original size of the original size.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter concerns greater structures. the higher this value is necessary if it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh' Turbulence effect, it must be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The buttons saved as and store are used exactly. each entry for photo increase can be stored as text file and will be loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo bubbles is very fast when making it, but it can still last very long and get a high CPU load. you can terminate the calculation at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example of photo bubbles when a little color image was enlarged to double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (2) is the result of the linear standard magnification.</seg>
<seg id="640">The cutting of a photos is not only a frequently performed surgery but also a commonly underestimated tool to create a picture. just cut the picture with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and drag the rectangle, then you will see this rectangle while you move your mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">If you get rid of the mouse button, the area of the photos should be cut off. thereby, you can cut a good overview like your photo by cut. you can move the size of the rectangle below. a new rectangle creates a new rectangle with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are happy with the recording, use the button The Cutting button in the toolbar and the photo is cut off (Ctrl; + X). use the entries file saved or file Save In the File menu to save the newly created photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the screen area you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse. the aspect ration that you have defined in dialogue is preserved.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the mould you can cut the orientation as high-format or cross-format. in high format it is always assigned to the greater value of the height and in the lateral format of the width.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool normally uses an aspect ratio. that means it always is equal, regardless of whether you use centimeters, Inch or any other physical size. you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog there are two buttons around the selection automatically horizontal or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">Below in a dialogue with the Max. ratio knob to the size to the maximum possible, depending on the chosen ratio and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool allows to cut its settings depending on the image orientation (Horizontal or Vertical). if you store the cutting tool, these settings will be stored as default values in the EXIF data, so that the EXIF data is repeated that the EXIF data is reflected and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of the compositions assistance enables to involve help, so that you have to get your pictures better.</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonious triangle: harmonic particles are based on the principle of similarity. as the third party, harmonic triangles is a possibility to share a rectangle in similar harmonious triangles.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden Center: the golden centre is a split that is based on various natural growth model, such as the spiral of a Nautilus sea, or the bubbles of a sunflower. it dives in all possible things that we can find as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden partition is the Irrational number 1,618033988... and it was used to design your temples and pyramids in all times when you have your paintings, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number runs from Fibonacci Episode 1, 1, 2, 3, 8, 13, 21, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, etc. a composition that follows this rule is considered to be visually harmonious.</seg>
<seg id="654">The Golden Center presents liquefied relief lines if you assemble a picture. the help is drawn below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden Spirale will bring you good results to get closer to your photos. in comparison to the third party, the golden spiral gives the view of the viewer along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetric visual river.</seg>
<seg id="656">A further rule are the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. it should be something that the eye can be used to lead the golden spiral. it can simply be one line or different objects. this is simply because its eye can be found without the eye, it will perform its task.</seg>
<seg id="657">The golden triangles is also led from the top-discussed gold spiral. its vertex are the middle point of the sides of the golden rectangles. note that in contrast to harmonic triangles, golden triangles are no equilateral triangles. diagonal to placeming this lines can be more dynamic.</seg>
<seg id="658">When you use golden triangles around your frame, you will create a effect of professional photographs dynamic Symmetry. try your image focus on one of the cut areas and other visual information in the triangle. the result is a very attractive composition that can't reach them differently.</seg>
<seg id="659">The options horizontally mirror and sceptical mirror can be used to mirror the harmonic particles.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button color, you can set the colour of the aid lines. if you have a picture of many colors and a high contrast, the relief lines can be invisible. on this way you can customize the color of the lines your current picture.</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free Rotation is a tool to rotate a picture to each angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you make a photo, it is easy that you are not exactly vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture, where the things are turned around an angle; image processing and the tool-free rotation. select the image processing and the tool-free rotation. select the rotate free rotation and adjust the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Turn your picture with the slider angle. the values on this slider are given back to 0 degrees. a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the image are shown on the right.</seg>
<seg id="664">To your help, the module features a horizontal and vertical line at your disposal. move the mouse button in the image preview to lock him with a pressure on the left mouse button. now just adjust the angle as described in the previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you made an image, you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. an option to repair this is the function transformation from image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the image and cut the function automatic. choose one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The anti-aliasing option smoothes the image a bit after turning. note the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All pertinting transformations are carried out around a fixed point in the so-called reference point. this point is shown in the center of the image and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective, you need to use the red squares in the corners of your image. the preview will be automatically recharged. on the right side of the dialog box you will find some information which help you to change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: shows the width of the new image, including the empty areas that are made in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: shows the height of the new image, including the empty areas that are made in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle to the top: shows the current angle in degrees to the upper left corner of the transformed zone.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle to the right: displays the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the transformed zone.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle to the bottom: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed zone.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle to the right: displays the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed zone.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adaption the perspective, the image will be slightly dirty. this effect is small, but two adaptations produce a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you have to adjust the perspective, you get unbearful triangular holes at the corners. an option to use it, it is the image with transformations from image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The shot tool is used to postpone part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite. this is no rotation, the image will be distorted with other words, a rectangle is turned into a parallelogram.</seg>
<seg id="679">Switch your image by clicking the horizontal angle and vertical angle. if you set the angle to zero, the angle is set to zero. a preview of the effect will appear to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be shown on the right of the preview area.</seg>
<seg id="680">To help you get a vertical and horizontal line. move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the templates to adjust your picture.</seg>
<seg id="681">After you have carried out the scheme, the image will wiper a bit felt. for a single shot this effect is usually negligible, but two chimneys were so much duplicate and so you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After the slacking, the image has triangular holes in the corners. an option to eliminate them is the image with transformations from image editing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digiplug; requires a number of libraries and other packets to read and write image formats, therefore from your system and, in some cases, such as these libraries were compilated. in most distributions you can process a large number of image formats with & digiplug.</seg>

<seg id="810">The geographic localization of the geographic localization offers tools to localize images geographic in the spherical coordinate system, which is used by GPS and Galileo is used to localise height, longitudinal and latitude.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlated your pictures with geographical data, you need a GPS channel as a XML file in the GPX format. gpp. gpenkabel and gpp. you can download and convert your GPS device to you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Picture Geographical localization Korrelator. this interface can lead a number of selected pictures with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the images that you want to correlated in the main window and call the menu. in order to load a possible correlation between time and localization, you have to load a track file with GPX file. this file contains the same time recorded at same places such as the images of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">If the file loaded is automatic Correlation carried out the coordinates in red. GPS track data are recorded in GMT-time and therefore, the camera time must be converted with GMT. this can be carried out with the time zone. Click here your camera switches.</seg>
<seg id="815">The adjustment for the maximum time deviation is a upper deviation for the GPS time and camera-time. is the deviation among them will be merged. the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you don't have track data from a place, you can process the GPX file manually and add to the pictures. the time difference of 2000 seconds will be correlated all pictures in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options interpolate and difference in minutes can be used if you don't have appropriate data. if you know that reality is a location in a big difference between camera and GPS, you can put this limits here and then correlated the button to interpolate.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be set manually with this dialog. this is useful if you have a set of photos on the same place. since the dialog box must use OK button to use only the button OK to set the data on the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found with the displayed map correctly and then enlarge it. select the respective region and enlarge it again. height must always be selected manually. the card can always be selected manually. the card can be changed between card mode, satellite image and a mixed mode.</seg>

<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG Lossless module is a tool to alter pictures without any quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows you to store images within JPEG format, without saving the common losses on quality and metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of loss-free storage is that the file size rises, since there is no compression of the color information. this is done e.g. at PNG format.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI module digital camera client is a tool to connect your computer with a digital camera.</seg>
<seg id="838">The KIPI module has currently no documentation. if you are interested in writing these products, please contact the mailinglist of KIPI Teams under KDE-imaging @ kde.org. Note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>

<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG Kodierer module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of a diashtray.</seg>
<seg id="843">The MPEG Kodierer module can be used to convert selected pictures in a MPEG video, with a defined length, to convert the packages MjpegTools and ImageMagick. between the individual images, you can also add a basic image file in the MP2 or WAV of the diashau.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images are automatically scaled to the correct size for the selected video format. in addition, you can create a background color for the diashau. with this module, it is possible to create DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player. finally, you can eventually use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">You must first packed the images that should be packed into the MPEG Diashau. thereafter, you can start using extras MPEG Diashau.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images selected by you are listed below image files in the portfolio. there you can also change the photos or content of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are satisfied with your list, you should customize the other settings. if you're looking for the video format, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. in case you are planning the appropriate TV standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is preset and most probably the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">The next step, you should specify a picture in seconds. the speed of the image process is set down below. a lower value produces very sudden, high-quality images.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set as next. in doubt you should set it black. the name and the path of the generated file can be set within the name of the MPEG-output file. keep it as possible.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you want to specify a audio file under the name of the audio source file, you can easily drink the generation of the movie. depending on the speed of your computer you can now drink a coffee or drink the diashau if you return back.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a hint appears that Kodiers or tools are missing, you can adjust the paths to the programs of the MjpegTools and ImageMagick packets to the right below.</seg>
<seg id="852">The printer driver allows you to print multiple images on a sheet paper together in standard photocities. the combined images can also automatically be opened automatically with the image processing Gimp. this is useful to enhance or print using the Gimp module for direct expression.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module, you can import your images stored in one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command line dcraw from Dave Coffin. an original condition of Him is not expecting you get from dcraw, such as the software produced by your camera vendor. sometimes you get better results with dcraw better results!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First choose the RAW file to be converted, and launch the module. the Raw-Converter window appears then in mode for a single image. with the button preview, you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option decides, whether the camera settings can be adjusted for the white balance. if the result is not optimal, you can process the image later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-color RGBG conversion can be selected to use the contrasting information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switches has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are happy with preview, you can choose one of the three output formats. the filename is equal, and only the extension will be adapted accordingly. JPEG uses a lossless algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">Tagged Image Format, TIFF, retains all the information of your image and uses the lossless LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">In case you have to process your pictures often or later, you should not use the JPEG format, as there is only a limited number of operations permitted before joining the image quality. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you are able to choose JPEG as an memory file, the metadata is stored in the RAW file, in the JPEG file, in the EXIF data.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you are adapted to your settings, you can start converting the conversion button. if you want to restop this process, you can abstain from this process.</seg>
<seg id="863">The stacking processing mode allows you to convert various images to once. use this mode if you are sure, for testing at a single image, which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to the version for individual images. however, this is helpful to overwrite it. however, this is helpful to do this in an earlier attempt. a preview is not available. the progress bar shows how far the conversion is advanced.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to compress all images in an album. it uses the program convert from ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all images of a album. you can set the prefix, the starting number and the timestamp of the album.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of several pictures of a image collection. it uses the transfer program from the ImageMagick package. you can scaled the image smaller or enlarge it four types of image change:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in dimension. width or height of the image will be automatically selected, depending on the picture orientation, the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): size change in two dimensions. here, the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option for example to fit your image format.</seg>
<seg id="870">Not proportionally: not proportions of change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed at this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Printing process: preparing the image for the photo pressure. the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the photo paper. the target picture, including background size, marginal size and background color is adjusted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected pictures with your favorite E-mail program. there is also possible to leave the size of sending images in advance. other pictures can go to the list of sending images and drop there.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you start the module, the pictures window with the chosen images are displayed. you can add more pictures using a file selection dialog. for the last attached image will be displayed a preview of the right hand side.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also draw images on the picture-list and add the images to the list of sending images.</seg>
<seg id="875">Using the button pictures the selected pictures from the list of sending images are removed.</seg>
<seg id="876">After you have selected all pictures, you can open the New Message -window of your e-mail clients. you need to add here the addresses and the bedding. the selected pictures are already attached as appendix.</seg>
<seg id="877">Don't pay attention to many pictures at once. most e-mail accounts are restrictions for the size of sending e-mails. it is possibly a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send many images.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window is used to change the settings for sending images. your configuration is stored and stored each time until you change it.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your e-mail clients from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you have to specify the right path for your installation.</seg>
<seg id="880">In case you use the Google Mail Service, you must install the GMailagent on your computer. you can download this here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After the application of comments in an attached file, the comments are added to the images in a text file and is added to the email.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format under the menu Images File format is not very suitable to use the size of photo files, but it is best adapted among the lossless formats such as TIFF. if you have a fast internet connection, and the photo quality should not be changed. otherwise, we recommend the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you want to select JPEG format, select the original files in JPEG format, then you will add the original copy data to send pictures.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is finished, the window will not be closed automatically, so that you can view the status messages, in search of errors, you can automatically turn off at the end. with the knob you can lock this window wilie? EN.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the module advanced Diaschau appears to have a window with questions like you want to have your Diashau. you can choose between the selected and all the images of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">The OpenGL option in the presentation uses very elegant images using OpenGL. however, you need to have an appropriate graph card, because otherwise the Diashau must be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The filename option ensures that the filename of images in the left corner is displayed on the lower left corner.</seg>
<seg id="888">The loop loop ensures that the presentation will be displayed in an endless loop. you can then break out manually with Esc.</seg>
<seg id="889">The option photos randomly select that the images are shown in a random sequence. so it is not used the order of images in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">Below the delay between the images can be set between the individual images. 1500 milliseconds match 1,5 seconds and are a good standard. the best distance depends on your computer and the selected transition effect. you should be able to test this before you show your friends!</seg>
<seg id="891">There are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can choose. randomly select a different effect at each transition between the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="892">During the Diashau you can connect to a toolbar at the upper left screen of the screen. move the mouse into this corner for you.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this tool bar, you can hold the presentation and start again, start the previous and next picture and stop the diashau.</seg>
<seg id="894">At the lower bottom of the screen you can see the current filename, the position of the current picture and the total number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">Currently, the KIPI module time & date only has no documentation. if you are interested, please contact the mailinglist of the KIPI Teams under KDE-imaging @ kde.org. Note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>

<seg id="917">& photo album; gives you two ways to create HTML pages with your images. the one is in & photo album; integrated and the other as module available (see). in the following part of the user manual, it is described in & photo album; built-in version you can create and retrieve the HTML menu.</seg>
<seg id="918">Before HTML pages are created you need to set some settings. these are split into the three areas of content, layout and finish. in the following information, each area will be more precise.</seg>
<seg id="919">First enter the title of the file and a description that should contain the HTML file later. on photo album; HTML example pages do you see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next you choose whether a & photo album; export file is to be created on the heading page. you will find further information about export files you will find in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Lastly, you can select which information on the HTML pages can be displayed, which can be displayed clearly without a description. for example, that all pictures of a party are shown. you can not use all pictures. you can't use this setting to hide certain images prior to certain template.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this section you can define how the HTML pages should look like. most setting options are unique, which is why not specifically received in this section.</seg>
<seg id="923">Below on the page you can set different resolutions for the images. thereby, those need to view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution of 800x600, no pictures anymore, for example, a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">You can change the resolution at any time you can change the resolution at any time. it's possible to browse your images with low resolution, indicating to a lower transmission time, and, if he wants to get a larger image, he changes to higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setting range you place the different folders and the URL where your website is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">Most of your HTML files, choose a basic folder for all your HTML files and a new subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="927">First, you have to select the main folder where all your images are stored. this folder will be stored and set automatically during the next time. this folder can select either a folder or from KDE supported protocol, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your images, you can check if this really are all for viewer. if you are created for the basis folder a URL, after the pages are created, the URL you should be installed here. otherwise, the web browser should start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files created by you are not yet in final target folder you need to copy it manually. so, the import function will need to specify the final destination of the files. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the base folders in which all sub-folders will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="930">The just described options described above all three are related to baseline or URLs. in these, a subfolder will create, whose name you can define in the folder folder.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you're looking forward to a family party, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & photo album, you may need to view a HTML page to view the images. if you're using a HTML page to view the images, recording, etc., you have to do with & photo album; this work must not even make.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & photo album; you can export a copy of your images into a .kim file. you can import other data into your database. they are imported with exceptions and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim -files, internal and external. they differ as if the images itself is saved in the file, that you can have all pictures together, and this file can be saved as independent. the obvious disadvantage is however the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can create a .kim file directly from the menu file export... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file along with a HTML file, this is an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">One external .kim file searches the pictures on two times. first, the images that are given in the file of .kim -file are searched, so the images of the URL you can search for creating the html-files. this is only possible if you have created your .kim file using HTML import.</seg>
<seg id="936">In the following dialog for exporting images, you can download from the menu file export...</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog box is to act in order to act internal or external .kim files. it offers you the following three selection options:</seg>
<seg id="938">When you manually copy the images to the .kim-file, you need to copy the images in the same folder as the .kim-file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the option Automatically copied and copied to the .kim-file format; the pictures automatically be used for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim -files are normal Zip files. as most of the images are already compressed using JPEG and the XML file itself is quite small it is not worth to compress the files. if you want to compress this, just select the export file to compress it.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is maximum image size limit. if you would like to send your friends images, because the .kim file would be very big enough. here, you can limit the size, by example, that each image will be maximum 800 pixels high and width.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you select a file with the extension .kim from the web browser or from the menu file Import, will be & kphotoelectric Album; the exported database as described in detail.</seg>
<seg id="943">The assistant to importing consists of four steps. first, you need to select which pictures you want to import, afterwards, in which folders should be copied to import pictures.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you should personalise the category of people to the imported file (if you are a Dane), while this category is asked for your database. this is why you should be imported in the third dialog box, which are to be imported into your database and correspond to which categories are in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step, you can finish the categories of the imported file with the categories of your current database. an example will see you on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="946">It must be simple to view images and watch: when you see images, you would like to view images of your Italy's vacation and see a picture of your friend you wish to see images on which this friend is depicted, see images.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this handbook, you will find the various steps of (1) adding the information about your pictures, through (2) the searches and look at up to (3) advanced topics and adaptations.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoalbum was started as a program to manage your pictures. but it has been extended and today also cares your videos. at many places in this manual will have been talking about images, but frequently, this also closes videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& photo album; stores all its information in the dx.xml file in the top folder of their images. this is a simple XML file, which allows you to backup to a program or revisions in CVS, where you want.</seg>
<seg id="950">& photo album; please note the folder where your images are saved and uses this in future Starts automatically. if you want to start a different file tree with pictures, you can start & photo album; with the option -c. as an example: kphoto album -c ~ / company / Photos / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Via the menu entry settings; set up to a window, where you can change the settings of & photo album; you can change the settings of the user manual in the following section of the user manual.</seg>
<seg id="952">On the left you can see six different symbols with which you can preview the settings of Preview and the options for viewing, you can call an exhaustive help to call the F1 key and a click on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">It was described to you as you can set different qualities for each picture, e.g. persons, locations and keywords. you can also create your own groups such as items, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">In order to see the dialog, which is used to process existing groups. for any existing group you can select a label and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">Under subcategories, subcategories were already mentioned. in the dialogue options, you can set up complete member groups, i.e., all members of a group set up once in a group instead of all groups of a central glides as stated in.</seg>
<seg id="956">In case you can see the setting options you can choose to set up the member groups. with the above selection list, you can configure the category. in the left window boxes, you can select a list of the current category and in the right a list of subcategories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& photo album; shares his modular system with other graphics applications, such as digikam and Gwenview. this modular system is called KIPI and means & KDE; image plugin interface. read more on the homepage of Kipi.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be called upon the menu modules. the modules can not be described, because they are not part of & photo album, but are separately distributed. most modules have a help page that you can call on the modules itself.</seg>
<seg id="959">As the modules of multiple applications can be used together, it can be used to test the modules with & low photo album; you should first use the demo database with the command &gt; kphoto album -demo &lt; username\ &gt; or via the help menu. don't say, I would not have warned.</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that use modules over KIPI, are very different, making it possible that some modules with & photo album is not functioning. this is the disadvantage, if you divide functions with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & photo album; and other applications that can use CIPI, is that the other applications can be found in albums; even though & photo album; this kind of order does not support the order to albums, so you can use the functions with & photo album.</seg>
<seg id="962">Simulates & photo album; the current album, which corresponds to the current view, so all images that shows the picture preview at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="963">Besides the current album you have to have a photo album; the modules also has a list of albums. here goes & photo album; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & photo album; s browser shows the contents of a category, e.g. all persons, then each entry of this category is an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or the category, which you have set in the Settings dialog as a category for virtual albums, used. if you are using for example the category persons, is used & photo album; so you would like to have persons selected to view and to share this module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & photo album; you can not remove this from the list of modules. launch the settings dialog and select the modules installed in the modules installed.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example of a starting screen as soon as you & photo album; with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you can see it from any other KDE application, you can see as a menu and toolbar. under the toolbar, you can view the window, as you can't see any information about your pictures. in the section we will show you all the images that shows you an overview with all existing pictures.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main features of & photo album; is the possibility to view any image with comments, where the image has been recorded separately or for a larger number of images certain comments are shown. if for example, on all images Jesper pictures and all pictures in Copenhagen have been recorded.</seg>
<seg id="970">All of these notes may be used for searching and Browse, as you can read in the section. if you like to check this comment when you use the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">In view three lists with a text field by using persons, locations and passwords. these are a very important part of & photo album, since you will always use it again if you need information about your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is based on the picture within the list: if you have a family business, and on all 50 images, the same 5-10 persons can be mapped, you can find that the used names are shifted upward, which can be found faster and allocated.</seg>
<seg id="973">In case you prefer to receive a alphabetically sorted list, click on the symbol for sorting to date under the list.</seg>

<seg id="1046">If you choose the first method, POV-Ray pursues a beam to the addiction of pixels with super-sampling. if you need to adjust the value of an additional number of pixels with super-sampling, a grid of 4x4 will be calculated additionally, at a depth of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional beams per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixels, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue in the second pixel. the difference is then:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 beams per pixel. if the difference between the colours is shared, the pixel is divided into 4 sub-pixel, which can be used individually and checked for a further subdivision. the maximum depth of records can be set to the depth of depth.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another possibility to reduce aliasing effect is the generation of noise for the beam process, called Jittering. if you switch jittering, changes & Povray; the beams around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for the quality of the Renderns is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental property of & Povray; the diffuse reflection specxion is calculated. it takes a very long to calculate a scene with this feature.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this map ticket you can adjust whether the alpha channels are calculated using POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent if the corresponding beams have no object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Open a new window for displaying the & Povray; -console output. if & Povray; unexpectedly, you can find the reason for this.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import an & Povray; select the menu entry into Import... and select a file in the dialog window.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently supports & kpovmodeler; not even the complete command of & Povray;. when importing error messages or warnings, a dialog window indicates a list of messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not support source code in & kpovmodeler; write these spring text between the two special comments / / * PMRawBegin and / / * PMRawend.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can extract objects from object tree into the editor to export the source text file in the Editor. to import objects into the scene file, select the source code in Editor and draw him into the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With copying and paste in & kpovmodeler; and in your editor, you can also include source for & Povray; also included.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called if & kpovmodeler; a scene usually is povray or x-povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click on help in your own image view, opens & kpovmodeler; the & Povray; user documentation to the displayed object. put the path to your document and the version. versions 3.1g and 3.5.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; search for external files (for example, altiddging) in the path to the & Povray; libraries. if you refer to files that are not in the folder of the scene, you must also enter the path into different path of the library, the first found file is used.</seg>
<seg id="1062">The color for wire-models. the second color is used to display the selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">The color for control points. the second color is used for displaying the selected control points.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The colour of the rectangle for the visual field in the camera view and in the window Type logo.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can set the object of points on the pitch in the context menu of the wire-pin Views. you can set the grid separately for pushes, scaling and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Greater values make an accurate wire model and thus a better nails for the shown objects, but require more time to renders. for some objects such as the sphere you can adjust the detailed level for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you cross the highly detailed projections for extended projections, all wire model controls are further divided, if the camera is extended to extended projections, with exceptions from perspective and pertinent projections. this feature gives a better approach to projections, but requires more time to renders.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you cross wall display a wall behind the objects, the wall is depicted in a chess break samples from two adjustable colours.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you cross the floor, a soil is framed below the objects. the floor is shown in a chess break samples from two adjustable colours.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you cross edge working, the non-recursive antialiasing method for the rendering of scenes is used. the values for depth and swelling values can be adjusted. more information on the parameters you can find in section Render modes.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page you can create existing window orders or create new window orders. in the window sakes section, you can create and store window orders.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The combination field standard window order: displays all existing window sakes. & kpovmodeler; used the selected window order in the start of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list of tapped windows orders displays all existing shutdowels. a new arrangement allows you to create and delete a selected arrangement with the button.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Every window order is identified by the name. the name must be clearely and may not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list below shows all views of the chosen windowcode. new views can be created with the button and remove selected Views with the button Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The position of the new window. with new column you create a new column on the right side of the available window, with card card, you can view a map postcard, together with the previous view and floating, the view does not contain in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you have just & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installed and now you want to start without more accurate knowledge of both programs. if you're able to create all steps in this guide, you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene: a ball on one level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should carefully consider the following warnings, before you make sure that you use as a result of a black screen. if you use a 3D program for the first time you should consider this important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you do not adjust the camera, no rules for the rendering will be applied, as a result, you will get a black image.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you insert any light sources, your whole scene is in the dark, and you will only receive a black image.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have all installed incorrectly, you see at the first start of & kpovmodeler; the following default window order:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to know the menus and the existing symbols of the toolbar. read the documentation, so you can get a reasonable presentation, what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will need to use these menus and symbols, so you should remember the menus and symbols, and also their applications.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to remove this guide, you must first remove all objects from the object tree. mark the scene and then select the menu entry to edit. so you have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire-model view shows how the camera shows the whole scene that you generate. in particular, the view of the scene from the view of the camera. this shows you the outcome of the scene of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera. if you click on it, see the contents of the view object properties which can find the different parameters of the camera. in the user documentation to & Povray; you will find further details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Change nothing to the basic settings of the camera, that's later instructions reserved, but please note that camera's camera in view control points, with which you can change the target point of the camera. just click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired place.</seg>
<seg id="1088">If you press the button or the entrances, change the wire-size Views and the object tree immediately accordingly to these settings. as a result, they see here the scene from the viewpoint of camera.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the bottom for the scene. for example, you could add a Quotony (inserting endony body Quader) and the size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but that is an comprehensible approach to solution of this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; offers really a simpler way. you can use an infinite level as the ground:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the level in object tree, change the name and press the button User or the entrances. in the object tree, the new name will be displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire-window view is also showing the level, although at the moment only a limited level. when you renders the scene, the level extends the level to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If you can view the object tree, you will find that you can find the entry for any new object. in this case you can see the options for each new object: angeling, rotation and shift. choose one of these options, change the possible settings in the view of the object properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene you should shift the soil for exercise a unit under the horizontal line, so you can learn some of these parameters. choose the shift and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">Select the ground only to adjust its material properties. there are many different materials, but select a little bit multiple.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases a dialog when you can choose to select how the object should be inserted. the pigment is then changed in the object tree (name = bottom pigment), with one click on the button. see how the pigment is now looks.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the preview of pigments only shows a matt black material because you can check the look of materials at any time with a click on preview. if you are able to preview the appearance of materials at any time. now there are many possibilities, but you now take the easiest way.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you do not see any color on quader and ball, click on the user button and then call the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is right now. if you can now run your picture with a click on the symbol, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course, this does not have the colour that you are expected. here you need to set two new attributes. in addition, select this entry twice (you can do this also more frequently, but the chboard color list can be used only with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">In the object tree, select one time and change the colours in the object of object characteristics:</seg>
<seg id="1102">This step, you should be simply run, as you might understand the basic working methods of & kpovmodeler; the ball is just as easy as the ground:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the object properties you can immediately change the settings. set the value for the radius: 1 (do not forget the input button or the button), so the sphere would be float over the floor, because you would have shifted the ground to a unit downwards.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, the Rendering results now a rare result: as already before, the ball surface appears like a matt black material. put on the following step a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you select the ball, you can now add a material now. as in the ground, give the ball a pigment as color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Choose First subobject and change the name for example in sphere pigment. Click the scoop of pigments, then choose entry and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can achieve even more interesting effects, if you take time to set some finish properties:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values like in the following screen photos and click on Users or press the entrances.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The shine effect and reflection are already able to result in some good visual effects, perfect for glass or chrome surfaces, even if metal is not selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression that provides you & kpovmodeler; provides hopefully you have learned so much, that you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytracygen is a Render method to produce a two-dimensional image of a three-dimensional scene or one model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">When you encounter a scene raytracer, the renders hypothetical beams from the view of the viewer, which is reflected and broke out, the scene of light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects of the light sources can be effected, such as fog, the scene pixels for pixels being processed.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you will see without a camera, the camera is your eye, with which you see the scene. without a light source, you can see any scene. obviously, any scene need to be rendered, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">The usual file dialog box can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Open a file. in the default file dialog you can select a file which you have previously using & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open a new model or create, the file is inserted into this submenu and replace the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you have already saved the model, it is stored under the same name. if it's a new file, you have to enter a name and storage space.</seg>

<seg id="1121">Saves the current window order and opens a dialog in which you can enter a name for a new arrangement or overwrite an existing configuration.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu, you will find options for setting & povmodeler; here you can change the look, the shortcut and the default behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog for changing the keyboard-shorter. you can change commands to change or add new commands to this option.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Open a dialog for Setup of the tool bar. you can add and remove the tool symbols for & kpovmodeler; add commands and remove.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A Bump-Map is a possibility to wrap rough surfaces without any bump on the surface and change without any geometrical form of the object.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is common to use the same file for a Bump-Map as well as for a texture Map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic body are simple geometrical forms which you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these plots. these models are then processed further to give them a more realistic appearance.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture Map is a possibility to give the surface of an object color to pixels, through application of image file as color card.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& skillshow; is a comfortable image viewer and browser. the application has a file browser where you can choose pictures to display.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Pictures can be displayed either in a window in the image of the image or in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">The usage of & skillshow; is very simple. the file browser lists files to show you with clicking on the & LMBn; or button return.</seg>
<seg id="1132">You can adjust whether each picture should be displayed in a window or if any images should use the same window.</seg>
<seg id="1133">If you search for a certain file, just type the first character of the filename in the browser window. if a matching filename is found, the file will be highlighted. you can leave the input field by pressing Return Return, or Esc.</seg>

<seg id="1183">The DCOP-Interface of Amarok has many general functions which are mostly used in other KDE programs. this section consists of six parts and should describe the DCOP-functions of collection, context-browser, player, playlist, playlist browser and scripts. a sample call for the DCOP function could be & zb; as look like this:</seg>
<seg id="1184">Amarok supports the command line options of Qt and & KDE; in addition Amarok has several own command line options.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should give the user a feedback, if the script may not be executed because of a lack of dependency. please check if all the modules are available and use the dialog, so the user does not run a script.</seg>

<seg id="1187">In the folder scripts / templates you can find a lot of template scripts in many different languages. you can use it as a base for your own scripts, or simply use them to enlarge the required functions. you will quickly find that the writing of scripts are relatively easy.</seg>
<seg id="1188">Using DCOP, you can exchange your scripts with amarok and control Amarok. the simplest way is the use of the command dcop; which should be climbed every KDE installation.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripts allow the execute of external programs and commands. this is usually the function exec (). in this way, dcop &gt; is relatively easy to be called. here is an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& amarok; sends alerts on all running scripts. for this reason, scripts will continue to monitor their standard awarding cases and respond to events. of course, a script may also ignore the events, if there is no use.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure the script to display the dialog button. in order to keep the storing and loading the configuration data every script will take care of every script, Amarok puts the working folder on the folder where all data should be stored.</seg>

<seg id="1194">Custommenue Title: submenu menu entries to the selected files of the playlist, if a user-defined menu entry, if a user-defined menu entry can also be used to remove the DCOP-function dcop amarok (submenu Language Title). in order to remove the script, dcop amarok, postmenstrual MenuItem (submenu itemTitle).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & Order is concluded, or if the user stops a script, sends the signal SIGTERM to the script. this signal should be processed for example. for example, storing data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amarcord script can also install script packages that can be compressed as script and zb. such packets are basically encoded with bzip2 (.tar) that can optionally be identified with bzip2 (.bz2) that the user can clearly recognize the archive as a Amarok script package.</seg>

<seg id="1243">Amaroah requires only the package Kdelibs and else no other KDE packages. you need to have Kdelibs so installed (including the programs contained), because & amarok; requires some of them to compiled for example modules or scripts. we have written a small guide, how to compile Kdelibs minimal.</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some features such as the OSD require that your window manager will work the relevant standards of freedesecop.org. we are trying to support amaroque on all platforms, therefore we use Kdelibs and Qt, because they are able to provide excellent development environment.</seg>
<seg id="1245">Probably, one of your files will make an error in the TagLib library to days. you can see the file recovery by taking into ~ / .kde / share / apps / aman.log file. after that, you can delete the file on the TagLib developers under bugs.kde.org. afterwards, you can delete the file and create the collection once again.</seg>

<seg id="1250">You can also send the backtrace by e-mail (the e-mail opens automatically at a crash). if it is an frequently occurring crash and send us a good backtrace, the error will be fixed.</seg>
<seg id="1251">This is due to write a lot of program data as UTF-8 in meta-infos, but it is not known as Unicode character. the following Perl script delays the problem.</seg>

Click this icon to follow the piece in the MusicBrainz database.</seg>
<seg id="1348">Under the MusicBrainz icon you will find more information about the current piece. you can see here as often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as his rating.</seg>
<seg id="1349">In order to display cover images in context-browser, the cover images are shown in the same folder as the current. file formats .jpg, .jpeg, .gif and .png are supported. the context-browser will also display cover pictures, which have either been downloaded or embedded in ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1350">The next area, Recommended pieces, lists multiple recommended pieces. if you click on one of these pieces, it will be played immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1351">Among the Recommended pieces are the favorite pieces of this interpreter. this area shows the five highest rated pieces of the current interpreters.</seg>
<seg id="1352">You can adjust the information displayed in the music window. Click with the right mouse button somewhere in the subwindow and select from the context menu.</seg>

<seg id="1511">Open the main layout dialog of & kaudiocreator; with different map cards (such as Encoder, to set up the Encoders). after this, you must go before the program can be used successfully!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes audio quality, coding and compression rates and helps you choose the right Kodier's choice.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is to perish, a lossless audio format is needed. besides FLAC there are others like 'shorts' or 'Monkey' which may be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats, the information collected by data compression according to their psychoacoustic model are MP3 and OGG the most common. OGG mag is a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but the differences are less important, since both coders are very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'no such 'free, lame is still supplied with most distributions for free, but there are open licence questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high up to very high sound quality (at high bit rates) but compared to OGG slightly lower quality at lower depth rates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is one of the computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG-playing devices are available.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music is also owned on other devices, such as standard DVD player, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard disk) or special car stereo. today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices can only support MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of parameters to the audio quality and resulting compression ratios for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for further parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= This setting should usually offer acceptable for most people and most music pieces of acceptable transparency, and has quite high quality. good enough for hi-fi systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset Extreme '= 224 - 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. requires up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and somewhat less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset Extreme -b 256' = 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. requires more 256 kbps for complex and less complex designs of a titels. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h '= 128 kbps CBR common stereo, compression rate about 11. 128 kbps for all the pieces of a titels. good enough for music of young people, portable devices and autoosterone plants. but not good enough for better fi stereo.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting is exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely do the absolutely highest quality, without respect to the file size, then select this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information, manually entered or collected by the program from FreeDB via the Internet, are available as a list of parameters. it can be used as a list of parameters. it can be used to create folders and file names, as well as the characteristics of music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with Kodierprograms there is often a combination of program settings for the coders and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the Kodiers explain the switch for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example to add the & CD; titles are encoded with lame (tag) if MP3s must be encoded with lame, the switch -tt is lame and the title parameter of & kaudiocreator; the result looks as follows: '... -tt {Test}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & audiocreator; parameters that can be used (= button designation in the assistant):</seg>
<seg id="1530">That's what the FreeDB is: a free database, which can read the information up / enter into the host, so that all other these information can be downloaded from the computer itself. it is considered only from text, & CD; titles, artists, names of the pieces & etc., not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (Anm of the translation: so that is the author) am not attorney. however, nobody can prevent that you can damage from the & CD; and all information can be done by a Bummel by a & CD; business, physically or virtual.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & audiocreator; is actively to choose a check box (sending an address). in this type of configuration, it seems that the e-mail address will not be used by the server (this can not only know the programmer that has the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are many different countries copies of the main database. if & caudiocreator; for the use of FreeDB, the geographical distribution is supposed to be used. this saves bandwidth on the network and resembles the load between the computers.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to Friedb.org provides a current list of mirror vern for online demand of & CD; information during reading a & CD; alternatively the entire database can be downloaded or (usually per month) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which selection program is used to store pieces from the & CD; to save WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There's rumors that cdparanoia is used; whoever wants to be more specific to read the source code.... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD; see. to note that the cdparanoia package from the appropriate distribution must be installed first if this has not happened yet.</seg>
<seg id="1537">For saving the stored WAV files, the Kodiers and hence the desired file format can be selected. during the first opening set the code for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (a lossless compression for audio data) can be added to the encoding of the Kodier. other coders can be added to this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Coaster Package needs to be installed from the appropriate Linux distribution prior to the Kodierer. this is also available for the predefined Kodiers. more information on Kodiers are in chapter Welcher Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a Kodierers more information about its switches can be obtained through the input of a command like lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console). it must be replaced by the name of the installed Kodierers.</seg>
<seg id="1540">This may have many reasons. check the device name of the & CD; / DVD drive that are installed both cdparanoia as well as the audio coders of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for OGGs, FLAC & etc;). try to retrieve both programs with a command line in a terminal. this could give a reference to what is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you don't want to read a copy protected audio CD; check out the shell of the & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with a step by step example. even if you use other settings, this tips can be done as you must proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">If you read the complete manual, everything understood but somehow are still unsafe what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will prepare enough information to create those areas that you want to make the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time to setup all and our first & CD; we will use lame '--preset Extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 up to 256 kbps on average and ID3v1 sample words (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">It must be cdparanoia and lame is already installed on your computer. both programs should be downloaded as a pre-compiled package for your Linux distribution as it is considered a non-free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files, whatever you can do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have write permission to write (eg; trying to copy with the cross-section or anything).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section deals with the basic setup of & kaudiocreator; something which is probably done only once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the approach to read a & CD; what has to be repeated for any out & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the compression of music (lame) and audio format (MP3) as well as the resulting audio quality (MP3) as well as the resulting audio quality (MP3) as well as the resulting audio quality (MP3) as well as the resulting audio quality (MP3) as well as we are lazy to use the program to download the FreeDB files and download data from the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings anytime, we will probably do it with any reading of a & CD; if once the matching settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name will be handed over to the reading program to read the & CD; -data / pieces can be read.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Frequently is / dev / cdrom a symbolic link on the real device name of your drive. if this is not working or if more than a & CD; / DVD drive can be set, so, a look into the file / etc / fstab an attempt to install existing entries for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The ticket card General settings. here it's not much to do. here, an additional transformation can be defined. in our example, everything will be shown as illustrated in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only For incomplete information may be asked if you want to be informed when referring to the reference of keywords (tags) are missing.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The ticket card CD; settings. simply select both entries. we are convenient and allow the & CD; download data via the Internet from a FreeDB computer.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the calculator must be connected during the reading of the & CD; to connect to the Internet, so that it can access to the FreeDB server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection box is simpler, a & CD; entry found immediately, if you're unhappy with the database-entry, and the filename or filename should be easily changed. the directory and filename is modified with conques - &gt; renaming, and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & KDE.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, if you want to enter everything manually, the selection fields and FreeDB file is not used. however, the two selection fields must be selected, at least the first selection fields must be selected, at least the first one. the mode will be set up on the following map card.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is for us FreeDB. these are settings for data enquiry, for the retrieve of the & CD; information from FreeDB server over the Internet. how to know the system which data will get the CD? read the section about FreeDB, see how it is shown in the screen photo.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we don't have downloaded the database, we only want to work with remote database on the Internet Server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB server: please go to the page freedb.org and look after a mirror server nearby. on this way the load between the machines will be distributed as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both work as well as for the server, as many firewall marks the protocol 8880 according to default, there are perhaps more fortunate with the protocol 80, as the & HTTP; protocol usually is open to surf in the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example, we want to transfer & CD; data to the FreeDB server. the first check box should be enough.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Simply take the settings of screenshot. (make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of simultaneous pieces: excuse for excuse, is there a reason why more than one at the same time when using only one existing drive? parallel reading and encode? the author knows it not so easy to try.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; check out after reading the last piece: cross this to the & CD; at the end of the trial.</seg>
<seg id="1567">Custom file for temporary files: if you cross the checkbox, then the path can be stored in which the WAV files can be stored. if the box is not enabled, the files will not be installed in the private folder. don't forget this folder when you want to make something with WAV files.</seg>
<seg id="1568">All the way as it is on the screen photo. the command is somewhat long, under circumstances should be bloomed slightly towards the right.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset Extreme 'defines the audio quality of MP3s. as previously mentioned, this is an setting for very good audio quality, even for very good HiFi stereo systems. the result is a good balance between audio quality and storage consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' to restrict the creation of tags on version V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2 "Tags: in case of later use of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the inputs (including the complete path) and the output file (including the complete path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Put the rest as in the screen photo. some comments for future use outside of this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of simultaneous WAV files: with a Dualcore or Quad-core or even a multiprocessor machine can be tried to encode more than a WAV file at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">This is, we just finished the basic setup of & kaudiocreator; this configuration will be used as a standard for any reading of a & CD; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music, you never need them to change again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">This section is described, as the process of the reading of the & CD; it is set up on the hard disk. first, we will be able to recover files on the hard disk, as we are convenient and the & CD; data from the FreeDB file is described, and the process that is described in this section must be repeated for any out & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we have a & CD; do not include the screen photos a little different than those for a & CD; with successfully aired by FreeDB, you will learn how to retrieve data from the Internet instead of using the Internet. comments are displayed on the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Don't try out the & CD; this example is a 'special' edition of the author of this handbook.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this has not happened yet, now the & CD has to be defined in the drive that has been defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment, the pieces and their length should be listed in the window, as in the screen photograph, this only if the & CD; as audio CD; identified and could be read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this is not done, look for questions and answers after the help or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the & CD; successfully used by the FreeDB, all titles of the pieces are already completed and in addition the name of the artist and the album is shown.</seg>
<seg id="1581">For the case, it's more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; key to your & CD; there will be a window embedded, and you can choose the database entry, which your opinion is best on your & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you do not select the check box for automatic query from FreeDB (on the page & CD; settings dialog for Settings), you can also select this manually by choosing the first anopfs in the toolbar. if you pick no local database, but require the connection to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 Step 2: the CD-Editor - input of the CD data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; accordingly to the pattern on the next screen photo. the title of the piece in the first row of the input field 'Update title', the rest of the data in the input field 'Album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist must not be entered in the input field 'Update title' unless you have an arrangement with different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The lower commentary box can be used for the individual comments inidially per piece, the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply to all the pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Caution: after successful withdrawal of data from the FreeDB file, the CD editor is not empty, but it is always a good idea to start the content of the CD-Editors (e.g. if all words with capital letters start or not...), but also to examine whether there is any undesired remarks.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example we use only ID3v1 tags. this is limited to the length of the fields, Album, and Title of a piece and on only 28 characters for the comment. this option will be set up to the KodierererSettings tab. take a look at the dialog tab.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the day information of the generated files at any time with the tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags will not be supported by all codiers or file formats. see from the help of Kodierer to get more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Just select an entry obviously with the style of the trigger CD; in this example, it is not important that we can't exceed the & CD; for more information go to the Internet website. pop or .ap. for example, you can find under Rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After selecting 'OK' you come back to the main window. just click on the line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD-Editors appears again and you see that the fields for the album is already filled with the entered data, which we wish for the first piece. specify the item for the fields of the current piece. if you wish to request the item for each case and other information you wish.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next row in the main window and process in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1595">Warning: this window appears not when you downloaded the data from the FreeDB file. it is already sorted into one of these categories.</seg>
<seg id="1596">"" "it is the third button of the tool bar." "" "note that the artist and the album will be shown above the piece list." ""</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there is a check-in before each line of a piece. only the titles are selected, and make sure all the pieces are selected, or assorted the button All the pieces select at the bottom edge of the screen to select all the pieces at once.</seg>
<seg id="1598">By clicking on the button selection process, this window appeared on the button. then click OK and then let's see a look at the window with the essays and track what is going on.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the rider's orders for switching on the job window. it is in the left upper half of the window, directly under the buttons of the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window on check of orders. the first piece is set out onto the hard disk. the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status line.</seg>
<seg id="1601">This error message you will see if you are attempting to work with a coerer, which you have not installed yet. plays are not successfully encoded with a red 'X' in the list list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the TMP file and the target folder are not what we have entered here in example. have you checked if you have a write access to the temporary files and target folder?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear that the error occurred directly after the end of the reading of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The order 1 reads the first piece that it is finished. but we have made a new entry: order 4 is the coding of pieces 1 into the format MP3. thus, read and coding in parallel. note the status of the bottom part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has no configuration settings to instruct this behaviour, the number of parallel processes to read and encode. with high performance machines, the calculator with an AMD64 seems to have no problem with simultaneous reading and encode (however, two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now, the last title will be read, while another piece is coded, and a third order is encoded in the queue-long of the body. after the last piece is coded, a little window will be filled with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & audio audiocreator; you'll need & KDE; 3.x. or 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to generate compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG, you need the code of your choice.</seg>
<seg id="1608">& kaudiocreator; if you have known as part of the auto-media package, you can download from there an anonymous copy here. most distribution boxes are already a pre-compiled package, as & caudiocreator; a part of an important & KDE, package. if you read this, you've probably already done it...</seg>
<seg id="1609">This section is aimed at people who compiling from source files, and do not think for users who use a pre-compiled package of their distribution.</seg>
<seg id="1610">If you are searching for assistance according to your needs, if it runs once, the following is right for you:</seg>
<seg id="1611">A program that calls for many different programs, has many variations of settings. on the best, read the step by step example to know the options and settings. it shows screen photos of different map cards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the sample.</seg>
<seg id="1612">Hello, still on reading? even if only the help menu was clicked on the initial start of the program, without any reference point such as it is going to pass from this somehow (especially if at the time of program boot does not include audio CD; in the drive), or from the unusually short menu?</seg>
<seg id="1613">What does it work? who reads this, probably the program has to start. it should look something like this:</seg>
<seg id="1614">A bad example: unfortunately no e-mail. the author can't stop this manual; it's first version for a manual to & kaudiocreator; may it be done. at least, after contact with the author. and if you read this, he has left this section and is therefore agree with this suggestion.</seg>
<seg id="1615">Strange if you managed to recover the source file from & KDE, SVN, then you don't need these information, but...</seg>
<seg id="1616">& kmid; is the MIDI- and Caraokespieler of & KDE; beside others, it has also some features that do not have other features, the other & UNIX; -MIDI players don't have.</seg>
<seg id="1617">& kmid; runs under & Linux; and FreeBSD. it builds on the OSS system, so it should work on all systems with OSS and & KDE; supports the & Linux; Ultrasound project drivers which is needed for GUS cards. Alsa is involved as soon as it supports a sequenzer.</seg>
<seg id="1618">& kmid; shows the songs on the screen with changing color, so it is easy to follow the piece.</seg>
<seg id="1619">Graphic representation of any MIDI channel by using advanced keys on the (virtual) keyboard.</seg>
<seg id="1620">Drag & drop so that you can drag in & KDE; any MIDI file from a & conqueror; -Window to drag.</seg>
<seg id="1621">Supports the two existing standards to save text in MIDI files (sonography experiences or texts). KMid determines automatically the procedure applied.</seg>
<seg id="1622">Session support. if you end & KDE, while playing a song, KMid starts again with the same song in the next time.</seg>
<seg id="1623">Supports external MIDI synthesizer, AWE, FM and GUS cards (for the latter, you need the LUP drivers and gusd).</seg>
<seg id="1624">First, you can open... from the File menu. it appears the usual file dialogue with which you can choose the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1625">You can also let a file from a & conqueror; -window will fall into the & kmid; -window will also work simultaneously with several songs simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To play a music piece, open it and assorted the button shutters in the toolbar, select the entry you play from the menu piece, or assorted the clay paste.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; one piece will start automatically, as soon as you go to the & kmid; -window. (with multiple pieces, they are added to a collection and played in one another.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">Once & kmid; one piece plays, you can jump on any spot by using the middle mouse button and drive away with the knob.</seg>
<seg id="1629">If you find that a song can be played quickly or slowly, you can change to the arrows on the left and right of the speed. to get the original speed, double-click on the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The space bar has two tasks: if one piece is played, a pressure on the empty space is played like a pressure on the knob or the exit of the menu, so the playback is played, while no piece is played, kicks off & kmid; playback.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be stored on two ways in one piece of music. some pieces use textile portrait, others use lyrics and another both. some pieces have no text: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid; you can adjust, which events will be displayed, and even better: the event type will automatically determine which a song is used, so you can't adjust the karaoke text. but you still have the opportunity to change that if you want to see the other way.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to adjust a event type, select from the menu settings the entries, texts and recitals. the same function also have the keys 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files that you summarize. these will be played through the series. in this section, how you can use the collections.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, first open the collection manager. this can be found in the menu collection under the item. Click here to New and give the name to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy a existing collection by clicking on copying and then specify the name for the new collection. this collection will contain the same songs like the original ones.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than a collection, you can set the setups on the collecting manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">In the temporary collection all the songs you want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When leaving the application, this collection is not saved. consider the if you add many pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, it must be selected in collecting manager. there you can add a song in the way. it appears again the file dialogue with which you can choose the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song, depends on the attitude of automatic add to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">If automatic add to the collection is activated, a piece of opening (using file opening or drag & drop) is automatically added to the active collection.</seg>
<seg id="1643">If automatic add-on to the collection is enabled, when opening a piece set the temporary collection is enabled, and the collection will then be added to the unopened pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you need to open the collection manager, select the collection and select the desired song and then click on button Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs will be played. if you are playing the sequence of the menu collection, the songs will be played in the order, as they added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">If you add songs or remove or accidental order in the menu, the order will be reset.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select the collection manager or use the selection list above the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To jump to song, select the button next song, the entry next song from the menu piece or press the arrow right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To jump to a song, select the button pre-piece one, the entry previous piece from the menu piece or press the arrow left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection, and click the button to delete.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection can't be deleted. however, it doesn't matter how they will not be saved when leaving & kmid;</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizers, which are non-MIDI capable. in this case the MIDI-Map General-MIDI events are translated into events that understands the synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map that converts all the events of the Change patch to Trumpet's events, making it always a trumpet snares, when originally a piano should play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you only have a soundcard, you don't need MIDI-Map because all sound cards are GM compatible (including Awe - and GUS maps, FM devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">Sorry, there is no programs to create MIDI maps. so, you need to edit the corresponding file of your hand (with your favorite movies).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI-Map is a text file, which stores all required requirements for playing a unit.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may only be released except the KEYMAP section, which often appears as desired. the requirement for this is, however, that every occurrence has different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Fins PATCHMAP... END Define KEYMAP "Name of the Keymap"... Continue reading END Define CHANNELMAP... END options... END...</seg>
<seg id="1659">They see that dephins is needed to show that a section begins (except for options) and END, that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your Map-file as an e-mail, so that I can offer in future versions of & kmid; support for devices that are non-MIDI compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section, the patches written by General MIDI to be shown to your specific keyboard. the general use will look as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are in the right order (from 0 to 127), you may not change the order and also no line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllkeysTo M is needed to put all tones that will need this instrument on the tone with the number M (GM-Patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with sound 60), which can take you like a shot, add the following in the PATCHMAP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">For example, if a MIDI file is to play a note with patch 127 (riflank), patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the tone 60, irrespective of which clay is available in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here with the term drum patch of patch included, if any sound is a different percussionary instrument (drum, cymbals, maracas & etc;), and not the one that means the pitch of the same drum means (like him some keyboards).</seg>
<seg id="1666">KEYMAP section is used to specify how to be mapped on a specific channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">Like the PATCHMAP section, the order of lines is very important, likewise the presence. you must create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define multiple Keyboards for each channel and using multiple keys only in the first row.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keyboards are mainly used to replicate sounds on the perfocus channel. check out the keynote as an example.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to view some channels on other side. if you want to replace the first and second channel, make it easy to change in the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are useful for keyboards, which have the percussion on a specific channel (General MIDI on Channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, constructed according to the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel, which is shown on the Channel N. if you use the keymap option, you will continue to change the keymap correctly in the file. if you try the ForcePatch option, all events will ignore the patch on this channel. in this case, patch x is used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch option can be useful for instance to use the perverse-patch on the perfocus channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for Pitch Bench ratio are multiplied in which proportion of Pitch Bender's events, if a MIDI file is computed with the value n, this is used with formula n * (r / 4096) and then used only. the value 4096 is used, so that in the map file is not decimal number).</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed, because GM is presenting a keyboard, which is a pitch way to play a ton higher. unfortunately, some keyboards up to one octave higher can be played. in order to try the correct value on your keyboard, you need to try a bit with & kmid; try out.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI map, just open the MIDI settings. you can find in the menu under Settings, point MIDI settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a number of piano pieces (one for each MIDI channel). you can see that sounds are just played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a certain channel. if you have changed an instrument, the button is not changed green but red, to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has (until now) shows two different views to view the played tones. you can choose the menu settings under the Point channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">Pace-LCD displays the speed, with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the pace of a song. if you can find it, a song be too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the pace, use the arrows on the left and right of the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file which contains information about how a music piece has to be played. it contains the notes, rhythm, speed, & etc. so, the same MIDI file can lead to very different results as well as two different musicians can play in very different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Well, I am able to force niemanden, & kmid; but you need to use a typical MIDI file (1: 80) and a good synthesizer. with a MIDI file you can also change the individual instruments, speed & etc. you have the control of everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binder distribution (rpm, deb) of & kmid; because & kmid; without AWE support, you need to download and install a source distribution (for example from kmid; 's home)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I would like to add a whole folder to a collection, but I don't want to add all files separately.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Login, therefore supports & kmid; drag & drop. just open the folder you want to add in & konqueror;, select all files, and drag them to the & kmid; -window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">Necessarily, activate the adjustment Automatic Adding add to the collection. otherwise, the files are added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can touch the arrow button on the left side of the Tempo- LCD to slow the playback. to restore the standard tempo you can double to the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have a & conqueror; -window with my MIDI file and & kmid; if I want to play a MIDI file (if I want to play a MIDI file) or if I want to play a file, only entered the & conqueror; -window, and select the desired file into the window of & kmid;.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you want to listen to a file, without add them directly to a collection, switch the option Automatically add to the collection, and the new; file will add to the temporary collection. opening files</seg>
<seg id="1692">Let's assume you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid. You only want to play the first file. so, select the setup of Automatically add to the collection and then open your temporary collection just like this a MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then join the B.mid and C.mid 'playback and create a collection of all three files. how do you do it?</seg>

<seg id="1709">The application window is made of so-called andockable windows. there are always the window with the central view. alternatively, there is a window with the playlist. and finally there is a information window that will be displayed only if information is recovered.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to drag the preferred connections under the menu bookmarks, but these are individual entries. if you want to create a list of entries, which should be played by each other, then you should use the category weather playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups to receive an additional hieroglyrife. if you copied an entry, his group and all his subsets of the current category will be copied and the playback starts with the attached entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' current pieces', television and long playlist can also be changed by direct editing of XML configuration files. of course, one can only do if & kmplayer /, you can easily choose from the menu View and the next processing mode. by clicking a sub-group, only the XML content will be displayed this part.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing the XML files, you must choose from the menu and select either the editing mode, or select a different category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes are lost if the processing mode is left or select a different group without delay the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">As a result of the convenience of the author of & kmplayer; some features can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation at starting and finish can be disabled by editing ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayin c and change from [general Options] No intro = 0 obiger option on '1'. if the option is not available, it can be inserted simply inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate another animation. & mmplayer; will observe the files ~ / .kde / share / apps / kmplayer / file .xml and ~ / .kde / exit.xml. format must be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation at the start does not need to be short, it will be terminated automatically by opening another source. this would be, at the end-animation, the user can therefore stop the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a start-animation can be a favorite photos: & lt; fuel; & lt; / /; bodywork; & lt; / magisted; In list tests / some examples of SMIL which are supported by & kmplayer.</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a rider to configuration of MPlayer in the configuration dialog for & kmplayer. here, the path can be adjusted from the MPlayer and the cache size of the data flow from the network and other things.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for troubleshooting is the button 'console' in the toolbar of kmplayer. here's the output of mplayer.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no rider for this rendition in the configuration dialog for & kmplayer. everything must be configured by manual edit the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayin. here is an example like a 'flash' with the module strings Mozilla with:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash 'can be played inside & mapped; you can even add the special field to YouTube in playlist XML.</seg>
<seg id="1724">In order to play the & kmplayer; 'flash' in HTML pages, the & kmplayer; module must be specified as a service provider for the Mime type application / x-Shockwave-flash in the setup dialog box of KDE.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The Konqueror or & kmplayer; can be programmed in a consoles and after error messages related to the charging of the browser module library. if no error occur here, the backend edition is within & kmplayer; (view, console, or console from the context menu).</seg>
<seg id="1726">This is always a predetermined backend for a certain Mime type (of course only if it was also determined), this must be done by manual transmissions of the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayin. for example, phonone should play all ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& kmplayer; can play TV cards manually, either using MPlayer or Xvideo (this needs kxvplayer). before TV can be configured to use the utility device and the TV channels you can manually be edited manually or the configuration file can be edited manually.</seg>
<seg id="1728">For configuring VDR (video data Rekorder) settings in the kmplayer dialog, the dialog box can be found in the settings of - &gt; Quelle- &gt; VDR- &gt; XVideo Port. there ought to be detected, of which one name has to be selected (e.g. it is PAL for Western Europe), the correct name probably contain a DVB.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since the VDR support of kmplayer can only use Xvideo (probably this type of reading of video equipment under Linux) should work properly. for this reason, the videoforlinux extension refers to the X server. for the XFree86 server, it must therefore be contained in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config).</seg>

<seg id="1761">All documents are usually divided into several elements. & Latex; encourage the subdivision of the document into the following items (part is the whole and subdivided element):</seg>
<seg id="1762">With the view of the document in the structural view, the single elements can be changed and viewed by a mouse click on the respective icon.</seg>
<seg id="1763">When creating your own & latex; files can be very helpful in the creation of your own & latex. once a DVI; file [straight unfolded file] has been created, jumps & kile; by one click with the middle mouse button in DVI; -viewing the corresponding line in & latex; source code.</seg>

<seg id="1769">When looking for the Edit toolbar, the three large-scale selection criteria should be developed into the document. the first selection field was developed for quick breakdown of the document in parts, chapters, sections,... The applicable & Latex; commands for the subdivision are:</seg>
<seg id="1770">The selection box is further available for items such as keywords, fuzzy-fish, or references. the options are:</seg>
<seg id="1771">Name: this command is used for a section, a picture or different element.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Terms: if reference is used for reference to a specified name (selection of a selection box).</seg>

<seg id="1776">The brackets according to the command\\ documentclass contain the settings for the command. setting [12pt] specifies the font. if the font is set down at the beginning, this can also be done even in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Once the above mentioned source example, the & Latex; source code must be compiled; the simplest way to this is the use of the program of construction or the button.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be stored in front of compile. & kile; for storing the storage is generated automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1779">The compilation of the document must be sought in the protocols that should be sought after the errors. when using quick construction, & eyepiece should be started automatically. if it is not the case, it should also be considered the log period.</seg>
<seg id="1780">One environment (English environment) is a text that is treated differently than the rest of the document. for example, the command\\ Begin {environment},\\ Huge and\\ end {environment) is supposed to have a different font by the font in the surroundings â (English Huge).</seg>
<seg id="1781">The changes will only be made within the vicinity (of\\ Begin {environment} until\\ end {environment}). there is no decision type (number) for children in a environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many denominations for an increase of readability and usability of the document. for example, certain fonts, grease, italized, etc. add these commands either with the command\\ end or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ Begin {emph}: this command is closed for short and long as long as long until it is closed with a\\\ {emph} or another environment. one single word in one set can be represented using\\ emph {Word}.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ Quote: created a quote in document. the quote starts with\\ Begin {Quote} and ends with\\ end {Quote}.</seg>

<seg id="1786">As soon as the assistant was entered a little text, a few adjustments that should be done better for the better readability of the document. these things ought to be a quote, some places in the fat and cursive pressure and a poem to the application to see the differences of these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed, it can be returned to Editor's editor or Ctrl Editor (the internal viewer must be closed).</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI; file created, the document may print or converted into a & PostScript; / PDF file can be converted. simply try and made fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is a straight file format (English D e V ice I nay). these files are created by & tex; or & Latex; for the readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of .dvi Edition such as printer, & PostScript; / PDF conversion or computer monitors.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For printing a & DVI; file the same steps as for creating the document (see). in the 7th step - after clicking on DVI, the document may print (if the printer is set correctly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The toolbar displays the conversion of DVI; file in other formats. once the DVI; file from the & Latex; source code was created, the conversion into wasted other formats can begin with the buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The links to the editor's direct jump from the editor to the right-to-line position within the DVI; -file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& kile; offers a corresponding attitude for all & latex; file files. only Modern of Settings can be set up in the box... tools construction.</seg>
<seg id="1794">To search the preface of search, the mouse has to be positioned in a row of the source text and then connect to pre-search on pre-search. the jump to the corresponding point in DVI; viewer is then sober.</seg>
<seg id="1795">This function in & eyepiece; used in DVI; document the corresponding & Latex; document of & kile; used and used for the corresponding line of the button. this needs to be specified & checkered; in & eyepiece; used as text editor (settings.. Editor)</seg>
<seg id="1796">Should the use of quick connection of the & DVI; viewer can not be displayed, an error may occur. if the log file is shown in the log file, or in the message window.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The log file extension refers to the error source in the source text. in the Editor, the log file will always be displayed, in which the error appears. in order to examine the faulty line, the error must be clicked on the error in the protocol, navigating immediately to the error line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Once you clicked on the respective button in the toolbar, a window will be used to choose the template for the document. the default sector is:</seg>
<seg id="1799">A document may be made from lea document either from the reason to new or the assistant to fast creation of a new document. further information are included in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">Strong users of & Latex; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents. templates can be created in & kile; created, saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, you have to create an existing & tex; - / Latex; file can be created or create a new file using existing document and selection of file template from document.</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document by file New, some character labels will be replaced by other data (e.g. name or drawing encoding). these variables can be set in settings... settings General.</seg>
<seg id="1803">In creating your own template, it is therefore necessary to know the strings of which variables are replaced:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUT TCLASSOPTIONS $$: this character string is replaced by entering the document class. typically they are used by entering a document class:\\ documentclass [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {77}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The easiest way to create a template is the use of assistants and the therefore associated items in the Editor. once the document was done thus, the following steps can be completed:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, your own template can then be selected instead of the default sector.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any & Latex; files will be created. a simple way to create a template should be searched for one on the Internet and the steps described below are described in the following steps.</seg>
<seg id="1808">They use & Kate; Kate; as internal editor. & Kate; is a text editor for programmers of reading and approach from many different types of text files (including & Latex; and & bibtex;). many settings for & Kate; can be made directly from & kile.</seg>
<seg id="1809">In order to learn more about Kate Wins & Kate. you should learn to visit the manual of Kate's book. users of & kile; you can get there directly with the reading of the chapter by Kate's chapter.</seg>
<seg id="1810">& kile; offers a very practical & latex; command reference which can be called for the program help LaTeX Reference, which includes almost all commands that can be found in & latex; use well as their syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">A double-click with printed Ctrl key to choose the & tex; meaning that this is to use\\ par\\ certified skip only\\ par to\\ par\\ certified skip.</seg>

<seg id="1815">Many assistants can be shown. this is an own kind of bookmarks within the text. this is highlighted by the shortcut of the shortcut or the last sprint. this will also be highlighted by the first input of a character.</seg>
<seg id="1816">The edit is probably one of the main aspect of using a program like & kile;. although & Kate; important functions for the writing of a & Latex; used to undertake many environments and therefore, special commands for their selection. the following commands are the following commands to choose from the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="1817">If you have a complete subsection (group of lines that contain on both sides an empty line). this advanced importance is close to spreadsheets, & Latex; -commands and all other lines of the source text, the only noticeable thing in & kile, is therewith that the bodies are separated by two empty lines.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Wanders the word under the current cursor position. this selection has also expanded importance as this command is also & Latex; commands with a white bed (\\) and a similar star (*) at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">For example, part of a part of the document can be removed natÃ ¼ rently and through DrÃ ¼ ons of the key. & Kate; offers with its own commands for a faster speed. under editing the following commands are contained in the text:</seg>
<seg id="1820">Removes a complete paragraph. the definition for a subsection in & kile; is contained in the description to edit sheets.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It was already clear that environments is a central role in & latex; therefore, & kile; for further commands under Edit environment for easy work with & latex;.</seg>
<seg id="1822">With this command, at the beginning of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly before the command to open the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1823">With this command, at the end of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the command to connect the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1824">If the cursor before or within the command of\\ Begin {surroundings} is located at the end of the environment meetings (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">When entering a lot of preachting ambient commands, this command can be lost quickly to the surrounding environment. this command is close to the most recently operational environment that will not be used for the surrounding ambient structure.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& kile; provides also special commands for the & latex; groups that are designed by clamps. on the TeX Group, some important commands are to match the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="1827">With this command, the start of the current group conversations (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the opening bracket.</seg>
<seg id="1828">With this command, the end of the current group conversations (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the peaked clamps.</seg>
<seg id="1829">When the cursor before or behind the swelling clamp of a & tex; group # is located, to the other end of the group conversations (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">When entering a lot of used groups, groups can get rid of the vast groups. this command is close to the last changed group, so the worshiped structure of the & tex; groups cannot be stopped.</seg>

<seg id="1840">When printed, the last character of the input will be removed and milled to the list. on the other hand, the list can also be resized by entering a further letters.</seg>
<seg id="1841">All commands are written with a short description of their parameters. alternatively, the descriptions are being removed, so that a simple jump to these positions is well-controlled, and the parameters will then be frozen and the parameters will then be frozen.</seg>

<seg id="1965">In the mouse click on the structural tree, the following action is possible to change the action from clicking on the structural surface using the mouse buttons.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the field of structural tree-settings, the visibility of nodes can be opened automatically when editing and how deep when changing the structural tree can be opened automatically. empty nodes are exposed to the empty areas in the text, while empty groups are found no element in which the current document was found.</seg>

<seg id="1968">Plugins can be managed by plugins. plugins are used by the third side, which can be used by each KPart-capable application, most well-known & conqueror;. when insertion of a plug-ins must be specified:</seg>
<seg id="1969">Address: the Path to the plugin if there is not at a standard place like $KDEDIR / lib.</seg>

<seg id="1971">Component in "Only-Lese" mode download: check if the plug-in is refused to load. only-leese-products must not exceed the load when this option is not selected.</seg>
<seg id="1972">Check the plugin: is this activated, then testis & quantaplus; if the requested information is correct. if the plugin is not available if the plugin at the moment is not available, but it should be installed later.</seg>
<seg id="1973">For the quantitative assessment of version 3.3, the troubleshooting are completely redesigned. Dieugger was discontinued, as well as the support for the DBG Debugger. instead, a debugger plugin concept has been implemented, which enables various implementations about plugins.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Currently only a plug-in is available, the support for the use of & gubed; inquantaplus;</seg>
<seg id="1975">The use of the debugger for a project starts with the selection of a matching debugger plugins in the project settings. using the checkbox in addition to the debugger-in selection field, specific settings can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If a project is enabled to debug, some additional elements will appear in the & quantaplus; interface:</seg>
<seg id="1977">View to the content of monitored variables is shown. usually in the left dock.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A view of all stops, with line numbers and terms are listed. appears normally in the lower Dock.</seg>
<seg id="1979">A view to view the output (as shown in HTML) of the debuggers. usually appears in the lower Dock.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the supported features of the debuggers all or part of the following functionality is available.</seg>

<seg id="1982">The counterpart to debug session Starte the session. includes the connection to debugger or terminates the mear according to the requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Sends a HTTP request to the server to initiate a debug requirement. this is equivalent to the use of a browser to watch the current document. the issue of this requirement is displayed in the view of debugger issue.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Has the debugger to begin with the implementation of the script and information on the monitored variables as well as the current printed line will be continued while the script will continue, before a debugrequirement is started, the script will start with the request.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Indicates the debugger to begin with the execution of the script, without informing variables and the current line number. if this is done, the version runs through a script, starts the execution as soon as a request is made.</seg>

<seg id="1993">Documentation of editing packages (DTEP; s) are used in & quantaplus; provide support for Markup- and scripts. its simplicity and flexibility makes it & quantaplus; a fast, user-friendly & IDE; for webdeveloper, easy to use and productive.</seg>
<seg id="1994">& DTEP; s are available in two ways, family 1, Markup Language and Family 2, the script files or the tool bar. day file contain two dates, the tag folders and the tool bar. tag folders (above the editing window), text and instructions are added to a document, as a user may ever.</seg>
<seg id="1995">& DTEP; s can be created manually (see below), downloaded or automatically created from an existing DTD. see in details for converting.</seg>

<seg id="1998">Tag folders are not a folder. they contain only the & descriptionrc; and the TagXML files. tag folders can carry the name of the open language and version, so available. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of the day XML, or not clear whether they are necessary, or not all necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible, so many users have a better insight and more information in working with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. everything about the possibilities and limits will be displayed in simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of an TagXML document. it can only contain once in a document. it can contain the definition of many tags but does not contain any element itself above itself.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The type of tags is a script. when using it & lt; attr &gt; an argument of the function. (only family 2)</seg>

<seg id="2011">Requires source = dcop, an interface and methodology. the arguments that can be passed to the method. may be empty or% tagname%, that means the name of the current tags.</seg>
<seg id="2012">A container tag that collects the elements of a list which can be grouped together. it can only occurs for an attribute description. it is a only element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Puts the position of a tags within a dialog box. this day can occur only once in a dialogue (e.g. once for each & lt; attr &gt; -day). the element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2014">There is the position and size of a field in dialogue. this day should be available for each field in a dialogue (e.g. one for each & lt; attr &gt; and & lt; label &gt; Tag). this element is empty.</seg>

<seg id="2016">There is a list of elements that end a day. this element is an element one element.</seg>
<seg id="2017">All TagXML files must begin with an & XML; Declaration begin: & lt;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and must be properly adjusted and closed.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Spaces do nothing influence, but pay attention to & & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & amp; especially in elements such as & lt; Toolbox &gt;, and & lt; text &gt; replaces no leg break, but some pieces of work would disappear.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To check the TagXML files the tools dialog above is in the top & quantaplus; -window to start and review TagXML. a further dialog will appear to follow the simple instructions.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This function is currently not available. currently, the verification takes only when charging the TagXML files in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In the following an example for a family of 1 TagXML file. this file describes the & lt; schema &gt; ELEMENT from the & W3C; & XML; schema. the filename is intended for this day XML file.</seg>

<seg id="2024">The & descriptionrc; file is just fairly simple and there is a editor accessible via DTD edit DTD settings. therefore, diedescutionrc; for a newly created & DTEP; for a newly created & DTEP; a simple & descriptionrc; should be created with the following entries:</seg>
<seg id="2025">[General] version = add 1 for & quantaplus; version & lt; = 3.1.2 and 2 for any higher version. name = DTD / / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional = The simplified name of the DTD. (HTML 4.01 Transitional). if not specified, the name is used as nickname.</seg>
<seg id="2026">A action can set with settings of actions... to be created. Click on New promotion to the same dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2027">This action is assigned shortcut. with pressing the user button you can select a shortcut table; with Kone is removed the current shortcut.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. it can be entered into detailed settings and inserted in the execution of the promotion, this text is inserted in the document on the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful action type. with the help of this action, you can change or use the document (or parts of the document). examples from & quantaplus; themselves are the quick start dialog or the various See in... actions for the (X) HTML-DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">The first must be given the name of the script and the interpreter. example: SH / home / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are permitted, it is recommended to use the% script.sh.in command line: $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / scripts in their path: $Path There are other special variable, which can be used in command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we replaced the URL of the current document. in case of a local document, file: / from the document name.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: is replaced with the PID of the current & quantaplus; process will be replaced by & quantaplus; only one instance will be installed if DCOP is used to control & quantaplus; the external script will be used by the external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">Parameters for this event, usually the filename of the current document or the path to the repository.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the above mentioned methods, a script can accept one script of & quantaplus; in the selection dialog box can be determined to send what is to the default value. possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected area of the document is transmitted to the script. the% input variable is normally useful only with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to the input, the output of the conducted application can also be redirected. there are two types of issue, to which standard edition is written; error messages can be done with the text written in the text by clicking the value of the select output:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the markup language, it is recommended to create the tags in logical groups. it is necessary to create a toolbar for each group. in any case it is not too many, therefore you can create a toolbar with the name of the market.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a toolbar is added, you must add and configure actions. choose settings.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are pretty self-explanatory. press the new action button at the bottom end of the window starts the editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill out all the necessary fields and add the day to the suitable tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete all, if the day has attributes and plan your use, activate "tag" day "when available, so that an input when using the action is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is it a real symbol. who should remember the action in conjunction with this icon? we replace it before we have trouble.</seg>
<seg id="2044">For creating a symbol no symbol that the action will be better, we will use & kiconedit; select other programs (or where else it is located in their distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; used by default 32x32 pixels, but we need 22x22. to change this, select Edit size.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created symbol does not only help you to realize what the action does, but also all other users of the & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to the day's start, I decided to create a start button as a symbol. by using green (green is mostly interpreted, rigid, further interpreted), or should, at least, a message to the user will be given that clicking on this symbol will be entered; -day in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol no longer must be connected to the action. this happens through the menu with Settings... (in & quantaplus;) and selecting the desired action. in addition to the text box there is a button, press him.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder where the stored symbol is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the user button and continue with other tags, so it gives, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some usual & quantaplus; functions for tool bar, or should set this to better overview through several separators in multiple groups. open the tool bar dialog over Settings tool bar. make sure that the desired toolbar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I want to select the separators (top left) for my tool bar. after selecting the element that should be added to the toolbar, press the arrow button to the right. this adds the element to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I want to preview a fast way to access the conqueror. I will select it and add to the tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note, as the separators support group. someone who doesn't know my tool bar couldn't believe that the & conqueror; -button is the contrary to the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested by pressing all symbols to ensure that everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Secure your desired folder. after RebeXML does not exist, it will be saved in the right folder, but your tool bar (s) should be loaded in the right folder. please adjust their tool bar (s) if a file is opened by the appropriate type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the chose extension of & quantaplus; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the script language or the formatting language which you like to do this chapter, as I describes a & PHP; documentation-tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before you start your own documentation, you could see the & quantaplus; -Repository if someone has done this already for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first, you need to search an existent documentation for the formattainment / scripts / etc; then you need to create the docrc file. the first part we will handle you to the second treat us here.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE Configuration file [Tree] Doc You = path, relative to this file, e.g. php42 / # 1, tag1, tag1, tag1, tag1, tag1 = shield 1.html pages 2 = viewed 2.html tag1 = tag1.html tag2 = tag2.html pages 2 = tag2.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The tree component defines the visible part of documentation in the document of documentation. for example, check out the & PHP; documentation is something:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE config File [Tree] Doc You = php42 / # top level element Top element = PHP 4.2 Documentation = Table of Contents = Introduction = Reflex.html... Language Reference = Basic syntax,... Basic syntax = Price synchronously .html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note that # before Getting Started and Language Reference. that shows that it is about sub-folders in the tree with its own content. there is no known border for the chess testing (except by reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the table of contents directly refers to a file (and consistent on the upper end of the module & mdash; file is displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces do nothing influence, but pay attention to & & lt; sign. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; resourcendateries are replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The content section is the range of docrc file, which is to be displayed on the design of the contextual help. for example, if writing a & PHP; text for context-use would be displayed directly. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (Context List) and file attachments.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of separated context elements that should be available (for & PHP; these are the functions of PHP & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can save your file docrc if you want to save your file to $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / doc / Quanta / doc / Quanta / doc / Quanta / doc / Quanta / doc / Quanta / doc / Quanta / doc / Quanta / doc / Quanta / doc / Quanta / doc / Quanta / doc / Quanta / doc / Quanta / doc) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation there.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that these good and it's worth going to be dealt, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. which documentation were used to be done by the & quantaplus; -community. they are not rich, but are proud to have worked with the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus; you are not alone. it is possible to share the herniated resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can send an email to friends, partners or else who will send in different places, such as DTD DTD package (DTEP) with email, tool bar buttons with email, in context menu of files and folders in the context menu and in scripts.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded to our main archive, where all the other & quantaplus; -users can be reviewed and only available when our team is considered correct and useful for the publication. to ensure a useful contribution, the source of resources is guaranteed, both for our team as well as for later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading you are asked for their private GPG keys (the Passphrase is not saved), or in the case that you can find out multiple keys, you can keep one out. in the dialogue New resource, you can stay empty, and with clicking OK the uploading can be started.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Uploading can also instantly upload the menus DTD DTD (DTEP), tool bar tool bar, and in context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, nor before installation, investigated & quantaplus; the intoxicity of the resource through examination of integrity and Significence. in case of problems and the resource is carefully signed, a message appears with the indication of the originator of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work in XML languages, which is currently not yet supported by & quantaplus; however, it can work timely, because hundreds of tag files can be needed in tagXML format. it provides the simpler way to automatically convert DTD to a DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the menu DTD charging and convert a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description which should be used. afterwards, the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Objective: the newly created & DTEP; is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! Doctype definitions: the string that appear in! doctype tag, such as HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / / www.w3.org / TR / HTML4 / loose.dtd</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine adjustment of the DTEP after conversion: if enabled, brings & quantaplus; after conversion the & descriptionrc; Editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this possibility.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus; there are some key concepts. to understand this and full use of & quantaplus; this chapter tries to talk about these fundamental concepts, without their understanding & quantaplus; little benefits to it.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus; the work area is divided into three areas: global, locally and projection. this distinction concerns a range of components in & quantaplus;</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for each, the & quantaplus; uses, available. by tool afford of promotions, everything is selected as global, in the common stock structure of various tool afford, actions and patterns will be able to secure actions and patterns in a global tree that will then be available at any user-user environment.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development aid for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and tools. local elements are stored in the user directory, so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project related elements are only available within a certain project. it can be specially designed for the files of a specific project. simply said that this is most limited size. all elements are stored in the folder's tree-tree structure and designs of all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of some major areas: the editorial window, the architectural intentions, the cartography with information and the tool bar. please beat in, and for further information about these localities.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click the carteiremark with the right mouse button to obtain a context menu with the current document, such as close the current, other or of the cardboard, jump to a bookmark or execution of CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right click in the editorial area lead to a further context menu regarding the processed document, such as basic processing steps (cut / copy / insert), processing of the file under the mouse, or open the file, when the string is called a file under the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top end of the editorial window, the makers of the Editors are currently focussing; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional masterpiece, for which a set of tool bars will be shown. in the course of further expansion of & quantaplus; the tool afford are adapted to the new functions and related user needs.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of tool bars is really easy. if they want to insert a simple day, e.g. & lt; then you can insert the data for this straight day. now you can insert the data for this straight day. if you wish to insert multiple attributes (like anchors), you can fill in a dialogue with different fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The installation views (QIT;) allow it to open and strip them in the information to & quantaplus; for files, project, sample templates, documentaries, scripts, attributes and documentary architectural prospects.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool that provides & quantaplus; provided this view shows all files in the project using the right mouse click. actions such as adding, remove, upload or delete the files from storage medium can be carried out using the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another option of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost anything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole website & etc. there are all options open.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided in three categories, depending on which connection it depends on. global templates are still available, local templates only for the respective users and templates in projects are only available in the project. more to templates are available.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you find information on the available script. the concept of integration in Global, Lokal and Project also works here. by clicking with the left mouse button there are further functions available, such as the script will be able to edit or send it with an email.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With this view, the internal structure of the active document is set. by left-clicking of an element, the cursor is set to the position of the element. by right-clicking of a Elementary, a list of commands opens in terms of navigation and collection of the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears among the other constructs. with him, managerial attributes and name rooms can change the protection of all available attributes with few clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation for web technology for your development. it can be downloaded documentation for & quantaplus; from the quantaplus; 'document site can be downloaded, and by adding a folder's doc to create project-specific documentation, edited and viewed.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus; two Cartridge at the bottom end of the window can be reached via the useful information: the message window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This map shows information about every in Quanta meta script. for example, e.g. the DTD being used for the current document and all changes to DTD.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This cardboard box shows all the error in the markup of the current document. & quantaplus; scripts that are executed, give all error messages (such as what are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantaplus; Toolbars are extensive, and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and it will receive the corresponding command. the chocolate bars of the tool bar is the possibility to define their own commands as symbols in & quantaplus;</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another feature of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a toolbar with email. & quantaplus; sends the toolbar as a compressed Tar-Archive via &-mail; if you get a toolbar in an email, you can secure them in & quantaplus; like any other backup and load!</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to customize the place of & quantaplus; files can be adapted to your system. to get a complete list of options, enter. / configure --help. the options are simple to understand and not done here.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems when starting & quantaplus; you should check whether your path contains the & KDE; 3 bin folders. also, you should make sure that no older version of & KDE; 3 in the Path before her bin folders. the same applies to & Qt.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Quantaplus; is a web development tool for the KDE surface. & quantaplus; was optimized for rapid web development and combines a well-mature development environment with a wide range of powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">During the effort to create the best & HTML editor; the developers of & quantaplus began to deal with an obvious idea: what would be if & quantaplus; an independent, extendable markup languages would be? well, this would make him an absolutely large web development tool for & KDE; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer on pure & HTML; is limited & quantaplus; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive Web development tool. together, you should define it & XML; then it should be & quantaplus; for the appropriate & IDE;</seg>
<seg id="2109">Well, to which the above claim must be noted that & quantaplus; as product is based on the outstanding efforts of the entire & KDE; it is not only possible to expand users and developers, & quantaplus; so it allows users to expand as they need for their need.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantaplus; allows web development support the use of an intuitive and powerful multi-document surface (MDI;). this can boost productivity for almost any task. by means of self-coated actions, it can be expanded & quantaplus; however, no script can notice any scripts.

<seg id="2154">& quantaplus; is a high-quality product that is freely available and freely available, but as with any open source project, developers can always use help. if they want support the & quantaplus; -development in financial form you will find here the way.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should be completed at the top of the project called the whole directory structure for the rest of the project. all these paths and author information fields can be completed later with Shift; F7 project project properties.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name to enter the project, for example foo. when entering the name, file is completed automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantaplus; project file. by default, it has the name of the project in lowercase and without spaces with the extension webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you can access the machine address of the machine, which one wants to access the one, besides one processed local data. either a name (hostname.exempl.de) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>

<seg id="2165">With this option all files and folders are displayed within the main character and you can present a precise selection of good mantle.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in the main folder. you can choose the desired files by chance or, by removing the skins, clamps from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new project assistants includes three settings to simplify your work. these settings can also instantly upload these settings in the menu of the menu in the subwindow profiles, or with the Shift shortcut Shift. F7.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings are identical to those in the project assistants and are described in detail. the additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of filenames (placeholder possible), which can be re-related to project related operations like project folder.</seg>

<seg id="2177">To open a different project, select Project... from the menu Project or the Symbol Project open from the toolbar. the Project Project will be opened and allows selecting a project. projects have .webprj as an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">If & quantaplus; closed, the project file will be stored automatically. you are asked if you want to save changes before leaving, if & quantaplus; changed files. the same happens when you invite a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project management provides free access to the files in the project. you can manage the files in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">File responds equally, however, the entries must be opened and open with... in the right button of the mouse on the right mouse button:</seg>

<seg id="2183">The password is kept in the core memory and remember program. these possibility is useful if common uploading of files needed and the rather unsafe password on the record is not listed in question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantaplus; many high-lavers profiles can be uploaded and thus the project (or parts of the project) can be uploaded to various servers. when editing or creating an profile this dialog will be displayed:</seg>
<seg id="2186">That's the client's name to be copied to files. either a fully qualified domain name or IP address work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for uploading. the list depends on the version of & KDE; and the installed Kio slaves. at least you should choose from & FTP;, file (local) and NFS.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for the transfer. usually, this must not be changed, except the network administrator managed to operate a service on the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your Angstshaft this is either a time-saving function or a risk. if your password will be saved on the plate, so that it can't be easily read, but everyone can see with programming language.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A projection view is only one set of files and tool bars. it can be used in a project many views, i.e. through a simple diving of the view, various files and toolbars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool bar.</seg>

<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus; with which one has to do most. this helps not only increase productivity, but also allow the adaptation of & quantaplus; in own working methods.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As already mentioned above, machine bends in & quantaplus; best can be stacked on the toolbar. using and adding tool bar, the tool will be treated below to add tool bars below.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The tool bar and symbols can be set either by context menu (right click on the toolbar), in which the new toolbar can be removed, tool bar renaming or tool bar can be adjusted in the dialog, where can be specified in the dialog, which can be visible on this or other toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu on a toolbar (symbol) on a toolbar, additionally the entries will be removed and action displayed, which are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The tool bar and the actions can set up in the menu with settings and set up the settings..</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are in the essential document cassette, code-Schnitzel and files to link. you can copy, move or any system available on the system existing in the previous system. templates have in & quantaplus; in about restrictions you imagine to file system.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus; provided templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions specified at the beginning of any template before use.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary is all that is not pure text. it can normally be any file except text, so pictures, & PDF; s, Flash files & etc. binary templates are normally inserted in documents through shortcuts (e.g. pictures with IMG src = / src / url). further information on templates are available.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be created by any text document. on the basis of this templates, new documents can be created. normally, a simple rumor can be found in appropriate way to save efficiently. some examples may be found under global templates. see also for more information on templates.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This kind of templates is useful if not a new document may be inserted based on a template but the same text area to be inserted again into the documents. you can find anything from a comment about a complete menu system on Javascript, or Perl. see also for more information on templates.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name suggests this templates for all websites as templates. they are a collection of different documents, which can be organized in a folder tincture at a compressed tar archives. there are currently no examples in & quantaplus;</seg>
<seg id="2203">Design a document structure according to Belgian (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;) and select the file as template. save the local template....</seg>
<seg id="2204">As soon as this is done, note that (even if it was stored as a project template) the template is not visible in the project tree. check out in the previous system of project templates.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click on File As template's selection as a local / project template. alternatively, the selection may be removed with drag and off on the template templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: copy file only in a folder folder. it can be used for all file management functions, such as pulling, and insert on the file tree from Konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">One can click on the file tree or in the project files Building view to a folder on the right and backup to secure a name for the template and secure. by default, it can be stored as a local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates permit a very well-oriented approach. you can create headlines and footlines, or transform files or linking. in addition, some things can keep some things using templates in projects very deep breath in the eye.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The deposit structure in the subwindow templates is based on the files contained in $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / templates and $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / templates. each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers, such as above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To define the behaviour of a folder with the right mouse button, click on the folder and choose the menu menu. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection box with the three previously described types; files, text or templates. this selection is blown, as soon as the attributes is distorted.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is activated by default and fits all except the root folder. if a root folder would be set in principle, unless it would be explicitly enabled, if it would be explicitly enabled. in case of a normal folder, the blah would appear with something like text building. if nothing appears, there is probably in a trigue.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows a set or tested text for templates in this folder. this could be general headlines or footlines for all templates for a particular project and allows to equip all templates to a folder with special headlines / footlines a whole presentation already with the appropriate headlines / footlines.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, using context menu (pressing the right mouse button) on a full command collection for adding folders or copy and add templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">With two modes: VPL; Editor and VPL; & Source Editor, which can be reached via the menu View. the first mode replaces the source editor in two parts: the source editor and the VPL; Editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; Editor works as follows: it will load a document such as a normal & HTML; - or XHTML; -page and a cursor. then you can edit and see if necessary to source code editor, in which the changes carried out in the source code can be visible in the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; editor in a document, the & PHP; contains a small green symbol of Vohandated by & PHP; source code. it is not possible to edit this directly with the VPL; Editor's source code. there are no plans to change these behaviours.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works exactly as the first, except for the changes both in the source editor and in the VPL; Editor is already active and the cursor in the source Editor is already active, the button transfer the active cursor from a window to another, whereby the position is retained in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronization distance between the VPL; Editor and the source editor can be adjusted via Settings Quanta. in addition, the recommendation can be set automatically between synchronization after one click or automatically. in the selection, the recommendation: a small range for fast computer and a large range of slow for slow motion.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Suppose you want to change the title of the website, so it is possible to select the documentation of invisible tags when working with the VPL; Editor is also called, as soon as a new document is created with the VPL; Editor is designed to change the suspension of the hands. this means that you can change the following:</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta-Tags allow storage of information about the document themselves e.g. percussions for internet search engines. meta-elements can be added to the list below. one click allows changing the inhaltes, e.g. key keywords on the column name and keyword keywords on the content column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way of design in the browser. you can add CSS rules using buttons under the list or delete. a change over the list is possible exactly as in the meta-elements. the editing of CSS rules is currently not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to insert an external CSS style translation by clicking on the file button and select the appropriate file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The use of cursors is as illustrated in a text processing, thanks to the arrows, possible. under rare circumstances, the cursor works perfectly. text can be inserted as usual. text can be inserted by typeward or deleted by return or distances.</seg>
<seg id="2225">The insertion of tags will be done in the same way via the toolbars, such as in the source Editor, e.g. if an anchor-day has already been removed if an anchor tag, encircled with text, each other housing must be removed each day.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some tools such as the tables assistant or the lists are disabled. you will be able to work in & VPL; later, tables or lists must be used in this release.</seg>
<seg id="2227">& xsldbg; is a tool for investigation of styles. in contrast to other programs for style, the search for certain elements is possible and the execution of stilettlement can be persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2228">In order to compile & xsldbg; we need to compile, except & KDE, the libraries of libxslt, libexslt and libxml, which are already present in a typical installation of & KDE.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Stop in a template, placed in a place in an area of xsldbg loaded styles or xml file or at the current node. new to xsldbg 3.1.4: in gdb compatibility mode, you can set points in a specific file and line number and later enabled.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools for the same. why so & diff3;? let me briefly explain why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merger was very complicated because one of the contributions made many changes and simultaneously on many places the entries had been corrected. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file. the result were numerous conflicts in bringing together.</seg>
<seg id="2283">That's the program used to me only the changed lines, but I could not see what exactly had changed within these lines. and there was no indications of the positions, where perhaps only the inclusion of these changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">That was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could display differences within one line and changes to white characters. later, a lot of more useful features were added later.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to compare fast text, copy it simply into the clipboard and add him in one of the comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function which made a lot of work was the publishing and merge of folders. this feature turned & diff3; almost into a full file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-way contests will be fully supported. this is useful when two persons can work independently from each other on a piece of Code and show simultaneously the dissolving result. in this editor, you can even edit the result. in this editor, you can even directly edit the result. the screenshot shows three quell files at the collision:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; helps you complete the same and condominate folder. this screen photo shows & kdiff3; in the folder assembly:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& low diff3; shows the exact differences and is based on how to check the opportunities today's color monitors. if you often have Code, you'll like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white characters and tabulators are visible. if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters, you can see it at a glance at the Summary in column at the left side. (no nuger more, if any one changes the influence.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is equal, and the other is different in one line, then the color indicates that the file is different. red color means that both files are different.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files are in the same name, but in different folders, you can make the typing work completely by using the filenames of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Diff3 Folner1 folder 2 folder Title 3 Folder 1 folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 folder folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">The opening dialog makes it easy to select filenames file names, select the selection above the file-browser (file...) or the selection of a last opened file on the next time. you don't need to specify a third file; if you do not leave the entry for C empty, the analysis of the differences are carried out with two files.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Via the button folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the same or merge of folders will be selected, for B and C, however, select a folder, then uses & diff3; the filenames consisted of A in the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">If merging is crossed, the input field is active for the target and can process it. however, it is not necessarily necessary to set immediately an output file. you can even do this step later when saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The set knob opens a dialog with settings. here you can set options before using the same / merge operation.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you would like to compare text of a text, but only parts of a text. & diff3; allows you to select text parts from the clipboard into the active comparison window. the opening dialog will need to select any files, you can simply connect the dialog with the shutdown button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use drag and finish: just drag one file from a file manager or selected text from a editor and let it fall over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">What idea is behind it? sometimes, a file e.g. contains several similar functions. if you want to figure out similar files, it would like to load two corresponding files, it would then compare and compare it. now, you can easily copy the relevant sections, add and then compare it.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently, you can do anything from a diff3; only out the case of text in a comparison window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the drag and lay text into another program as cut and insert (instead of copying and insert). in such case, your original data may be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">In the upper part of each text window, the Info line contains the characters A, B or C, the filename and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (if the path comes to a file, leave the mouse a while on the line. then a small relief window will show the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source windows are assigned to letters A, B and C, and the colour is blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these settings can be changed over the settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">If a difference is detected, one can differ at the color, which is different files, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in settings). the color scheme is especially useful if you compare three files. this is clearly visible in the next section (merge).</seg>
<seg id="2306">Links to the text is the summarised column. if differences were found, the column shows the appropriate color. with some programming languages the white characters is not so important to see the relevant changes. (at C / C + + e.g., white characters is relevant only in strings and comments, for the preprocessor and in few, rare cases relevant.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line which separates the summarization column from the text, where the source file has no lines. if the line orbit is enabled, the line will be shown on broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The pane window (below the comparison of comparison) has also an Info line with the wording edition:, the filename and [changes] if you have revised the result. usually, it contains the automatic compilation with text, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all disputes occur, the deposit is disabled!!! (use the buttons to ableak / unsolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two reference windows is used, any difference at the same time has to be replaced manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By one click with the left mouse button in one of the windows, the group is highlighted in all windows, where the first row is highlighted in the windows, where the first group is highlighted in the windows. it is then highlighted by the color background color for current section and on the left is a black beams.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes it remains in the box or by manual edit any other line more in the group; it is displayed only in these lines. this text appears neither in the final file, nor in a mark which you may copy and somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; summarizes; however, in the clipboard, if you copy such a text from the spring window. carefully go carefully with this feature.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: if when selecting the sources you want to ignore the options below or Ignoriere C / C + + comments, changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">This will navigate mainly to the images and mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you are in one of the windows, you can use the arrow keys on, right, end, string column next to the vertical frame outlet, and you can also click on navigation use.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the eye window, you can also use the other buttons to edit. using the insert button, you can change between plugging and overdrive mode. (default is the one-set mode).</seg>
<seg id="2317">One click with the left mouse button in one of the summary columns synchronizes view of all windows in the beginning of the respective group (as already in the context and the editing output window was explained).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The tool bar contains seven buttons to navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference (Ctrl-down / Strg-pickled), to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-down / Ctrl-pickled) or to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-down / Ctrl-picture). therefore, all non-dissolved conflicts should also be regarded as a conflict. therefore, between soluble and unresolved conflict.</seg>
<seg id="2319">In order to copy the marking into the clipboard, you need to copy the copying button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl-insertions). if this option is activated, you will automatically mark anywhere in the clipboard. if this option is careful, but you might be able to see the content of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Zeiling will be stored in accordance with the underlying operating system. UNIX variants use a line-up menu\\ r\. KDiff3 retains the caching of the source files, therefore you should use & diff3; also do not use binary files.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and the list of files used are automatically saved and recovered during the next start. (menu setting up &gt; KDiff3...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Select a font with fixed width. (on some systems the dialog features variable width to choose from, but you should not use it.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you activate this option, differences in cursive script will be displayed. if the selected writing does not support this representation, nothing happens.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors could not be available in their pure form, but would be fixed. on these systems, the button will automatically provide an unjust colour.</seg>
<seg id="2325">If this option is enabled, the number of tabulator button is inserted the corresponding number of spaces. otherwise, a tabulator-character will be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">When entering or return returns, the entry of the preceding line will automatically be used for the next row.</seg>
<seg id="2327">When this option is enabled, each selection will be copied automatically into the clipboard, then copying the manual into the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can choose which type 2 type you prefer to store. the default value is the commonly used choice on the used operating system.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In the same time, the files tried & diff3; first, all fully identical lines can be found in the source files. in this step, white characters are not ignored. in this step, white characters will not be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) save a cart ride '\\ r' and a line thrust '\' at the end of a row, but then you could save files with different sizes in side-to-side comparison, but how this option has to be disabled, but this option has to be deactivated. in default, this option is deactivated.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In default, this option is deactivated. in the first part of the analysis, numbers and related characters ('0' - '9', '-') are ignored. the differences are nevertheless displayed, but they will be treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2332">In default, this option is deactivated. changes in comments are treated as changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intense after even smaller submissions. option is enabled in the default. it is effective in complicated and large files, but slowly at very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In automatic further jump mode, this setting, how long will the result of the selection will be displayed, before the next post-next conflict will continue.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Dissolves automatically every conflicts in white characters as a source. (preset is manual selection.) It is useful when white characters occur less in time. if you only use the automatic selection of conflicts in numbers or comments when the options are ignore in numbers or comments when the options are ignore or Ignoriere C / C + +.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are described in Chapter for scanning of folders and execute a merge tool. check out for details on documentation for directory comparing and merging.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is stored, and already an older version exists, then the original version is the Suffix .original file, if already a backup file with the Suffix. original exists, it will be deleted without additional backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Adapts the language of the user interface. changing the current program does not refer to the current program. you must finish & diffuse, so that the change is active. (this option is not available in the KDE version of & diff3; not available because the language will be adjusted globally via the control centre.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following coefficients settings can be set separately for each entry. if you activate this option, the following settings will be used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">About the selection fields for coding is a short note that is the local coding. (this can't be changed here and has for you purely informal character.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file coding for source files. this affects how special characters are treated and interpreting. as the coding for each file can be adjusted individually, even files can be compared and stored.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have a file, you can define which coding for store are to be used.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define pre-processing command, they could not work with your codec. (for example, your files can do 16-bit ASCII, but the preprocessing command can only deal with 8-bit ASCII.) Using this option, you can designate the coding of the output of pre-processing command.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Turn this off to suppress the modifications of changes in white characters in text or crossings. (note: this applies also for changes in numbers or comments when the options are ignore or Ignoriere C / C + + comments.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available when you compare three files. however, you may only see the differences between two of three files. after selecting from A & lt; B, A & lt; C or B & B; C will be displayed in addition to normal data column with the required information.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you would like to use the available square on the screen for long lines. simply use the less important window. (this option is located in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">The comparisons prepared to each other or over each other. this can also be useful to display long lines. (this option is located in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes, you consider the differences and decide to compile the files. a simple click starts to compare the file recovery and use the filename for the last source file as default for the output file. (if this function is used again, then the name of the last used output file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file it will pass first to this external command. in & kdiff3, then the output of the command is visible, and not the file itself. you can use your own preprocessor. you can use this function for example, or correct parts or correct it.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file it is given first to this external command. if also, a normal operating system command was applied (see above), then the output of command is used only in line spacing. you can write your own preprocessor that corresponds to your requirements. each input line has to have one corresponding output line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind that user is more flexibility when inserting the diff results. however, a external program needs to program, and most users would like to program the good news. however, the good news is that in most cases SED or Perl.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this preview processing command for line spacing for input in large letters: SED's /\\ (. *\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other versioning control systems use some key words (info: / cvs / Keyword substitution). all will follow the same pattern $\\ _ BAR _ run\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you experiment with SED, you might be able to understand and perhaps you like this regular expressions even. they are very useful because there are many programs which support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">The noignored of numbers is actually a built-in function in KDiffusion. but it is good as an example of a further processing command for line space.SED's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Each character will be replaced by nothing, so it's deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform more requirements at one time. then you can use the Semikolon '; use them to separate the conditions. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of SED you can also use some other such as Perl. Perl -p -e's / REGEXP / replacement / switches' allerdings are needed with Perl. where SED\\ (and\\) are needed, with Perl only (and) without the preceding '\\'. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data according to the normal preprocessor are retained for the ad and to carry out. the other surgeries change only the data that the line spacing is equal to Algorythmus.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases if you use a normal processor, the line spacecraft provides the output of the normal resistive processor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The preprocessor commands are very useful but like in any function, the text changes or differences hidden, you can't notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often, programmers need to edit many files in a folder. you can compare and assemble complete folder with a diff3; whole folder.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... for each object a proposal to merge: you can customize the proposal before the start,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate the simulated changes, simulates the simulated changes without interrupting them,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... leads selected actions either with all (F7 key), or just using the selected objects (F6-key).</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is the same and merge of individual files very similar. you must just specify a folder on the command line or in the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">When three folders will be merged, folder 1 will be used as a basis. if no target folder is specified, uses & diff3; folder as target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts, not the assembly to start, select the corresponding menu entry or press the F7 key. (further details will follow.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">During the reading of the folder you informs about a small news window over current progress. if you loose the folder's scan, only the files are listed that are compared until then.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When the scanning of the folder is complete, shows & diff3; a list window with results on the left,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and any folder that was found during the scan is displayed here in a tree. you can choose an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder tincture is usually folded up. you can double click on the + / - click on the object button or use the arrow keys for left / right. the directory menu contains two features All types of subdirectories and all subdirectories can be folded up or folded.</seg>
<seg id="2372">If you double click on a file, the file is started immediately and a comparison window appears.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The symbol in column Name reflects the file type in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different to the other folders, this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detailed windows to the selected object. in such case, the collision action cannot be automatically selected. if the assembly run, you will be informed about problems of this kind.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As in the above picture is visible in the columns A / B / C the colors red, green, yellow and black.</seg>
<seg id="2376">Identical entries, the color is also identical, even if the age of the entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders will be considered as identical if its entire content is identical. then folder the same color. at folder, the age is irrelevant for his color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea to this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colours reflects the colors of a sheet again, which is only green, then yellow and later when it is old, red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C identical but not B: copy B (or if B does not exist, delete the target, if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical but not C: copy C (or if C does not exist, delete the target, if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C identical but not A: copy of A (or if A does not exist, delete the target, if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C does not have the same file type (e.g. if a file and B a file is): error: contradictory file types. as long as such objects exist, the assembly can not be launched.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B does not have the same file type (e.g. if a file and B a file is): error: contradictory file types. as long as such objects exist, the assembly can not be launched.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The mode for synchronize is active if only two folders and no exportite target folder, and if the option directories are synchronously active. then choose the desired action, that the following folder may be identical. if for an entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist yet, but not identical: together, and save the result in both folders. (the user looks as the visible file names for the output file only B; copied directly after merging & diff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">If two folders will be merged and select the reset file instead of merge (unsafe) if the files are different, but the date is identical.. While such errors are not removed, the folders will not be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">As a result of a file, you will perform a file according to the other. if the merge operation was successful, and according to other reports, if something unexpected occurs, you should try out a final review and see whether the status is everywhere in order.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If in the setup dialog box is selected to view the file size of a Complete analysis, KDiffusion is deleted, no white and white conflicts. (the column for solved conflicts is only displayed if three folders can be compared or compiled.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either set up the just selected entry (file or odds) or all entries on once. if you have selected all collision actions (even in all submissions), you can start the collision.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you have no target folder, then the Three-file-merge mode C will be used as a target, when two-folder will lead the B as a goal and synchronization as a goal and / or B is used as a target.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you select a target folder, check out whether all entries must be displayed in the target folder, even in the folder folder. there are some options to be skipped with specific entries. check these options to avoid unnecessary surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To compose all entries: select list compasses / continue in the directory menu or press F7 (the shortcut table). in order to compress only the current entry, select the current element and press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If the contradictory file types still exist, a message appears that shows incorrect elements, a message appears that you can then select a valid promotion.</seg>
<seg id="2394">If you merge all entries, a dialog window appears with the options, sliulate and break down.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Select simulate if you would like to see what would happen, without which truly changes would be made. you will then receive a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then guide certain actions with all entries. if a manual procedure is necessary (summarizing a single file), then a merge window will open (note the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">If you are finished with a file, you will start again / continue or press F7. if you are still not saved, a corresponding dialog appears. then the diff3 will continue with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If & diff3; on an error, a message appears and detailed status information. at the end of the list, you will see some error messages that can help you to select the cause of the problem or to solve the problem in any way before you proceed to the problem.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If there were some entries individually, notice & diff3; these entries (in the current session) and will result in the future together all entries. even if the assembly run has been carried out or not saved, these entries will be done as settled. only if you change the merge action, these entries will be merged again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The settings menu of & kdiff3; (menu settings - &gt; KDiff3...) now has a section called directory merging with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that are shown on the specified pattern, are displayed in the element tree. separate samples can be entered with a semicolon;. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). the default file must not correspond to this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be used as a pattern. the semicolone can use the semicolon; as a separator. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. preset is * .original; * .O.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be used as a pattern. the semicolone can use the semicolon; as a separator. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. preset is * .original; * .O.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignore files that are also ignored by CVS. many autonomous files are ignored by CVS. the great advantage is that this folder can be set with an .cvsignal file. (please refer to info: / cvs / cvsignor.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file systems you have a default attribute. in other file systems it marks a leading point. this option lets you decide whether these files are displayed in the element tree or not. this option is switched on in default settings.</seg>
<seg id="2406">For links to files: if the option is switched off, symbolic intersects compared. if the option is turned on, the files are compared to which the links are disabled. this is deactivated in default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">For links to file: if the option is switched off, the symbolic links are comparably. if the option is turned on, the links such as normal folders will lead and recursively reviews. (note that the option contains a link to itself, would lead to a folder and write & diff3; crashes down.) This option is shut down in default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">A full analysis of each file carries out the statistic columns. (the number of dissolved, non-white and white conflicts.) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and significantly slower, if it does not contain any text. (specify an appropriate anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare big folders through a slow network, it may be possible to compare only change date and file size. however, this speed advantage will cost you with caution. this option is used in default.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to confidentiality date. no real comparison instead. the files are considered as identical if they have lost comparison, if in copying the date of notice lost. please do not use caution. this option is used in default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activating the synchronization mode if two folders are compared to and no target folder. in this mode, the proposals are being identical to both folders. also the results of the files are stored in both folders. this option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, the copying of the newer file will be considered as action. (this is considered insecure, because the other file is not changed too. you should check this in any case.) This option is shut down in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folder is replaced by a different file, then the original version is renamed and will receive the extension .original If an old backup file exists with the .original file, this will also include files without backup. this option is turned on by default. this option is switched on in default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally, the folders can be seen in combination of individual files; you can shift the window part with the mouse. if you don't want to switch the window in the window menu and switch the window in the window menu and switch between the two views between the two views.</seg>
<seg id="2415">Probably, you prefer to compare a file just by double click. however, you can also install a single file directly in the directory menu. once you can store the file, the status will be done automatically and the file will not be merged again if you run the folder.</seg>
<seg id="2416">However, this status is lost, if you read the list here: list -Menu: new</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparent with the help of KIO slaves. KDiff3 uses this to read files and folders. in this way you can specify files and folders to open, which are on local or remote computers.</seg>

<seg id="2419">A URL has other syntax for local files and folders. a few things should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relatively unowned or.. containing URLs are not possible, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be tracked. (# - &gt;% 23, idle &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file named / # foo # the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the file system based on the server, sometimes through the protocol. it follows a short list of limitations:</seg>

<seg id="2424">There is no way to edit permission or change of change. therefore, the authorization or change date from the original. (note the option for confidentiality of the size.) (This is only possible in local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose of processing is currently the differences in KDevelop. KDevelop starts first ever the built-in differences. in order to start KDiffusion, press the right mouse button on the differences and then select In KDiff3Part from the context menu.</seg>

<seg id="2431">You have probably compiled the program from the sources and the configure script would not find the right prefix to KDE. in default, KDE will not find resources for user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you can find more information on this subject.</seg>

<seg id="2433">The editor will notice for any difference in the files where he starts and where he ends. this important information is lost, if the result is simply stored as text file and it is too much effort to create an own file format that could save this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort for this was so far too big. you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C. to create greater amounts of text, another editor should be used.</seg>

<seg id="2447">Only entries are displayed only to the differences. this also causes them to be copied to the target folder. if the target file does not have to be copied to the target folder. if the target file does not have changed to the target folder. (the behaviour is probably modified in a later program version.) This option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons to choose the source with the label A, B and C below the menu bar. if you click on one of the buttons, the lines are attached to the end of the selected group in the pane window. if the lines are already present, they will be removed when clicking on the button.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In default, this option is deactivated. underlines in individual characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated like differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & kpager; shows a Minipreview of all virtual work surfaces. it is quite practical to alter the ongoing programs on the work areas to modify their size or move them. this works in a work area than even at several.</seg>

<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window to full size of the working area. only if on an application was clicked on.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sends the application to selected virtual workspace. only if on an application it appears.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this check box is selected, window can be shifted within the & kpager; s with the middle mouse button on the Desktop and also to other workspaces.</seg>

<seg id="2462">Here the arrangement of the & kpager; the main window can be known: classic & kpager; such as Pager applications appear in some other window manoons; horizontally shows all virtual working areas in a horizontal number, which is very good for the presentation at the side of the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & kpager; can be used as an alternative to the Pager mini program in the control strip. it has the advantage that it can display in size as symbols or with their content and relocating it outside the control panel.</seg>

<seg id="2481">& kmag; is a very powerful application that is constantly expanded to include new functions. it is optimised for use on weak devices.</seg>
<seg id="2482">If you are & kmag; a window appears as shown above. the main window is classified as a magnification window. in the following window, this window will be displayed as a magnification window. the image, which is displayed in the magnification window, is called an enlarged area of the screen and is described in the following as the selection dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2483">In the standard settings are increased & kmag; the area around the mouse hand like an moveable magnifying glass. alternatively, you can display & kmag; includes a selected screen range in the magnification window (selection level mode) or the environment of the mouse counter on the screen (eg; on the left screen of the screen).</seg>
<seg id="2484">If you want to avoid the mouse indicator in the enlarged window, select the mouse cursor in the enlarged window. please note that the mouse is not able to recognize the form of the mouse. this is always the default KDE; / Qt; mouse cursor.</seg>
<seg id="2485">In the selection window mode, you can adjust the selection window to your own needs. you can move it up with the arrow keys and change its size. this can be done in the following ways:</seg>
<seg id="2486">Move the mouse into a magnification window and hold the left mouse button, so you can move the contents of the magnification window and move them with the arrow keys.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If you additionally, press the & Shift; check or use the & MMB; you can move the select window.</seg>

<seg id="2497">& kmousetool; emulates a mouse click on the same spot as soon as the mouse cursor a while on the same place. it is thought to help people who suffer from RSI syndrome (repetitive strain infected syndrome) and to which each mouse click pain.</seg>
<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulates a mouse click on the same place. it is thought to help people who emulate a mouse click on the same spot. however, you can emulate the mouse with the mouse. however, this requires a little exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool. can handle the pain that occurs in order to use the mouse, and helps so many people to assemble the computer without pain. do you suffer pain that are using the use of your computer, you should consult a physician, unless this has not happened yet.</seg>
<seg id="2500">In order to make it even clearer: even if & mousetool should prevent pain, which are caused by clicking with the mouse, it is useful against pain that are caused by loading of mouse, use it. and as with all the ergonomic accessory, the result can fall to each other.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movement and leads a mouse click, once you break the movement shortly.</seg>
<seg id="2502">If the smart transfer is activated, it is emulated & kmousetool. now move the mouse, wait until the end of movement, before moving the mouse button. in this way you can move the pulling in with pressing mouse button. the intelligent move requires a little exercise, but you get it quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">After the end of the mouse movement, this boring time has to be stalled before & kmousetool; a mouse click brings out.</seg>
<seg id="2504">If Intelligenus is switched on, the rotation speed is set (1 / 10 s). this is set the time set, the & kmousetool. after shutdown the mouse button is waiting before it takes place, if there is no problem due to the mouse.</seg>

<seg id="2506">When the sound is delayed, you can move & KDE, to move the response time. open the sound time, select the sound system and here the tab. there is a slider sound buffer to reduce the response times in order to reduce the response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting is marked, it will be launched & kmousetool. at each start of & KDE, this feature is currently only under & KDE, available. at GNOME or other window divisions, please refer to the corresponding documentation, how to start a program automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Put all settings on the values back when opening the dialog. have already pressed the button on the user, the settings will be reset to the user.</seg>
<seg id="2509">Best you use & kmousetool; initially with default settings. in particular the intelligent move should not be switched off at first. if you are getting used on automatic mouse, you can later use the intelligent shift.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it is necessary to reduce the response times of & KDE, if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2511">At first, you should make a mouse click on what is a mouse click without effect: clicking on the neutral components of windows or on positions within the browser window that doesn't display any link. you can therefore park your mouse on such places until you want to use them again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">If your mouse is moving, you should clean your mouse. it is normally quite easy. the trick is that you don't just clean the mouse, but also the rolls that are in contact with the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First you need to remove the mouse hemisphere. like this happens, is from mouse to mouse, but it should be clear when you can view the bottom of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you would have to see the reels. these are on the sides of the Loches which the ball was used. dirt and dirt. you can easily scratches the ball.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations the operating system interrupts the design of & kmousetool. if you're in this case the intelligent remote control unit, means that & kmousetool is not able to terminate the operation anymore by using the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This is done if you are using & kmousetool; using a different window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem exists that you can run a single click. this is the status of & kmousetool; reset and you can work as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, tries & kmousetool; continue to carry out mouse clicks and put the cursor in a different place.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor there where you want to make it. however, you can't find the mouse on a neutral area of working area, if you need a key mouse click on a neutral area of the mouse, the gray surfaces around the tool bar and menus and the cover lines of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with an intelligent shift, but I do not create it to edit text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The smart transfer is a advanced function of & kmousetool; and it needs its time before you want to move it into the clipboard, to move it into the clipboard. but it will probably be possible to prepare for any other action. but there will be some problems for them. here are some advice:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Don't use the smart slide if you just start to start & kmousetool; click on the end of the text area a mouse click, while you move the mouse button to the other end of the text and put the mouse button on the other end of the text.</seg>
<seg id="2523">You can use the audible mouse click. this way, if & kmousetool; the mouse button is played like a mouse click. you can just know when using the smart transfer time. later, you can use the smart transfer without the audible click. but it requires some exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To use & kmousetool; you can use the XTest extension for & X Window; it should be installed at most of the system.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible clicks is only available when the system has a sound card and loudspeaker system and are set up correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; used the mouse button as soon as the mouse has been painful soon. this program was developed for people who suffer from RSI Syndrome and to whom the firm's firm has been prepared pain.</seg>
<seg id="2527">& kmousetool; can also be configured for a specific time that a pulling process begins, before the mouse is left off. in this way, the mouse can also be carried out and off with the mouse.</seg>

<seg id="2839">This section may not replace more information about IP networks. in this appendix only basic information about the integration of the PC in a small (home) network.</seg>
<seg id="2840">Currently, IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv5 has never been able to spread. IPv6 is expected to pass through the near future. this description therefore focuses on the common IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is to assign the IP address of a network interface. in foreign networks, am & eg; the network administrator can be used or if available, DHCP can be used, if your IP address can be easily configured to any case!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When using a specific small (home) network, the IP address should be selected from an especially suitable for this purpose to avoid IP address flickering with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded to the Internet, therefore any use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the Internet for such machines can be made by setting up one Gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks usually addresses addresses in the range from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254. the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask is usually set to 255.255.255.0, so all the computers are in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the Second the loopback address (localhost = the own machine). the default route is required for the IP resline.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The 127.0.0.1 network address is reserved for IP traffic in local own machine. usually, the address 127.0.0.1 is an own so-called loopback interface which works like a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">In this part, the configuration files that are listed by & knotconf; they are affected and stored in the various distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file can sometimes be dynamic in DSL connections, so it is not surprised if in the event of active DSL connections there is another content as specified.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& dat; is a fuse for tape drives on the basis of tar. it also offers the opportunity to create multiple archives on a band. the second goal was to answer a question that asked my wife: how much longer lasts until you are secures?</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a band can be used, it must be done by & dat; it can happen on three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& dat; board the band back and read the prestressing of the band. recognizes & dat; the spell on the band will not be asked if the band is being formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Recognize & dat; if it is searching for the appropriate index on your disk. can't this be found, you will be asked if the Bandindex is to be created.</seg>
<seg id="2897">Everything has been smooth, changing the symbol for the tape drive, to display that the tape was mounted. in the status bar there is a corresponding message. the content of the band can now be searched for the tape.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before the throwing of the belt, first the integration must first be solved. there are three methods to apply this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">Dat, by changing the symbol of symbol for the band, you can realize that the integration for the band was solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar. the band can now be cast without any danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a band of & kdat; can be used, it must be formatted by & dat;</seg>
<seg id="2901">A band types must be formatted before you can order to save data. this procedure must not be formatted before using & dat; this process can usually be formatted by the band of & kdat. floppy disk drives do not require a formatting of the band preference, DAT drives on the other hand.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the band called and the capacity, goes down & dat; with the formatting of the band. all data on the band is lost automatically! after completion of the formatting process, the volume is tied automatically and is ready to use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you ascending the backup process, you must select the required files. that can happen on three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in local file tree. only this file or folder will be secured.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Mark a fuse profile in tree. they are only backed up to the files specified in the profile.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Select files in local file tree with a hammers. only the selected files and / or sub-folders are secured.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Click with the right mouse button on the local file tree and select in the menu of Sichers...</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup was initiated, the dialog opens up for backup. in this dialog, you can try to check the selected files and change the settings for backup.</seg>
<seg id="2909">If you have confirmed the settings, the dialog appears. the dialog shows the progress of the backup process including the data rate and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Select a file or folder in one of the files in the entry for the drive. only the selected file or folder will be checked.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Select the files in one of the files in the entry for the band with a hematcher. only the selected files and / or sub-folders are examined.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Click with the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu entry....</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the test procedure was started, the dialog for Settings - Check the dialog. in this dialog you can check your selection and change the work folder for the review.</seg>
<seg id="2914">If you have confirmed the settings for checking the review, the dialog box appears. this dialog shows the progress of the review process as well as data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before you can manage the restore, the files must be recovered. this can be done on two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in any of the archives created for the tape drive. only the selected file or sub-folders will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select the desired files from any of the archives with a tick. only the selected files and / or sub folders will be restored.</seg>

<seg id="2919">Once the restore process was started, the dialog for Restore. in this dialog, you can check your selection and edit the workfolder for restoration.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Once you have set the settings for restoration, the dialog appears to restore. this dialog shows the progress of recovery process as well as data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it is necessary to reproduce the indexural file from the tape. this process will delete all existing indexing files for this band. you can rebuild the index on two types of the band:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This is a backup profile with the just selected files and the default settings. you can set the following settings for a backup profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current folder, in which the backup should be made. the list of securing files will be updated automatically according to the selected working folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all folders that are listed under the backup files that are only backed by the file system that are located on the same file system, such as the folder. folder that are on other file systems you can enter separately under backup files. each entry is considered by tar regardless of the others.</seg>
<seg id="2925">To determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is used since the last incremental backup. only the files that have since changed since then.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file which is used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Delete the snapshot file before the call of tar. this causes that all files will be backed up and created a new snapshot file for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of buttons files & gt; and lt; lt; files were not fully implemented at the time of compilation of this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">Settings can set the settings over the menu item KDat... in the Settings menu. the following settings can be provided:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The complete path to device file for the belt drive (normally / dev / Tape). this path must be transferred to the non-rewinding version of the belt.</seg>
<seg id="2931">If this setting is active, transmitted & dat; before the band is bound, the command is going to load on the drive. with some drives can be done before reading and write operations.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is switched on, try & dat; it is possible to lock the belt's dropouts. possibly, this setting is not working on all tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is switched on, the lineup of the integration of & kdat; automatically ejected the tape. use this option not on Floppy Streamers.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is switched on, try & dat; not all drives support variable block size. no matter whether this setting is active or not, you have to carry out & dat; in any case the block size for your tape drives share.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & dat; a band formatted, it sends a file to the beginning of the band. this file should only take a memory block on the tape. the contents of the file is composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n Byte) The band-ID. the format of this string is computer name: second, whereby computer name is formatted on which the band is formatted. seconds, the number of seconds, which has passed since the epoch, has been formatted by the band.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band-ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $HOME / .kdat /.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The remaining files on the band are pure tar-archives created directly with & GNU / - tar. even other tar versions should work so long as it is not an incremental fuses.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Check the contents of a backup folder. this icon is only active if a band is involved.</seg>
<seg id="2940">& kslog log; is a & KDE; viewer for system protocols. the program is reserved for inexperienced users where you can address information about your system or where the system enables you to access the various protocol files. furthermore, the system allows quick access to quick access to information about problems that occur on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& kssetup log; helps to understand what your computer makes in the background. the program is a simplified picture of the protocol files of its own system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users where you can receive information about your system or where the system is stored for the various protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, it enables improved users to provide quick access to information about problems that occur on their server. & ksystem log; tries to provide some expanded functionality, with which help the protocol files are filtered and evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 & kssetup log; a number of useful features include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of the Syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other features are also included and are explained in the additional chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you can see in the following screen photograph, the system logue is provided, with their help to easily filters and sort the individual protocol lines of a protocol file. the individual possibilities for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this handbook.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After the start to start & boot log log; initially the most important protocol file of the system - the system protocol - to open you, and it takes place under Linux normally in the file / var / log, for normal users, usually no justification to reading.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filters after a limited range of characters. in the default configuration, the selection box contains only displayed, so that the selection box contains only displayed, if in one of the columns you have the string of the filter search term.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can also select a different entry in this section. for example, in the protocol file system, select the column process only with entries in the protocol's name, so shows you & kslog log; all protocol lines which were sent or produced from this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is activated in the default settings, and helps you recognize the important protocol lines. protocol lines of level mistakes are displayed with a conspicuous color than protocol lines of the level hint. the color display of protocol lines can be disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to display only certain process (e.g. in system protocol or in the cron Protocol), so you can examine the process identification (PID) in the column process. this can then be useful for example to start the Samba server. in this case you use filter bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">Furthermore, you can activate the option to new lines in the context menu of the master window to view all new web-coming protocol lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& kslog log; enables the display of several protocol files in separate subwindows. to open this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional windows. once you select a sub-window, select the menu on display in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& Support Systemlog; has its own website to http: / / ksystem log.forum-software.org. dort you will find further information about the supply range of & kslog.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& boot log log; find also in the following folder of the & KDE; -Subversion Archive: kssetup log; in & KDE; Archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & KDE; System V Init Editor, rather known (and in the following also named) as & ksysv; this section runs a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2957">The system V Init evolved to the standard for checking the program starts when updrive the system in the & Linux; world. therefore, because it is easier to use, more powerful and more flexible than the traditional BSD -Init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go on historical aspects (e.g. because I know nothing about it: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The init-binding file is therefore important under / sam and not under / etc. this is therefore important because someone could try to make a machine on System V Init without a reinstall and new format. therefore, you need to make sure that the old Init was removed from there where there was there one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init also distinguishes itself from the BSD Init that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc. this folder is called rc.d. Dort you will find rc.sysinit and the following further folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a whole lot scripts. basically, you need to start a script for any system service, which you want to run on another running level. system services include such things such as network, NFS, & sendmail;, httpd & etc. system services does not include such matters such as offset serial that is only once started. such calls belong to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should lie down below / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even if it does not have much use for it. you can also let down a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to run something like high, what to do with the serial port.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel is looking for different places after the program init and starts the first one finds it.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The standard Running is entered in / etc / inittab. you should see the following line as the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">On this point you can cast a look into the second column and probably determine that you can change the default Running 3. if you want to change anything, then you can manually repair any changes, then proceed to the system by restart the system and run the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start all the correct scripts? if you set it in rc3.d, then you will see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no right files in this folder. instead, each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the directory init.d.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How does it start and stop system services? very simple: each of the scripts are written so that it does not accept a argument like start and stop. you can actually start this script in the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would hold the httpd server. init reads the name, and if the K does not include the script if it includes a S, the script will be called the script by the argument.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people wish to set up a simple way to create machines for many purposes. I could run & eg; a server runlevel, which can run only httpd, & sendmail;, network & etc. furthermore, I could also have a user Running, the & eg; & kdm;, network & etc.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you can learn the use of & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointer, it is simple to say trivial: just drag a entry from the price of your disposal system services to one of the six running levels to start at this level (or stop it).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can shift scripts or modify the position between Runleveling or modify the position within one level by moving it. thereby, the entry of its original Running (or his position) is removed only if they pull out a entry from the price of our disposition services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: if you prefer to move them into a new area, you must select only from the menu, or from the context menu, and then insert it into the target zone -- even if the same entry exists in the target range of the promotion.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of a entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such case you need to edit the sorting numbers in the ambient entries, before you can try to insert the system services.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: there are no possibility to restore entries that have been thrown in the paper basket. be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the Tabulator button to activate the different working areas (availability Systems, Running 1 Start, Running 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to meet a selection of upper or below the previous ones.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move into another running level, move it with cut into the clipboard (you can also use ctrl; X) and add it to the desired Running with insert (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change sorting order number or the name of a entry manually, press the button to change the Properties dialog. connect the button to accept the dialog button in order to accept the changes, or press Esc to reject the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the menu file will require a confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. defaults to the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) are stored. otherwise, they are stored by & ksysv; changes to the defaults are stored in a local ksyrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I tried to experiment with the standard Runleveling, and now starts the machine constant. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">At lilo -Prompt linux single and press the input button to start in single-use mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default value level to a reasonable value (3 should normally be in order).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have some system services with & ksysv; for execution under Running X, but they are not performed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you use & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), you must process additional files in / etc, which are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of the distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The species, such as system services in these distributions, simplifies the configuration for the proprietary plugin programmes of this distributions, but unfortunately no standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you use a different distribution: check if all configuration files are available, which are required by the respective system service (and also whether they are in the right directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache resp / httpd) do not end without the message if your configuration files are not available or false.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The meaning of the & Linux; Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be of version differently. if you use a different distribution, please send me information on Running, so this manual can be added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation is based on & user; 1.0. with this program you can centrally manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & kuser; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of & user;</seg>
<seg id="2991">Once you have made changes, you have to save this. either use the corresponding symbol of the toolbar or entry to the menu in the File menu.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& user; is a simple application. the main window consists of two cartilcards, the user and the use session. to edit the desired user or the desired group with a double click on the entry. it appears the dialog or group properties.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some cardboard cards are only displayed if you have extended system settings. only if you have advanced system settings, if you are able to record individual settings, if shadow passwords or such as / etc / master.passwd are installed as well as BSD / master.passwd.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The ticket card password will appear if shadow passwords or such as / etc / master.passwd are installed as in BSD -Unix.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This ticket card appears only if you need to activate and initialize the file system (Quota) file system (recognizable at the file quoted a.user / quota group on the file system). here you can change parameters for each user parameters in KB:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be adjusted individually for each file system. the current file system is selected by means of the field file system.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The ticket card groups informs about the group of the selected user. the standard group, to which the user belongs, can be found in the primary group. furthermore, the user can highlight the user into other groups by marking these in the large field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The Group's Properties dialog contains a list of all users. to add a user to the group, mark this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or a group, choose from the menu user or group or click the matching drive button of the tool bar. editing or deleting the selected user or the selected group will be analogue.</seg>
<seg id="3000">Using this module, you can add the lilo boat manager, remove the boat password, remove and change the time to boats of the standard operating system, remove the standard operation system, remove, change operating systems, change, change and more.</seg>
