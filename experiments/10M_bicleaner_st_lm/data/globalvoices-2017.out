although I had visited the US since 2012 at least once a year , I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love to America is extremely large .
as many of my @-@ generation I grew up with American films , I have taught American music , American authors and operated his sport .
in fact , this country had a great pro@@ found effect on me that I was mainly based on an American film journalist .
when the 14 @-@ year @-@ old I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gray Gran@@ ist@@ le in The Pel@@ ican letter , a fear@@ less Rep@@ orter , who received his interest in the Supreme Court with judges who wanted to occup@@ y his interest .
I was caught .
&quot; &quot; &quot; free to Method Man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was if that is the absolute truth , forget everything else I want to make with my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona , I had only strengthened my ad@@ mir@@ ation for the USA .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; America is the only country where I ever lived , whose diversity is so welcoming , that you are always that you are , and there is easy acceptance in a community of equal human beings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I had even written a very nice love book about its greatness .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much has been written over the x@@ en@@ op@@ ho@@ bia and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his asc@@ ension is for me , as he is surrounded with its bott@@ len@@ ess .
he never stops behind the mountain , as you say so beautiful .
he predic@@ ts what he considers , as a former colleague it express , and publicly declared his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro@@ American and Women .
nevertheless , people who re@@ acts on his statements , and voted for him in hair for him .
the 13 million votes against the Republi@@ can elections in the Republi@@ can elections were the highest number formed by the party .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans that support these big@@ uous person , then I asked me ?
I was not able to get Tr@@ ump and his elec@@ tors in accordance with the people which I met in Phoenix during my time .
as for example my Professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism program , receives people from around the world , a deeply @-@ faith man , by whom I was able to talk about Islam and its past .
also , Tr@@ umps Pro@@ pose not voted by Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the present editor of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati Inqu@@ ir@@ er , &quot; survived .
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met for our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to watch the &quot; Phoenix &quot; at the game .
Tr@@ umps In@@ toler@@ ance is also in contrast to the gener@@ osity of movement that I experienced in Sandy B@@ ahr , who fought their lives for the environment , and her husband Dave , my guest family that treated me as their son .
even it fits them to the commitment of Krist@@ i K@@ app@@ es , who always helped me with patience and wor@@ m@@ wood and helped us to get to the complexity of the American life .
then Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors whose wise counsel have helped me much at my career .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these people and those who have shortened the values of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deep love to America &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while Tr@@ ump on his way to the nominated republi@@ can presidential data , they throw me a stop and the counter@@ part at his limited vision of America .
however , it turned out that they were the exception of rule .
on 8 November 2016 there were over 50 million Americans , mostly white , the presidency of a man , despite - or maybe due to his cont@@ emp@@ t against non @-@ white people .
the con@@ front@@ ation with the idea that people voted for Tr@@ ump , because they were either part@@ akers with his rac@@ ism and fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism , because they were ready to see these things , broke out almost the heart .
perhaps it is un@@ fair to describe Tr@@ ump @-@ voters as the assi@@ sts .
aff@@ ord@@ ed people , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation .
that is super@@ ficial and respec@@ t@@ less and indicates an in@@ ability to understand those who act in a different way and think .
it shows the people that their wor@@ ries and fear@@ ful changes will not be considered by the hec@@ tic changes in their congregations .
could it be that these voters have voted for Tr@@ ump , because they would like to re@@ win their control of a country that they have disappointed ?
in other words , they might perhaps say that they are still important in this America ?
perhaps too .
but you can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ n@@ ick , who comm@@ enting the cruel decision to raise a man that looks down with cont@@ emp@@ t on those who look different than he .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( AC ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : as much as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ jection of White against all other eth@@ nic@@ ities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The wording of white for white and wh@@ i@@ pl@@ ash &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; how great Van Jones declared , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been killed just what America did so great . &quot; &quot; &quot;
millions of people around the world estimate the American Ideal - no matter whether myth or reality , it is still a powerful idea - what faith or background you may always have , America is called every welcome .
because this country selected as his president , twice the son of a Ken@@ y@@ an@@ ers whose history as he himself says , no@@ where else in the world would be possible .
with the election of Donald Tr@@ umps , there is a huge part of white America &apos;s promise and say : to Hell with versat@@ ility , religious freedom and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in the America after 9 / 11 the white man is again at the Ru@@ der , they say .
at all , I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
at a rally for Hill@@ ary Clinton Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would have my son , captain Hum@@ ay@@ er K@@ ahn , a place in your United States ? &quot; he asked Mr. Khan .
the multitude answered with a loud &quot; No ! &quot;
&quot; didn &apos;t Muslims in your United States ? &quot;
no ! ! &quot; ro@@ ar the amount .
&quot; have Lat@@ inos a Place in your United States ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered them .
have A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American has a place in your United States ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they called them , and their voices were loud . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if someone who is not like you , is a place in your United States ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he received a vo@@ cal and loud &quot; NE@@ IN &quot; !
Mr. Khan ended with the words : &quot; God be thanks , Mr. Tr@@ ump , is that not your Americas . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected .
the country , for which his son had fallen , sent him a message .
this is now Tr@@ umps Land , told the message .
and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , could not find space in this new America anymore .
and I break my heart .

what has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero congregation in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca , with the children of the par@@ agu@@ a@@ ic city of Cat@@ e@@ ura together ?
that the music played in both places is not only the life of children , but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with the gar@@ bage
Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a great gar@@ bage dump , only 16 Kilometers south from O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial city , which is very popular among tourists , but worlds far from nearby gro@@ ov@@ arian ruins and its world famous kitchen .
for some years now the La B@@ anda de M@@ Ãº@@ sica ( Music band ) is now playing in the municipality : one of the existing symph@@ ony orchestra which , with their musical instruments , has a possibility to overcome them in the surrounding poverty .
a music school with 100 students is become a central interest for the municipality of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the commune , which is located in one of the p@@ oo@@ rest provinces of Mexico , is known for her drugs , abuse and gangs violence .
but this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot , who started a musical project and the youth offered as a rare hope .
young band members take their obligations towards the music group very serious , the local press not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI writes :
once they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch , they run through the dust roads to meet their great passion .
they always come and play with shiny eyes and play in the bust@@ le day for day trumpet , tromb@@ one , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , forest horn , ti@@ mp@@ ani , Bon@@ g@@ os and the Con@@ ga .
music from the gar@@ bage
more than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero &apos;s children play the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura - a village , which is practically on the largest land@@ fill of As@@ unci@@ on in the capital capital - on instruments which are made from recy@@ cle@@ ated waste material :
music with recovered instruments made from local firm waste materials , made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ e@@ ura where the Recycl@@ er under management of F@@ avi@@ o ChÃ¡vez started to trans@@ form parts of the waste in instruments .
the instruments im@@ itate violin , viola , c@@ elli , double bass , gu@@ itars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trumpets , tromb@@ ones and percussion , which were made out of rub@@ b@@ ish .
the repertoire includes classic music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen and Latin American music as well as music from the Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra , etc .
in an article in the Los Angeles Times F@@ avi@@ o ChÃ¡vez is remin@@ is@@ cent of the local environmental and musical teachers of the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura , at the beginning :
first it was very difficult because we had no room for rehear@@ s@@ als and we had to teach in the same place . the children knew not music and it was very difficult to contact their parents , because many of them do not live with their children .
that changed when F@@ avi@@ o was shown , what he had never seen before : a violin made from waste .
today , there is a complete orchestra which plays instruments of recovered material and is called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra .
a documentary named &quot; Land@@ mark Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic gar@@ bage dump ) draws the musical achievement :
the world generates about one billion tons of waste every year .
those who live with him and are living with him - like people in Cat@@ e@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they walk in something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspir@@ ing spectac@@ le of rub@@ b@@ ish @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra played his music even before Pope Francis :
these Eastern African countries show how technology and team@@ work can fight the illegal fishing .

this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine published by international , practi@@ ced solutions for environmental problems .
the re @-@ publication is conducted in the context of a agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for the common use of content .
in West Africa , it was known that this ship had already run illeg@@ itim@@ ate fishing waters in Liber@@ ian waters , before it visited Africa &apos;s other coast .
the Eastern African countries were brought to this way , and slightly obli@@ que to be called a lawyer of this kind to its coasts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Kom@@ ors , Mozambique and Seychelles mobil@@ ized quickly against the ship . they refused to withdraw one of their har@@ bours and refused to give him a fishing permit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the Prime Minister is surrounded by countries which you simply refused , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , an executive employee of the Ken@@ yan fishing authority , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is part of a team that discovered the ship in time and followed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 , the ship was driven out of the waters in the region : it was not succeeded to catch the fish .
finally , there was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars on Liberia , due to pill@@ aging the fish stocks .
the nu@@ cle@@ us of this initiative , the criminal practices and resources , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the NGO Stop illegal F@@ ishing ( Il@@ legal F@@ isheries Stop ) .
the members of this network in Somalia and Madagascar are the six countries that the Premier had driven out their waters at that time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries , which are equivalent and work together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts Project En@@ ding illeg@@ ally illegal . this project offers F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal f@@ isheries is un@@ regulated by definition : what is being caught , is hidden , corrup@@ ted because of it is extremely difficult . thus , the illegal fisher@@ y is a main cause of over@@ fishing of regions .
through the deliber@@ ate mis@@ use of existing laws , by which certain hab@@ itats and species are to be protected , the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems which have a delicate balance .
but during actions against illeg@@ ally cr@@ atic hur@@ dle with bureau@@ cr@@ atic hur@@ dle with the information between individual countries , these actions took place in real time , with tra@@ ce@@ able on F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communications platform .
there may be able to exchange individual countries , such as lists of exist@@ ent licenses , news related activities or details , which had been noticed or experienced during a harbour inspection .
fish @-@ i persecuted the activities of ships also very atten@@ tive if they move on the open sea by satellite data .
this allows to mark the authorities to mark ships which fish in banned territories . also , such a ra@@ ced ride will discover that a ship invites its caught fish onto another ships .
ideally , such investigations may show if the ships took a fish catch , where they were traveling and possibly even if they have a criminal .
countries that are against illegal fish catch can be refused on the basis of these information then the acceptance of such ships can be purchased in their ports . and that ships could not sell their load as the result of pen@@ alties , as in the case of the Premier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then there is considerable financial losses for the owner , what means that the illegal fish catch is fin@@ anci@@ ally worthwhile . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that &apos;s what we want to achieve , &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , Chief Director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consulting firm supporting the fight against illeg@@ ally f@@ isheries in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i too .
a closed front
the already mentioned platform was created to win over 20 million USD in lost sales , which lose eight members of the H@@ ISH network every year because of illegal fishermen , penet@@ rate in East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive t@@ una fish in East Africa , which attrac@@ ts the whole world of commercial fish from around the world . also these illegal fishermen use it .
these practices include actions like the sailing under false flag , counter@@ f@@ ake license papers , information of ph@@ ant@@ as@@ ien@@ cies , fishing protected species and fish areas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you ut@@ ili@@ ze the lack of international cooperation and do not make the weak@@ nesses of a non @-@ qu@@ ito control system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could tell a ship illeg@@ ally fishing and a country could say &apos; You must not let my port run . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but another country could say &apos; Com@@ m to me &apos; . &quot; and precisely this leg@@ ale hat@@ ch is trying to close F@@ ISH @-@ i now .
the closed front works so far .
since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH @-@ i was involved in more than 30 studies .
it has revealed criminal networks to spread the f@@ ake lic@@ ences in Tanzania . it discovered ships which used several fr@@ au@@ dul@@ ent ident@@ ities and found it @-@ vol@@ at@@ ly ships and found it .
due to its co @-@ operation with Inter@@ pol , the international authority for com@@ b@@ ating crimes , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share information on illegal fishing over long distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far to the networks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ber@@ gh says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he builds a system that F@@ ISH @-@ i is to help you who ut@@ ili@@ ze ships in precise ships .
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system that has always been developed further , helps to hide illegal ships in order to hide themselves .
&quot; the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position . &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , Chief analy@@ st deals with Tr@@ y@@ gg Mat Tra@@ cking , a NGO which deals with fishing data and F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support .
some of the ships run for example their automatic identification systems , where they can no longer be added by satellites .
zo@@ eland helps to build a system that combines various information systems . F@@ ISH @-@ i help to find criminal ships with greater precision .
a model program
but F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations can actually take effect on the und@@ ou@@ b@@ tedly global problem of illegal f@@ isheries ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes it .
recently , Sky@@ Truth opened the Platform Global F@@ ishing Watch platform together with Google and the Maritime Protection organisation Oce@@ ana , a platform that offers satellite data , and through which the position of each individual tra@@ ce@@ able ship can be displayed worldwide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to get a better picture of it , those who do what makes it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to help themselves and to bund@@ le their resources for the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this at a global level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project to run with which a global system allows persecution of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities do not only feel crime , but they are also loc@@ ust@@ s .
ships containing previously un@@ licensed and hardly with consequences , we know that they are observed .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in F@@ ISH @-@ i involved a 33 % rise in fishing investments , since then fishing boats could buy more licenses .
after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia helped Gre@@ ko 1 p@@ act together , the inspec@@ tors found there on board locks on board whose use is prohibited .
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also other countries notice this successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so important that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have become a study project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in West Africa , several hundred millions dollars annually through illegal f@@ isheries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there will be six countries together , to the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . even they fight the illegal f@@ isheries , according to exactly the same model like F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; With Security , the aim is to emer@@ ge even more such initiatives and structures even in other regions , &quot; says Cop@@ eland .
recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s youngest member states asked his first major triumph in October : in October , Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was travelling under false flag , and was not only used to use towing networks , which are now prohibited .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ship was still located in prohibited waters that were reserved for fishermen made up of Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the take @-@ out of measure against Gre@@ ko 1 , emphas@@ ises a strong sign that they go against illegal fish catch , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ber@@ gh &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for F@@ ISH @-@ i , this is a further success of many . and at the same time the evidence that such special , collabor@@ ative work is actually works in the entire world . Emma Br@@ yce is a freelance journalist and lives in London . she writes on the subject of environment , technology and diet .

particularly large waves beat the news about police repression in the central @-@ north shore of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
there , demonstr@@ ators moved back into the local cathedral , in order to protect themselves according to their own statement before the police and armed insur@@ ances of the government .
hours later , they could surely leave the cathedral again , but the protests were further forward .
in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop police forces , including those woman in the An@@ den@@ staat ( T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira ) :

the interview was translated into English and is published here with friendly permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qu@@ i@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to view the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argentine city CÃ³rdoba .
as now grown , Qu@@ i@@ j@@ ano said as part of the great La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera trial in the province of Cordoba against his father .
in the trial which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes were studied , which have committed during the Argentin@@ ean military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qu@@ i@@ j@@ ano have not sought out his life .
starting at the office , same name as his father bear to the brutal group of military operations in the La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough .
he kept the family secret for 34 years .
in the situation it was , I thought that was fine .
I felt like a secret .
as a child with 15 years you do not notice that one is manip@@ ulated by his father .
I could not know that my father was a thief , the following , and mur@@ der@@ ers .
Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qu@@ i@@ j@@ ano was G@@ end@@ ar@@ cler@@ k . during the Argentin@@ ean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father from 1976 to 1978 , had been deputy chief of the secret service of 141 under the prison La Per@@ la .

archive recording .
this is not the history of Luis Qu@@ i@@ j@@ ano , the oppressed , who was charged in 158 cases , torture , murder in nearly 100 cases and ab@@ duction of a 10 @-@ year child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qu@@ i@@ j@@ anos son , a man who had experienced a boy in the course of the years , which he had experienced as boy , and who testified before a Federal Court against his own father .
his story shows what great power is a parent , and how this child chose a way of salvation .
from the Sports Hall to the Military Center
when my father began to take me to the military base , I often went into the sports hall . there I had also stopped with a boy who made war sport .
all they called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ and @-@ white photo and called me to identify my friend .
he said :
you are a dick@@ head , you are getting friends with one of the ERP .
pass only that they don &apos;t carry you a day , and I will save you .
the ab@@ brevi@@ ation ERP stands for E@@ j@@ Ã©r@@ c@@ ito Revolutionary for Pueb@@ lo , - Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the Revolutionary Workers Party of Argentina .
that is why he charged me to go into the sports hall again . some days later he took me to work on the military base .
he said to me , I would be secret .
I was 15 years old and I thought I thought that would be fine . for so my father had moved to me .
on the military base , I had to destroy papers that had heard of the det@@ ain@@ ees .

&apos;@@ da@@ h , the prisoners are ex@@ tor@@ tured &apos;
my father took me four times after La Per@@ la with - everything in 1976 .
at the first and last time he left me at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time , he ordered me to get off . he led me to a bar@@ racks , in the cars , furniture , television , refriger@@ ators - simply all possible - stood .
everything was stolen .
he gave me a small wrap inside a blan@@ ket and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a large cl@@ ashes of silver .
this day I went to the other end of Bar@@ ac@@ ke , where the stolen objects have been removed and under@@ min@@ ed me with a wa@@ ist .
suddenly he interpreted an open space and said :
the det@@ ain@@ ees are tor@@ tured .
I saw , and saw a song , tor@@ tured on men .
she looked like a field bed and metal springs .
later I found out that it fortified the end of a cable . the other end was fixed on the body of the person who had just eaten there .
they viol@@ ate a man with hand @-@ sh@@ ank on the bed , cast it with water and drove him a charge of 220 volts to the gen@@ itals .

the gre@@ y@@ ank there was unbe@@ ar@@ able ... like a dirty win@@ del .
years later when my father stood under house arrest , the same smell of his room came .
I realized the smell immediately and it became clear that the smell of an body is in need .
I never could never forget this smell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I asked me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How is it possible for a man to do another so much harm ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ I knew that these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were bound with hand @-@ cells and were ey@@ ed .
he spoke to &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; L@@ op@@ ez ( Jose L@@ Ã³@@ pe@@ z , a civilians who also was in the trial ) and I used the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background I saw a set of matt@@ resses , on which naked people were folded with face down - all were folded at hands and feet .
close to the entrance , humans remain quiet on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father noted that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you look so , ar@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; why have you met ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why have you brought me otherwise ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and was buried by soldiers .
I know this , because my father told you at home .
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms that were known as offices .
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero collap@@ sed and killed there .
( according to the survivors of the civil war Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also accused of trial in La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera , was accused of sentenced to death Ra@@ Ãº@@ l Mat@@ eo Molina ) .
in the following video , Emil@@ io F@@ essi@@ a , the head of the memorial La Per@@ la , led by the former fol@@ ky chambers .
the path where you came in here , is also the way where the escape came here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you see on the map , you &apos;ll see that they were about this road and then tor@@ tured for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
here , their names were changed and they were assigned a number given as part of the trial .
when they had survived torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order of the above mentioned that they should be re@@ located .
this was the lie - eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of people and disappearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; War yield &apos;
my father brought all possible stolen things with home .
at that time , in the old age I had no idea that the &quot; mar@@ tial arts &quot; - as they called it - was .
but when I was later on the military , I was in the g@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie - I was clear that the spo@@ ils won a bay@@ on@@ et or maybe military police , which one has fought an enemy that has fought one enemy .

but when you go into a house and the fridge , the record player , clothes , paintings , money ... ste@@ als , then does not contain any war spo@@ ils but V@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
I always asked me how my father , the leader of the security forces , could join this V@@ and@@ alism .
I don &apos;t understand it .
I was an officer in the g@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie and I had never fallen as@@ ps into an house and steal all things to steal .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do this .
once he called me a crime , and I answered : and thou , which thou shou@@ ld@@ est drive cars on the street ?
you are no crime ?
he explo@@ des against anger , struck me , and cried , saying ,
if you walk so far , then I will find you and keep your own hands .
that we need any other !
that was my father .
I have no only good memories of him .
when I heard in the process , I showed a photo from then , on which I got a jacket and a roll of wool . both my father made from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he still brought clothing with home .
at that time , the defence accused me to have compassion on this crime . I said , no problem , they can lay me a burden which they wanted .
I was anyway to speak .
&apos;@@ The disappearance of cor@@ ks is the last ab@@ h@@ or act .
now , where I am older , I feel sick .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have children . if you have only children , you recognize the value of a life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one develops further and recognizes that it is wrong to kill .
I was even so far to say :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well , you have executed people during the dictatorship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why do children use ?
one day , my father brought a girl with home , whose mother was killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl .
I turned back the question : they were tor@@ tured : but why were they killed ?
however , they could simply have put into prison .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think it was simply chosen to kill those people , but what did they disappear their bodies ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
did these people not have families to give their mort@@ al rem@@ n@@ ants ?
the dis@@ appearances is the last ab@@ h@@ or act that one can do a man .
my father told me when the democracy was re@@ introduced to eliminate the mort@@ al remains of the det@@ ain@@ ees .
they were crushed and no@@ d@@ led somewhere - no idea where . &quot; one will never find something , &quot; said my father .
but anything remains of course .
&apos;@@ I &apos;ve seen how you killed people ! &apos;
only to declare it : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just found the truth about 20 crime - including my father .
the idea to view my father was taken during a talk when he was under house arrest .
I did his accus@@ ations due to all of the cru@@ el@@ ih@@ ood that I had to take away on him because of his sake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he said suddenly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I have never killed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I felt inside and asked me , what the whole bu@@ oy@@ ancy Patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which they allegedly were supposed to have been good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then I cried :
how can you say about me ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed aw@@ ful crime and you are forced to join me as a child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then don &apos;t forgive me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
exactly what did I do .
I re@@ compens@@ ed the first ad in 2010 .
I finally had known that he was a crimin@@ als .
nobody can pret@@ end to me that I &apos;m not ingen@@ ious . I finally told my own father .

translation errors makes older people in Kyoto on &quot; terrible drivers &quot;
the sign with the translation errors in a center in Kyoto , where one can pro@@ long his license .
the photo was spread in social media .
editing of original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the Japanese City of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can pro@@ long the leaders of a completely failed translation in the last month . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; on a sign the Japanese word ( co@@ rei@@ den@@ ten@@ sh@@ a ) , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; means &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; maybe as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; can also be translated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear@@ ful drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was on electronic ads from the 1 to 20 September in the input range and in the building itself .
editing the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine , which was multiple divided into the social media .
the error was the translator Julian Holmes , a inhabitants of Ky@@ ot@@ os , fell as@@ much . he was also who atten@@ tively attention to the local time .
the Kyoto @-@ based daily Kyoto Shim@@ bu@@ n wrote :
&quot; how could it happen to such an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is an ins@@ ult to elderly people and an international city , such as Kyoto , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holmes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Holmes &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the error translation was first removed first . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( german : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) was later replaced by the appropriate number if also the gramm@@ ar not correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ der drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) was replaced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police pre@@ fecture in Kyoto speaks for translation errors . still explained that the error was already contained in the text which they received from trans@@ lat@@ ors and that the translation has not been checked for their correc@@ t@@ ness before it was published .
a blo@@ g@@ ger reported as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &apos;re sorry that older people are afflicted by the in@@ adequate correction ( the translation ) on the other hand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Japanese online news service J @-@ cast News continued a little further with the phenomenon of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear@@ ful &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was im@@ ited as an adequate description for older drivers . according to the police , the proportion of elderly people involved in accidents are involved , but are quite anxi@@ ous to worry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Kyoto Pre@@ fecture , for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of a total of 19.@@ 460 accidents were caused by senior citizens . this represents an increase of 10 % .
ten years later , in 2014 , seniors made a total of 1,@@ 8@@ 850 accidents .
this increased its share to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents fell in total , the proportion of unemployed caused accidents in the same period has risen in the same period .
the default repor@@ ter not mentioned repor@@ ter resulted in the release of Article comments on light , which show what pre@@ judi@@ ces some Japanese are seem@@ ingly against older drivers :
the article on Yahoo about the translation errors got the following comments :
- &quot; Is this ( &quot; terrible driving &quot; ) about reality ? &quot;
- &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the translation is not bad , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
- &quot; I don &apos;t think that that is a real translation error . &quot;
there are not many such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish is widespread in all Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com website is a real mine of these bizar@@ re errors in English .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ User Andrew .
the reasons for the wide spread of translation defects are multi@@ fac@@ eted .
to translate , you need two important abilities : passive language skills to understand the output text and active language skills to transmit him into the target language .
the latter requires the active rule of the target language - something that is in the native language . generally , the convic@@ tion shall be in the target language - not in the language language - not in the native language - native language .
thus a French mother language should translate from English by French into French - not from French into English .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ User Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ workers with English as the mother tongue , the translation of English could be attributed to English , cost @-@ reasons or the relatively small number of English speakers that learn Japanese .
some companies that have no foreign employees have to make translation work together . then the Japanese staff , whose Engl@@ ish@@ list is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really good .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ User Karl Baron .
machine translations are widespread in widespread use - often with funny results .
the wor@@ r@@ ens and h@@ ig@@ matic phr@@ ases that arise by mechanical translation , show that this technology can substitute for a long @-@ term trans@@ lat@@ ors . this applies to some languages all very special .
some of the strange English for@@ mu@@ k@@ ings in Japan , among them the don@@ key prints , often used t @-@ shirts or hand@@ leb@@ ars , are only used for stylish reasons - not to be read or understood .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ User Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors like jewelry still acceptable or at least harm@@ less . but of big companies or from the government who have the means to guarantee higher standards , you can expect more detailed translations .

Venezuela : protests and action plans to take on the Internet and television
the main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ it@@ con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( Free Sur@@ fing ) of the IP@@ YS ( Institu@@ to PR@@ EN@@ SA y Soci@@ ed@@ ad , Institute of Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , the 7th of April , Venezu@@ elan Internet users , that they had no access to online broad@@ caster Viv@@ op@@ lay .
later , other users wrote that the Internet presence of V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV must be no longer accessible .
other online stations also contributed to the protests of the protests in Caracas using op@@ positi@@ onal groups that re@@ vo@@ ke the Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ u@@ ros government .
the protests began in early April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the tasks of Parliament to the executive and the Supreme Court itself .
Luis Carlos D@@ Ã­@@ az , journalist and author of Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a Tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection is to use , and receive VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet .
# Z@@ ens@@ or@@ ship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that Internet sites of Venezu@@ elan Provider are re@@ closed again .
that is from the site of @ Viv@@ o@@ Play@@ Net .
offers like Viv@@ op@@ lay , with Internet access , especially in periods of un@@ rest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since 2014 , traditional media are threatened with protests in protests . at that time , the Commission threatened to report with money band@@ ings and closure , when the Commission continues to report on the demonstrations , as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Call to violence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
without a cable TV and informative national TV channels I registered for @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
amazing that it &apos;s still cheaper than two liters of lem@@ on@@ ade .
the local NGO Association fil@@ tro confirmed that not only Viv@@ op@@ lay by a blocking of the domain name system ( DNS ) is not accessible , but also two other online broad@@ casts . this also concerns the website where the National Assembly transfers its sessions .
earlier post@@ ings of the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that the local Internet providers can use DNA . thereby , it is a technology that answer the DNS server query of certain domains .
if a website is blo@@ cked by DNS , the server answers a faul@@ ty or refuse the request when calling on such a website .
we confirm a DNS lock : @ el@@ o@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
at V@@ P@@ IT@@ V , a third per@@ verse channel , the transmission was stopped on Thursday , April 6 , when the V@@ P@@ IT@@ V camera was Elvis Flo@@ res , who was carried out to Caracas live in prison .
Flo@@ res was struck , while he was found in custody .
eight hours later he was released , and V@@ P@@ IT@@ V passed on show again .
although some channels are still accessible from YouTube , it was reported that the government regul@@ ates the internet connections : this means the dental vene@@ ers of access to multi media coverage about the current events in the country .
in Paraguay , many girls will get for slaves to get a training
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a child of Cri@@ ad@@ ita . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
today Tina in the rights of children and collec@@ ts witness of other Cri@@ ad@@ itas , who were exactly like they were victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the licensed version of a report of tur@@ ally , published by Global Vo@@ ices with the courtesy of the authors .
the article is part of a series with the title &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ elan , es@@ cu@@ elas , Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; F@@ lying cows , falling schools &quot; ) that will be edited by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America and will be re @-@ released .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household , in which they do not living together with the family that lived there .
shortly before her studies at the university , she returned once again into the house and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride on her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old , she began working as Cri@@ ad@@ ita for the family . as Cri@@ ad@@ itas , man named in Paraguay the more than 46@@ ,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the shop is very simple : a large family with little money over@@ took their minor son or their minor daughter to another , more abundant family . in the exchange the child receives food , an apprentices@@ hip as well as a roof over the head .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , what is not mentioned that the children must never have countless days of household labour , who can never be paid and abuse of abuse and abuse - and all that can &apos;t lift up in the context of a contract . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go , practice is widely distributed in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance by large parts of the society and despite numerous complaints by human rights organizations .
after completing her studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for an organization called for the rights of boys and girls .
in the case , she said with Cri@@ ad@@ itas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected testimonies , resear@@ ched and delayed .
in general , they attempted to name things by name , because the feeling of grat@@ itude , which is inj@@ ected by the Cri@@ ad@@ itas , are guaranteed in general .
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; says Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is also the family that will improve their daughter in faith , that they will improve their position in society , and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can make something of himself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to another family . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the family , which takes the girl in itself , whose exploitation is just@@ i@@ fies with faith , that it would not give someone a chance that would have won &apos;t get a chance and maybe even was hungry .
the Sac@@ ri@@ fice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
when the girl is har@@ assed , his family will be experienced only many years later .
sometimes they even experienced .
so far , in January 2016 , the relatively unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the secret of par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , but had a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n arrived in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ Ãº in hospital , showed her body traces of severe stro@@ kes . shortly after , she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ ad@@ ita in the household of the former military officer Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ re@@ ira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as an officer at the residence .
Mar@@ Ã­n lived with them in the house of V@@ aqu@@ er@@ Ã­a , a small town located at only 3,000 inhabitants , 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ on .
at the end of January 2016 Fer@@ re@@ ira struck Fer@@ re@@ ira until it suffered a deadly injury .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
some days later the media reported about the incident .
they emphas@@ ise that the murdered child was a Cri@@ ad@@ ita .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; organizations such as UNICEF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the deep in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen Society &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the death of the girl . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she recorded the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came to protest at protests and called that there will be no further Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widespread in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay more cows are registered as children , &quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was charged .
without papers , it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children .
without official documents it is very difficult to control , under which conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbours of the married couples and nearly 60 civil organizations demanded an excellent investigation .
they want to be sentenced by Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ re@@ ira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl who had been sentenced to 30 years in prison .
if the case comes before judgment , the case of Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n could be landmark , for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go before judgment comes .
everyday life of a Cri@@ ad@@ ita
the Cri@@ ad@@ itas will not only explo@@ ited as labour force , they also live isolated from other girls in their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bi@@ k , in which her father worked as a bank@@ rupt@@ cy , and their father lost his work .
your brothers had to go all work and started to sell money on the road or on the market swe@@ ets to earn money .
they were all continued to school .
only Tina was sent as Cri@@ ad@@ ita in the capital As@@ unci@@ on .
in the house of her employer Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was working between four and six hours every day .
it was necessary to divide the time that her still remained for learning again .
it stood every morning at 5 o &apos;clock and prepared the breakfast for their employer .
Fri@@ days , for example , cleanse the refrigerator , the living room , polished the furniture and the infected ground .
when the school was at the end , she went home again and had time for learning .
the more they were ready with learning , the more leisure had it .
but this time was limited , because they had to make dinner for their employer .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says it was never hungry , but didn &apos;t get any food . &quot; I could get more books from the library of the budget than food from the fridge , &quot; she reminds me .
the library was well @-@ equipped and belonged to the households , a former military and sympath@@ izers of Parti@@ do liberal , a liberal party , who belonged to the government of Alfredo Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who belonged to the opposition from 1954 until 1989 .
in some evenings of the house@@ keeper Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , in addition to him and guiding article from the opposition tim@@ ings such as &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pueb@@ lo &quot; are to be read .
yet he tried to convince them to give the reports of the official media about the regime of the dict@@ ator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he was indeed for intelligent , but didn &apos;t talk to her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the stew@@ ards had found someone who heard about politics while he spoke about politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t allowed me to visit my family because they were again &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bad hab@@ its &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they supposed that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a belongs to the indigenous group of the Guaran@@ i , at home again their native language Guaran@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they feared their Lord , that they had the education that they had allowed to lose it again , explains her .
however , it was completely clear that she had paid for everything they had paid for them with their hard work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also in school , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discrimin@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing that is almost never spoken , mo@@ b@@ bing and the ch@@ ic@@ ans are exposed to those Cri@@ ad@@ itas &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because the other children have their parents , they immediately acknowledge that someone who has no parents is cri@@ ad@@ ita .
I could not invite you to home . I had no friends circle in school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , at the time where friends are created , I felt very much that I was one group .

in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a fac@@ ebook group where there is a job vac@@ ant for cleaning staff and child care in Paraguay .

hello ! I &apos;m looking for a small companion for my little daughter , who plays in the morning and in the afternoon with her .

please call you .
beginning from Monday , if possible .
the ad received five &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; and many comments .
a woman from the site Ã@@ em@@ by wrote that she would have a celebrated girl and gave her telephone number .
another woman who also came from Ã@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 @-@ year old ni@@ ece . &quot; you like little children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote .
in the third chapter , by &quot; a girl from the interior of the interior I want to work . &quot;
then the author filed an ad in the ad once again :
Dear friends , I found one . I look , if it works with her .
thank you , I am writing again when something is something .
the shop was complete .

draft announ@@ cing the Egyptian users of social media to register in the government
picture by Pix@@ ab@@ ay , changes by Global Vo@@ ices .
published by the Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
sixty Egyptian parliamentary members recently agreed a bill to &quot; the Regulation on the use of use and social networks . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he is accepted by Parliament , users must register for social media in Egypt with a government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
based on the law , then a site would then be established in order to take advantage of the social media , citizens and citizens to share social media .
within six months with the adoption of the law , users would have to register with their right names and identity numbers to use social networks .
if it is missed to do this , this could bring a penalty of up to six months &apos; imprisonment or a fine .
the bill , which consists of six paragra@@ phs , and in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media than &quot; jed@@ we@@ de use that will run on the Internet and is used to communicate with others through voice , video and text . &quot;
it is un@@ clear how the law is set through it , since the draft is no indication , as the Egyptian government shall not register upon the fact that the Egyptian government is currently not able to ensure that the Egyptian government is currently not able to guarantee the regulation on the level of social media enterprise .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , parliamentary committee and promot@@ er of the Law , told the magazine Al Monitor , registered users , and a password &quot; to enter a password by the Firewall gate , the Facebook blo@@ cked . &quot;
this could mean that Egypt is planning a fire@@ wall on national level around Facebook . due to them it would be necessary to submit information to the Egyptian and Egyptians to access the network to the network .
but it is not known that such plans do exist .
experts and experts are sc@@ ep@@ tical regarding the technical fe@@ asi@@ bility of action .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ological ( at German &quot; senior research scientist &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices :
I strongly recommend to technical capacities and understanding any authority in Egypt either concerning things that have to do with technology .
in my opinion , they imagine , that just as they were able to control physical public and private rooms , it could also be done online .
if I think it , then means that they will apply a strong surveillance system to con@@ struct citizens , or not . and this means a crazy system to monitor the activities of humans and also to comp@@ ose it to a trial .
this is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be adopted as a law , the draft must be discussed at the elections of the Parliament and the constitutional complaints before it comes into the plenary debate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether his acceptance and en@@ forcement has been successful or not , the draft &quot; is in line with a pro @-@ military mind in parliament , in whose sense it is necessary and ensured that no different repos@@ it@@ ations are present on the image area , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of .
last year , Tam@@ er El @-@ Sh@@ ah@@ aw@@ y proposed legislation against cy@@ ber crimin@@ ality in which a life @-@ term sentence for those intended to thre@@ aten &quot; public order to thre@@ aten &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; to protest . &quot;

high above , in the mountains of the region of Kurdistan in the nor@@ the@@ astern Iraq , the animal hus@@ band@@ man H@@ ana Ahmed R@@ aza and its team of scientists work by the non @-@ governmental organization Nature Iraq to protect the mentally challenged Persian Leop@@ ards .
a sub@@ species of the greater family of le@@ op@@ ards , which origin@@ ates from Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian Leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . they are between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are due to us , loss and frag@@ mentation of their hab@@ itat , and there are always fewer prey .
why is this particular kind of le@@ op@@ ards so important ?
like R@@ aza in the video shows , &quot; the Persian is the only remaining pre@@ dat@@ e@@ tier in the Kur@@ dish ecos@@ ystem &quot; and the health and th@@ ri@@ ves of the ecos@@ ystem also depends on that a big cat@@ fish is present .
the chance to see a Persian Leop@@ ards are really visible in the wild bo@@ bs@@ lei@@ gh and is about zero . when the team in the video shows that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera , R@@ aza broke out in a pure joy .
when educated Bi@@ ologist shows R@@ aza passionate about another side of her country , which consists not only from war and conflict .
since six years she has been involved in field studies on wild living animals and educational programs of Nature Iraq .
it has also been a member of IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Specialist Group since 2013 and sets up that protection zones for wildlife will be established in the Kurdistan region .

in early March 2017 , the daily K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o , the progress made in nor@@ the@@ astern Japan were committed to re@@ build the life of those who had been affected by the &quot; triple catastrophe , &quot; a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hima had caused the catastrophe .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Zeitung , located in An@@ ai , located in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ fecture . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ fecture was a tremend@@ ous pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures in Japan &apos;s northeast , which both had to experience the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neigh@@ bor of Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate were forced evacu@@ ated , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had van@@ ished whole cows from the map .
even in this end , the Fu@@ kus@@ hima Pre@@ fecture had experienced a nuclear accident , even so alone , 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes .
the special report of the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o shows from local perspective , which have been achieved six years later to re@@ build the life of local residents .
the detailed report of the newspaper includes both statistics of Japanese re@@ building authority as well as survey results of the affected themselves .
the residence in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o Zeitung reports that a total of 77 percent of the planned replacement stores ( law @-@ president , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) has been completed in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate .
mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i &apos;s largest success could be found among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , 80 percent of the planned spare parts were completed .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 per cent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hima will remain the final light with 70 percent .
nevertheless , six years after the catastrophe , we are trying to re@@ locate the evacu@@ ation of accommodation ( the world , cas@@ et@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) in final replacement houses .
after the Thir@@ ty catastrophe , almost 80 000 people were forced to live in home @-@ education .
still 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate lived in such services still in December 2016 .
almost 40 percent of the evacu@@ ated victims of Fu@@ kus@@ hima are still living in emer@@ gen@@ cies , whereas at Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was successful . over 75 per cent of the evacu@@ ated evacu@@ ation that were settled after the disaster in accommodation , were settled in final homes .
for I@@ w@@ ate the figure is 34 percent .
the state of work and daily routine in the three concerned pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
like the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Zeitung , have received 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools that were affected by the harm to the end of December 2016 , which makes nearly 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later , the industrial reconstruction was far more difficult in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
while nearly 100 per cent of fish ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now back into operation , only 30 percent of fishing ports have re@@ recorded their operation in Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and nuclear accident , having pulled in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agriculture in the country .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i could recover 93 percent of its agricultural areas , only 66 percent of the farm@@ land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed in Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
it is un@@ likely that only one episode of the atomic fact is , because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares destroyed the farm@@ land of Fu@@ kus@@ hima , in the nuclear wave area . &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has gone up again , but he left Fu@@ kus@@ hima far back here .
the tourist figures in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are back up to 90 percent at the same time as before the harm . Fu@@ kus@@ hima however can have only 75 percent .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o Zeitung reports that since the disaster has almost half of the coastal towns , it was more difficult to earn their lives .
is the native population being prepared for the next big earthquake ?
in order to determine a complete picture , the newspaper introduced numerous surveys conducted among the local population and evacu@@ ated by the evacu@@ ation of the re@@ building and also how their receiving exchange has changed from the ts@@ un@@ ami risk .
in her introduction of the article the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Zeitung explains :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o led a survey to bring more about the ts@@ un@@ ami consciousness among the native population of experience .
the survey carried out that 8@@ 3.1 percent of resident population will have taken hold in order to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.9 percent of respon@@ dents say that still not enough to be done for cat@@ ast@@ roph@@ es prevention .
what about those who had to be evacu@@ ated from the Fu@@ kus@@ hima Pre@@ fecture
in their edition to the anniversary of the earthquake , K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper has strengthened its attention to the situation of evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
Fu@@ kus@@ hima had not only had to experience the devastating earthquake and devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima was also a witness of the worst , cat@@ ast@@ roph@@ ic un@@ distur@@ ban@@ ces , nuclear accident in Japan .
of 160 000 evacu@@ ated victims from Fu@@ kus@@ hima were nearly 63 000 people in areas outside the pre@@ fecture .
at the beginning of 2016 , some more than 23 000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hima , had been settled in permanent replacement houses .
as of 2017 , there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hima still living outside their home pre@@ fecture .
in the cat@@ ast@@ roph@@ ones , most of the evacu@@ ations have been missed , are older than 50 years old . they are not able to compete in correct accommodation because the efforts are competing for the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hima . this is the construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games to be held in Tokyo in 2020 .
the world is small : our Pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
if people meet from other countries that speak a different language , the differences were initially greater than the simil@@ ar@@ ities .
however , after a while , you often recognize that a more combines than it appears on the first sight .
these global links are important , since they require our pre@@ judi@@ ces , improve our perspectives and remember that the world finally is very small .
in this sequence of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we &apos;ll show us exactly these global links . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we will deal with topics that get fewer attention when they earn .
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember to remember a moment in which they have felt very strong with someone about language and country borders .
Veron@@ iki Kri@@ kon@@ i talks about the simil@@ ar@@ ities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i Camar@@ asa talks about the time where she worked with people from around the world in London ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences which he collected in a small village in Madagascar .

Brazilian activity in artificial comp@@ a , after having joined the police in nationwide demonstrations
left : the attack against Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva . photo : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z . release with permission .
right : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva on a widely used photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit : last Friday , a police officer had defeated him during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , with a stroke against the head . in nationwide , millions of demonstr@@ ators participated in a protest march towards Spar@@ ks .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , studied social sciences at the University of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s , has suffered a skull of brain trau@@ ma and several fra@@ c@@ tures .
doctors oper@@ ated him on this Saturday and now brought him into an artificial comp@@ a .
its condition is considered critical .
the local photo journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus sitting in Brazil for a few days quickly .
on the pictures , the vision of the police officers can be seen , who identified with a stroke . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s announced that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o was suspended until the conclusion of the investigation of the active service suspended .
the pictures show the police officers , as he held in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , with his impact on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
if a police officers were beaten by a demonstr@@ ators and l@@ ending on an intensive care station , his face would be seen for six months on television and all repression would be justified .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ ol@@ al@@ iz@@ ador , &quot; a press channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , divided by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z , which one sees when Mat@@ eus will be attacked by police officers and several sanitary ware shortly after him .
another video with the same scenes , but from another perspective , is also emerged in social networks .
clip shown below shows the attack on Mat@@ eus down the 50th second .
for Mat@@ eus the family lives in another state , Internet users have donated 10,000 Brazilian re@@ ais ( approximately 2,@@ 700 Euro ) to meet a portion of costs for medical care and to stay in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , while he is in the hospital .

on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado is calling for more violent attacks against activists in Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s .
Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s experiences a wave of political force : here the activ@@ ist Gu@@ il@@ her@@ me Irish was murdered by his father , because he was a occupied school with a gas le@@ ak@@ y . here , after having been attacked by a polic@@ emen who had been attacked by a polic@@ emen who had hit him with a stroke .
police disp@@ rop@@ es
Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s was not the only state in Brazil where it came on the last Friday , brutal police operations against demonstr@@ ators .
polic@@ emen sat on protests in the center of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had built a stage for Red@@ ner , rubber ra@@ f@@ in and dr@@ unk@@ en@@ as .
MPs Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Peace Party ( PS@@ OL ) , asked the police via loudspeaker announ@@ cements to violence against demonstr@@ ators .
this also includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the whole country .
once again the Brazilian media street protests , by putting the focus on another , unexpected prot@@ agon@@ ists : a window disc .
the following ha de S. Paulo and est@@ ado de S. Paulo reported specifically for a broken glass window to illustr@@ ate with a picture of the cover sides .
on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o preferred a title story with a fire on fire .
there is no pl@@ au@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason , more about a broken window disc than the protests of thousands of people who serve as a special cause to report .
this must also be seen , if you stri@@ pped against any form of atomic damage .
here , the term &quot; V@@ and@@ alism &quot; is an ab@@ sur@@ d , disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ate importance , and the typical violence of the military police are disp@@ at@@ ched by demonstr@@ ators with the title &quot; demonstr@@ ators on con@@ front@@ ation course with the police . &quot;
the villages of un@@ du@@ str@@ alization forgotten villages in Cuba
with the introduction of the law of Ã@@ l@@ var@@ o Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugar pipes included in all the doors of Cuba ( Photo : Juli@@ o B@@ atist@@ a )
the village of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ i located in the western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is widely known as el Central - on Spanish sugar mill - known , regardless that there is no significant sugar on site .
it is two years ago when the activities were produced in the sugar cane mills .
after the necessity of the sugar cane industry in the region , and the factory lost after and after its plants , until only the rum@@ or made of steel and concrete remained .
about 272 workers had to inv@@ ent themselves .
some changes the work .
others signed and comm@@ its every day to the factories which still grin@@ d .
N@@ ene , a veter@@ an affairs which stands up every day at 4 : 00 in the morning , the crisis in the sugar tube industry does not har@@ den his sleep .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he heard that there are factories in the east of the su@@ gar@@ cane mills , which are due after long in@@ active days , because they were received . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was something that he was not expected .
N@@ ene reminds us exactly , that in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ I won the sugar cane sugar , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar tub@@ ing industry is already using the pl@@ agues , the case of socialism , low market prices , the poor efficiency , and climate change .
in 2016 , the production was 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than 1910 produced .
the message would have been some decades ago as a motive for the rest of the country , but the bad ones have already been a lot more .
why was the Cuban sugar industry switched off ?
the old railway platform of the congregation already looked better times .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ atist@@ a )
the reduction of the sugar tube industry was an economical necessity : the 155 sugar cane mills were technically demanding , and hardly competitive were they in@@ sufficient for the country .
the initial idea was to concentrate on the most efficient factories , the annual production target was 4 million tonnes .
only the factories are left to produce sugar for maximum 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the moti@@ ves that lead to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the rise rise in the world market .
nevertheless , the sugar price increased from about one decade ago .
from 2017 to 2025 , the price of un@@ refined sugar will remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the report published by the OECD , the OECD , Food and Food Organization of the United Nations .
if the current production would achieve the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar would generate about $ 85 million for the country .
not everything worked well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day with security in history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who were the first words of Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the Lav@@ ander@@ o sugar factory . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began .
in the following years the n@@ urs@@ ing of 98 sugar cane factories came to more than 65 million persons received their full sal@@ aries for continuing education .
the same thing happened in the sugar tube factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ Ã©e Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ i on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto PÃ©@@ rez worked in the factory since 1967 .
if N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , talking about the closure of the factory , the Word , which he repeatedly , &quot; sc@@ am . &quot;
nearly all respon@@ dents are of the same opinion , not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
in order to get the place , they formed a full @-@ time working group .
before the first break year , the first letters began to come .
it was an official documents that were registered only concerning the parts that would be removed , the address sat and the date distinguished .
all were signed by Ul@@ timo Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could appro@@ ve any withdrawal .
then the responsibility has been transferred from there and the letters were more common .
Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the set @-@ set factory for two years , and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the un@@ used sugar tube factory . &quot;
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , waiting for retirement in another plant , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was involved in his will at the dis@@ closure of the factory , whose construction he helped .
with every part that he removed , he dismant@@ led one of his 31 work years .
the best developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important work producer was wi@@ ped out .
in many cases , there are no alternatives for work and services that were generated in the churches in which they found themselves .
we will never know whether at the Mamm@@ alog@@ y speech of 21 October 2002 , the then President found in the eyes of the present people saw that he had not been in operation for five years , everything would run well .
the price of the population for the closure of the sugar tubes
since 2004 , sugar cane is extracted only high by grinding .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ atist@@ a )
after two years , Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ i learned that there are many things to change , but not always for better if a factory is closed .
when the sugar tube factory lock , or better , when they began to run them , they heard also to asp@@ hal@@ ve the streets , this dis@@ advant@@ ageous to include other establishments .
without work in the region , and with advanced ages , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to search for other factories .
they became a spare parts .
without future perspective , many young people left the region on once again .
in the area a food factory created , its production is not even for the supply of the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene came back to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he started working .
Ne@@ un@@ und@@ ou@@ st bring the old soldiers to spend a ride of two thousand pes@@ o per month to spend the years in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ i .
O N@@ ene , a man black skin colour , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is not a good person , yet he awards the lies that told him .
they have been qu@@ eu@@ ing him for ten years .
N@@ ene goes with 65 years of age , not because it is missing at power , but because he is bitter .

the youth of the First Nations communities in the whole of Canada have dealt with topics that are important to them . they &apos;re doing by hip hop , thanks to a number of hiking workshops .
as part of the N &apos; we J@@ in@@ an tour since 2014 workshop manager mobile recording studios directly to schools and youth centers to teach youth groups song writing , recording , audio and video production and live appearances .
the original workshops were led by the ped@@ agogue David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and Quebec in North @-@ Quebec , with ten Cre@@ e communities and then worked with the Cre@@ e H@@ ip @-@ Hop Group The North@@ Stars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the workshop will thus make sure the young participant in convers@@ ations about &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cultural identity , language , conflict , love , self @-@ acceptance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or whatever &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sense &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos , in which the young people are the main actors .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia . they were invited to organ@@ ise similar workshops with the trunk of Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the U.S. state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
for example , this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ yo@@ o is told in the area of the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , called &quot; Highway 16 , &quot; which nearly two dozen were mostly indigenous young women or murdered .
the cases were largely implemented .
the next video of the Nem@@ o Cre@@ e First Nation used the motif of a video player to mediate , how important is the receipt of traditional customs and customs of war despite the flows through glob@@ alisation .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the yo@@ ungst@@ ers of First Nations is not always alleged to rule .
in the following song you have recorded the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation , the refra@@ ction is sung in Cre@@ e .
the young people attended a little help from Gary J@@ olly by the North@@ stars H@@ ip @-@ Hop acting to them a stub@@ born in dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e .
on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an , the St@@ anz@@ is is available in writing , likewise a translation into English , which is translated into German language :
sometimes I feel when no one would like to be interested in me
but I try to walk on earth my days on earth
this is the day you will get to our scre@@ am
because we lost our way as a youth in life
but I believe that we will be lifted up for one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life

in Japan you can see nearly every restaurant plastic dishes .
in order to show potential customers what exactly is on the menu , close to the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ u ( law @-@ by @-@ faith , &quot; plastic models of dishes &quot; ) are issued by every food that is served in this restaurant .
the customers see these plastic dishes and decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes .
in the K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi district of K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi , there are a multitude of these small companies that produce those plastic film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders in his film Tokyo G@@ a in front of more than 20 years ago .
for most Japanese these are these plastic dishes so usually that they are not able to stand out even more . a new trend turns them into a consp@@ ic@@ uous mobile phone accessories and other g@@ ad@@ gets .
at N@@ aver Mat@@ ome , the B@@ logger it@@ ini@@ i series of social media links and photos depic@@ t this unusual tw@@ ist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin purple .
now in a special sale : new with plastic used mobile phone t@@ apes , as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u Kauf@@ haus .
many of these artificial foods were turned into fl@@ ang@@ es collecting objects , such as in this case , e@@ at@@ ile mag@@ nets :
here are some Sho@@ es e@@ at@@ mag@@ nets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom in essence is increasingly more complex .
in this case , an imper@@ ial @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl ) was transformed into a mobile stand .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as a mobile support .
we have also made this part for the Tokyo exhibition in Tokyo .
and here is an apple , keeping your mobile phone :
designed to see like an apple , with a candle for the phone , this is a great design .
and this is just the beginning of an increasing arrival .
some phone support and mobile @-@ designers allow you to restore your own artwork . in this case , ik@@ ura or sal@@ mon will be used , a popular T@@ opping , which is served with white rice .
on Twitter some users had their doub@@ ts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is someone who say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wow , cool , now I can ench@@ ant my mobile with sal@@ mon ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
this interest in plastic dishes can also assume a less appet@@ ite form to surprise colleagues or family members un@@ pleasant .
our latest mobile stand has the shape of melting ice .
Moreover , there are also Reis@@ b@@ als ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , earrings and hand@@ bags made of dried laugh@@ s .
more sk@@ ur@@ r@@ ile plastic dishes can be found among : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s N@@ aver Mat@@ ome &apos;s blog post . or follow on Twitter to the h@@ ash@@ tag # . it &apos;s like that .
if you want to know more about the origin of this trends , then you will give you an insight into the K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi neighborhood , dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry . like e.g. with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin purple .
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes actually are made .
a Mexican project tells the story of the survivors of the Stru@@ g@@ gle against the organized crime
&quot; for the victims of fighting against the drug traff@@ icking . &quot;

in reports in@@ - and foreign media reports about the not@@ ori@@ ous &quot; fight against drug traff@@ icking in Mexico . these reflected not only in statistics . these reflected not at all , not the extent of human tragedy that brings this struggle with themselves .
the reporting on the drug bos@@ ses like El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ Ã¡n , Chief of the Sin@@ al@@ oa Cart@@ el , pressed the stories of the conflict in the background .
on the day after a violent incident , he looks really looking for a grief or to the churches that have learned to live with the pain .
behind each loan , behind each bone , the stories , sons and daughters , friends and partners are never able to heal their wo@@ unds , friends and partners .
this is why the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ ti@@ co has launched the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ un@@ a Vi@@ vi@@ r C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; with the drug traff@@ icking , &quot; ) is said to have one voice and told the stories of people who were killed in the fight between the prosecution authorities and cart@@ els .
animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ ti@@ co describes the project so :
organised crime lets us not only fear our lives .
the effects are much pro@@ found .
for example , if business close it , because they are threatened by drug traff@@ ic@@ kers and all municipalities have to leave many kilometers to buy something like milk .
the pain of the victims
&quot; &quot; &quot; a video with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vi@@ das que cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( german : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how fear lives &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) tells exactly these stories . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father , who finds secret graves after His Son .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ Ã­@@ guez that lost their father in just one day , their four brothers and sisters , their husband , and two of their ne@@ phe@@ w .
&quot; &quot; &quot; priest : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how every Sunday we prepare ourselves to the task that we have set ourselves , go to the graves after the people who loved us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in a electro@@ shop in El N@@ aran@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on October 15th he was back again , but he never returned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she &apos;s very hard for me , for I am now with three children who need a training . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is still my mother , which is also with me here .
at the moment it has no income .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you shall have the insurance of my Father , but she does not pay her , because it is a death certificate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; where should we get ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ un@@ a vivi@@ r con el nar@@ co will explain why the project is so important :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must show the conflicts of the international community , the frag@@ ility and the so@@ vereig@@ n@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ HB , a reader of Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ ti@@ co , wrote this article from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero .
their contribution remin@@ is@@ cent of us that violence should never consider normal as normal , in which form it occurs :
I have already know illness and sens@@ ation journ@@ alism since a few years .
I come to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks every day and see the cover page with pictures , which actually only come from a textbook for crimin@@ ology or out of specialists from specialists .
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I feel like if I am the only thing that is wi@@ sted or sad . it works as a lack of respect to the person who once belonged to this body .
I can not be in@@ different or consider this as normal .
she writes on :
no , it is not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old c@@ ousin already considering that he is big . and it is not normal that people listening to the &quot; hel@@ pl@@ aten &quot; of the offen@@ ders , when they go through the streets .
for me , it is that , as if they have lost those who lost any@@ body and those who are afraid to have something really happened .
I see our weakness , if stories are too blo@@ c numbers in a statistic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the facts of man is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students will be justified in a neigh@@ bors who &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rising &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think they are trying to speak of such trage@@ dies , if they are not stirring and still . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the article &quot; Four months of compres@@ sive in the main city area : like a family with thre@@ ats lo@@ oted in her business , until they were not only destroyed by the business , but also her family had torn apart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you think about everything you lost and remember how many people can change your whole life in just a few days . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the pain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pain is never going to keep the sad@@ ness when you are afraid , when you are alone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hab@@ its have changed , phone numbers .
we just contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
depending on each other , the better .
she completed her report with the words :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to be arrested for others , because they don &apos;t know when they will kill you or kill you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I asked me to dissolve my deep @-@ root feelings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the answers is no , because I don &apos;t forget how to weep . I must learn how to live with the pain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ Ã©r@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; The For@@ gotten Children of Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez : a generation by violence . &quot;
in the introduction he raises questions on how : who car@@ es for the child of a missed woman and a man who was murdered by organised crimes ?
how is it to grow up in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents take care of them .
Br@@ yan is a fatherless and he tells us how to make an egg coo@@ ks , potatoes , tort@@ illas warm and &quot; Ch@@ ich@@ i &quot; for the babies that are with him . this is his name for the preparation of bottle with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for every year .
but they are in@@ significant in comparison to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able to a boy for all the life of violence , who had to learn to live thereby .
when he was five years old , she said to him that his mother had disappeared .
but this was not the day that ended his childhood .
his childhood was over two years earlier , when he was only a few blocks away from his home , the bloody Lei@@ che of his father , who was shot by armed men from a previous car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation was seen in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 as a violent crime against organized crime and war with the already existing social problems in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world , due to the number of murder , according to the Federal Council for Public Safety and Government of the United States government .
in 2010 alone the Pro@@ sec@@ ution filed 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this corresponds to an average of 8.5 Mor@@ ning per day .
these are just a few hundred thousand stories which leaves the organized crime in Mexico and penet@@ rate it into the soul of the country .
only few stories live in view of always new head@@ lines . this project reminds us of those who are not allowed to forget .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vi@@ r C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; the data journ@@ alism project has launched in 2015 , whose goal is to display complex information behind the drug traff@@ icking in drug traff@@ icking , the country in the past four decades , in an comprehen@@ sible way .
if a picture is worth a thousand in@@ true words
&quot; Shar@@ ing is Car@@ ing &quot; from Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ User Ni@@ kl@@ as Viking ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) warning : this post and the pages , to which it is left , include images , on which violence is represented .
the fact check is important in a moment in which it is therefore to raise a rum@@ or or counter@@ f@@ eit .
but how is the years after something emerged in the first time ? content in social media , no matter whether true or true , tend to exist .
let us take this photo of a terrible accident in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) seven years ago .
since its first publication , it was used to have been mis@@ leading , trage@@ dies that actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false copy of image and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Draft News - deny that there is plenty of careful reporting on events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but there should have questions about our desire to look at news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 , a tank @-@ car crossed the place S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , til@@ ed and explo@@ ded . in addition , 230 people were killed .
after the civil war in Africa , the country &apos;s second largest country was neg@@ lec@@ ted and devast@@ ated . the streets in the region have become too close to dangerous paths , which were difficult to drive .
Trag@@ ically fell to the tan@@ kers to the victim .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; challenges &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Fire , the dozens of homes , including one cinema in the vicinity , which was full of people who illustr@@ ate the World Cup of World Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
houses toler@@ ated and carbon@@ ated cor@@ p@@ ses in the streets .
many people were burned to the ignor@@ ance .
an image with the title &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; from Im@@ g@@ ur users Myst@@ ical Monkey , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ more photos of the incident form the gray @-@ full scenes of this day .
the above is an example .
it shows rows of carbon@@ ized body which can be upgraded to the floor during people .
but the story does not find its end here .
more than the years the same photo was canc@@ eled several times on social media , blo@@ gs and other platforms , however , however , however , not in the context of the trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on January 3 , 2015 , fighters of the B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the ent@@ le@@ gen@@ ig@@ eri@@ an villages of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
Aug@@ enz@@ eu@@ es reported dra@@ stically from cru@@ ises to whom they had to flee .
houses and shops were burnt down and dead bodies in streets and we@@ dge .
there were reports that 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the numbers could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one remained back to number dead bodies , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a inhabitants of Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many were z@@ ou@@ sted , shot or burned .
only from using satellite imag@@ ery , the following time could be visu@@ ally displayed .
the reason for the attack remained un@@ solved , but the army &apos;s army at Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and trying to win the B@@ oko Har@@ am to win country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture emerg@@ es from the DR Kongo on , when it was evident as proof of the fact and the possible degree of attack was presented :
this is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place in Paris two days .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , these ab@@ usi@@ ve use of the picture from the DR Kongo is only one in a number of failure ; Africa Check has been documents of Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases the picture was brought as a letter for mass@@ ages .
another step further bring personal comments such as this example lu@@ ck@@ ily the image from the DR Kongo on the sources of mass media in connection to supply arguments .
the picture from S@@ ange joined the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar in connection with the fatal persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a flash message , published by the United Nations those who were looking to flee , rape and some dead , some are caused by burning .
while others reported by violence against Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Post@@ s , like the following , submitted these descriptions with photos from the DR Congo :
this picture comes from a Saudi Arabian news page that claimed 2012 , the President My@@ an@@ m@@ ars Th@@ ein had said , mon@@ ks and politicians had participated in the assassination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the painting of the DR Congo to su@@ stain these information .
the original contribution , on the latest on April 26 , 2017 , can be accessed here .
the other news organizations , AFP , as their source , had also attributed to Th@@ ein Th@@ ein His testimony , but did not so that the image of the DR Congo was in connection .
the worldwide reach of false information
traces of this false cou@@ pon went back to the years 2011 and 2012 and actually comes from anywhere in the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; using a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reverse image search &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you can see how far beyond limits can be exceeded . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a inver@@ ted picture search for the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 344 pictures below 18.@@ 8 billion images ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) , which is very similar to the reported picture of the DR Congo .
they origin@@ ate from a mixed mask of private pages , platforms , social media and community and national publications and are in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have rel@@ ayed false reports , some others attempts to escape the for@@ geri@@ es .
we have found examples of un@@ mist@@ ak@@ able use and they associated with the respective countries in connection , based on which side it was published , we want to represent a range of clear@@ er than by the language alone .
several examples from the listed below are linked to other cases ( in some cases ) can be used for abuse of abuse .
here are some cases which can now be sp@@ aw@@ ed now ( on the map in orange ) :

the or@@ an@@ arch@@ ed countries point on pages or server , more than the examples of for@@ f@@ eit detectors or fal@@ cons are still available .
the countries in grey are examples , according to the met@@ ad@@ ata and information that are available via Tin@@ Eye , probably also due to maturity .
as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .
Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what is happening in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the image from the DR Kongo on an online discussion forum was posted on an al@@ geri@@ er and interested Arab@@ s as part of a thread to the &quot; war of Buddhist against Muslims . &quot;

Canada , 2015 .
in this article a blo@@ g@@ ger from Quebec City was not only the counter@@ part , but also discussed the abuse of the image from the DR Congo in connection with Nigeria as well as further questions after intensive trage@@ dies ( in the DR Congo and beyond ) .

La Rep@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lica quoted as his source the Spanish News Agency EF@@ E ( where does not know if the original report contain the picture ) .
France , 2015 .
tri@@ wit@@ s after the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am like this here , who used the image from the DR Congo to illustr@@ ate the &quot; atro@@ cities of Islam , have seen totally interesting pages like Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster who contra@@ dic@@ ate this .
Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster named the in@@ correct use of the picture since 2011 in conjunction with Nigeria , then promoted by a post by the U.S. , anti@@ Islamic comm@@ ent@@ ator Pam@@ ela G@@ eller .

even within Nigeria the photo from the DR Kongo was a proof of the bombing of the B@@ oko Har@@ am in Kan@@ o in public discussion for@@ ums .
Malaysia , 2015 .
Malaysia offers two extreme example of an un@@ mist@@ ak@@ able use of the image from the DR Congo , with a T@@ we@@ et whose sympath@@ y towards the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , and elsewhere the claims to be persecuted , as well as the photos were failed .
Myanmar , 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the government of Myanmar released a right to create &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inten@@ tionally linked news and photos , which came to international media , international human rights organizations and governments in an attempt to create abuse in Myanmar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this asser@@ tion that has appeared entirely on English includes references to counter@@ f@@ eit images of rum@@ ours , the H@@ ate speech and of extreme @-@ related groups to present that Muslims will kill the Budd@@ hist@@ s and elsewhere ( what is often widely used by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) .

this post , who judged the members of the Russian @-@ orthodo@@ x church , clearly shows that the DR of the DR Congo is NOT Muslims who kill Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news page claimed that the President of Myanmar Th@@ ein had taken himself from being in 2012 that mon@@ ks and politicians had been involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the painting of S@@ ange .
the article was updated in 2014 and currently includes the picture of this release .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article of 2014 about students who had been updated by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , published in the latest news page An@@ Ã¡@@ l@@ is@@ is Digital , has expressly declared that the picture is not taken by the red@@ ness , but it claims that it was a &quot; similar d@@ ag@@ ic attack &quot; attack .
as the picture later , in connection with the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am , in 2015 , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to re@@ vo@@ ke that links to Nigeria .
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Y@@ an@@ Ä±@@ y@@ a@@ Y@@ an@@ Ä±@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria bur@@ ns that sleeps the world ) .
the DR of the DR Congo comes with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and dissolved a discussion under Muslims after the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 and the stop on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted to achieve that their communities found these events that were suspected in the name of the Islam@@ s , an increased attention .
United States , 2015 .
the picture was wit@@ ched as a cover for the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 ( and more than 9.@@ 300 times ) . but the messages that were connected with it were not taken in any religious context .
instead , the goal was to judge attention to the relative number of the deaths and a comparison of media coverage compared with Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( Maltese ) , 2014 .
after a message having been written in circulation by an &quot; Father Juan Carlos Mart@@ os &quot; on the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , discussion for@@ ums , such as this here on Vietnamese and explained it to a false message .
from the Embassy in which the DR contained in the DR Kongo on , the organization of the Clar@@ et@@ ine mission@@ aries and Father Juan Carlos Mart@@ os were dist@@ ressed .
there are further confirmed examples of in@@ correct use of the picture from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
at other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and pages in the following countries ( based on the portfolio in grey ) , Tin@@ Eye has also been extended but are not completely re@@ tra@@ ce@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , the Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with UR@@ Ls and time / date stamps exist on the Web@@ cra@@ wler and occur using image file names in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which appeared only after the original accident of 2010 , the photo ultimately may not include a correct description , but the original fee is not available or accessible .
frames and images
there are two strong subjects or frames ( h@@ ein@@ gs ) that go through these postal . the first frame is focusing on religion .
the picture was used in relation to greater discussions about silence in connection with the assassin@@ ations of Christians through Muslims or the Defense of Muslims - the murder of Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hist@@ s .
a second fr@@ aming was used to discuss the image , such as African lives in comparison to a European or French life .
religion is important to understand and the value of human life is essential . therefore it &apos;s worth to investigate how images are used in connection with these efforts .
a deeper question is however , what happens if reading these pictures cannot give longer faith .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with social media , there are many people who are un@@ intended to exercise the water round about a tragedy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sug@@ ars this atmosphere of the false and false information that is true atro@@ cities and tast@@ es of what actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and in Myanmar ?
the spread of the images has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
an argument is that the retention of pictures of a ref@@ usal to recogn@@ ise the tragedy . sometimes these pictures will be demanded by the victims itself .
at the same time , the concern is that del@@ ight@@ for@@ ci@@ bly images and viewers are des@@ iring to emp@@ iri@@ ze emp@@ ath@@ y ( such as this study , which influence the for@@ ci@@ ble media to help others ) .
while there are some significant represent@@ ations in news media reports , fact , fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reports .
techn@@ ologists experiment , because with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; F@@ ake News &quot; . they will thoroughly re@@ prove about situation in which a picture is slightly sug@@ ars , but it does actually be solved in the context or completely un@@ mist@@ ak@@ able manner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an investigation of in@@ correct sub@@ sid@@ y should also take into account as international as international . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ er@@ able &quot; blog revealed the uni@@ qu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo of Andy Simmons was using the CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
one blog with the name Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ er@@ able ( e. g. un@@ ce@@ able ) ende@@ av@@ oured to offer voice of words from around the world that are difficult or not to translate at all .
such words are available in each language : they press certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these unnecessary words are already well known today ( like the famous Portuguese car@@ eg@@ de ) and others , which are deeply ro@@ oted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish s@@ me@@ esa ) .
but all contra@@ dic@@ ts to any attempt of a simple translation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a word or expression &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not sufficient to understand why a full explanation and sometimes a little context is necessary to understand what is meant with this one word . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these unique words were collected for a full time in an online list .
most of these lists deal with Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , during the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ er@@ able &quot; Steven Bird , decided to concentrate on small tongues .
in the blog you can find the words of V@@ anu@@ at@@ u &apos;s V@@ anu@@ at@@ u , as :
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Bem@@ Ã¼@@ h to your parents in recognition of how to have ende@@ av@@ oured in your younger years .
words and words in the H@@ uns@@ ric language , which are spoken in parts of Brazil , as :
&quot; kw@@ adi &quot; - the convenience or sl@@ oth , which one feels like during the cold days in the sun .
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words about his blog :
you grin@@ der other cultures , un@@ veil other sc@@ ank@@ ets and we@@ aves our cur@@ i@@ osity .
sometimes you influence how we analy@@ ze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this site , and show more of these &quot; un@@ re@@ plac@@ eable &quot; words and show how different , precious and impressive these small languages are .
speakers of the &quot; Treasure Languages , &quot; which are appreciated by Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ er@@ ally , are invited to download your favorite words here .

how Sri Lanka with the worst flood disaster of the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently looking forward to the worst flood disaster in this decade .
triggered by the Mon@@ sun , which normally sets at the end of May , are caused by strong ra@@ ids the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ alu O@@ ya in 15 districts on the south and west of the country .
according to the opinion of the cat@@ ast@@ roph@@ ic center of Sri Lanka , May 28 , 2017 , 126 people were killed and barely hundred people are missed due to the floods and slaughter win@@ ches .
more than 400 000 people have been affected since the last Friday ( 26 May ) and approximately 100 000 people have been brought to 304 safe position .
the ra@@ ins were left slowly on Saturday ( May 27 ) , and the circumstances in some areas were slowly left .
health and hygiene ratios of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected areas and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following images and videos give an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :
flood water in Ta@@ wal@@ ama town with water levels of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter user such as A@@ zz@@ am Ame@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et deliver regular updates to the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the catastrophe .
Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly flu@@ ent wor@@ ms the den@@ ess crisis , Save the Children , after other ra@@ ins are already on the road .
today , the Nel@@ u@@ wa Bus increased in the flood , water level up to 6 metres . village Mor@@ ago@@ da in G@@ alle also over@@ flow@@ ed due to yesterday &apos;s waterfalls of Mor@@ og@@ oda El@@ a .
the Luftwaffe has provided five aircraft for rescue operations and further five are made to transport of emergency supplies which were finished in their floo@@ ded villages .
also different organizations and start@@ ups have provided themselves to help .
Facebook pages like Help Flo@@ od V@@ IC@@ TI@@ MS in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka deliver important information about flood situation and humanitarian aid .
if you need any search and lif@@ egu@@ ards for their operations , please call the number 07@@ 7@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 .
for everyone who wants to don@@ ate dry food and vital goods for flood victims -
we are today in the area around Kel@@ en@@ i@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call the number 07@@ 77@@ 44@@ 9@@ 29 or 07@@ 77@@ 84@@ 38@@ 41 , if animals need help in this area .
the tax@@ ir@@ u@@ f @-@ App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their s@@ iting data with the help of the app , so that the Cat@@ ast@@ oph@@ enz@@ entrum is informed .
last year after the catastrophe of the tropical storm Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me a &quot; High Water Aid &quot; button , which allowed it to pick up a vehicle to pick up a vehicle to collect assistance services and donations . these were then forwarded to the sr@@ il@@ an@@ ical Red Cross .
in the same way , they led a &quot; S@@ OS &quot; button which had more than thousand qu@@ eries and 150 successful bo@@ ret@@ ement actions across the flood .
the united efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , among which several social media platforms are fully exhau@@ sted , carry residents in need in need to provide assistance in safety and aff@@ ord .
this has prevented the loss of other lives , with the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way to restore the norm@@ ality .
Muslims who cannot see it
the Women &apos;s March on 21st of January 2017 in San Francisco .
photo of Sah@@ ar Hab@@ ib G@@ ha@@ zi .
use ap@@ t.@@ Dam@@ as in January I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neigh@@ bor and love friend .
I confi@@ de to her four years old daughter , she tru@@ sts in her children ; she is my rock in a surf .
in the last minute , we call for women &apos;s rights .
in the next post we tend rights to trans@@ gender .
we are located in a sea of rain@@ sh@@ iel@@ ding and people , some hold the iconic image of a woman with head@@ ache high , bound up from an American flag , other sk@@ ili@@ ating slo@@ gan@@ s against Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my gir@@ l@@ friend look at me , saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things do not concern thee , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslims ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I already led these entertainment .
people , with whom I work or people who have known me since years , separate me - the Sah@@ ar that they know - of the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has been established in their performance .
she mus@@ li@@ fy me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims around the world .
we don &apos;t see all equally .
we pract@@ ising our religion .
we identify ourselves to be a Muslim , in different art . but som@@ eh@@ ow we are all plug@@ ged in the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is well constructed in our collective presentation of the art that as soon as Muslims who do not custom@@ ize it there .
dra@@ fts to be mus@@ li@@ ated
I won &apos;t stand alone .
that &apos;s even the poet , whose poetry is selling in America : Rum@@ i .
what images do you see in the sense if you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
as Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an orthodo@@ x mus@@ li@@ ous pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Kor@@ an and Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died , the centre of his poetry .
but in the Western conception , the religion was removed from Rum@@ is , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry .
this del@@ etion makes a major part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another exists in the reduc@@ tive images of Muslims who have been colonial books for centuries .
this cur@@ few image language is determined by the dark men whom you should fear and the exotic woman that should be saved .
the ground@@ breaking Palestinian scientist Edward S@@ aid dismant@@ led the story behind these pictures in the 1970s .
but these pictures also continued today .
they continue our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood .
I have been working for thirteen years in the news industry and I have seen , like this powerful , faul@@ ty nar@@ rati@@ fy our news@@ feeds .
this Nar@@ rati@@ v over@@ sh@@ adows the reality in which the last three decades of nine Muslim women have led their countries , while the USA could not even chose their first female presidential candidate .
this Nar@@ rati@@ v f@@ ails to recogn@@ ise that if French , Muslim women are forced to bear their heads in public buildings and forced to cover their whole body to cover their entire body , which both are both sides of the same medal .
a powerful group exercises its &quot; control &quot; on the &quot; other . &quot;
this strong nar@@ rati@@ ve weak@@ ened Muslim women who lead movements for change .
in addition , it sees that the first Muslim Pra@@ yers were spoken to American soil of Afri@@ cans , who had been carried away with slave hi@@ ps .
it del@@ etes the existence of Que@@ er Muslims .
this Nar@@ rati@@ v has deeply under@@ gone deeply and in@@ accurate , that often Sik@@ h @-@ men and children are to become the aim of anti @-@ tim@@ ic attacks and ch@@ ic@@ kers .
due to these stories , which we tell and due to the kind , in which we tell it , Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia is not just fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; other . &quot;
belong to the 1.7 billion
in the news industry we can do more than just stories that are based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create Nar@@ r@@ ative that help us to understand the world .
and my industry is phenom@@ en@@ sely failed to capture the 1.7 billion nar@@ rati@@ fication .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we have failed , where seven million Muslims make up the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Relig@@ ious &quot; Relig@@ ious group in America &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than one @-@ third of the entire Muslim population are African Americans .
six of ten American Muslims belong to the immigrants in the first generation that origin@@ ate from 77 countries .

my mother laid her first jew@@ ellery design in 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; Wol@@ k@@ enk@@ r@@ atz@@ er were supported by the Muslim , American st@@ atics from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
at that time , the Sky@@ lines of the world thought that my parents were un@@ disputed Muslims and Americans .
but am I un@@ bri@@ dged Muslims and American ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes if I ask people why I don &apos;t ask eating meat , I say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of my Muslim recipes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of my Muslim recipes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from respect for P@@ epp@@ a W@@ utz &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I sh@@ ear , we don &apos;t wear all pocket gl@@ ans with us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must also be no the@@ ological experts to be a Muslim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be selected almost always for additional security checks at the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim schol@@ ars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists who are proud to fight against Islam .
these lies are produced by a well @-@ lubri@@ cated Islam@@ ist , thy@@ roid , Th@@ ink Tanks and experts for Fal@@ con information produced , which is a Muslim image , which is a Muslim ; or what Islam is , manip@@ ulated .
due to the stories that we tell and due to the kind , in which we tell it , Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia is in more than just a stranger , who calls a towel .

I want to explain that .
I was born when Muslim was born when I was four years old when I was four years old when I was four years old in a Pro@@ visional mosque in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
if social scientist describe religious life , they attack them on the following terms : faith , behavior and affili@@ ation .
my mus@@ li@@ ous faith and behavior may not always be visible , but they &apos;re there .
perhaps my gir@@ l@@ friend would see my neigh@@ bor , my rock in bran@@ ding that I am Muslim , when it could look at 15 meters of concrete and air that can separate our houses .
she would see the sole rit@@ ual with my daughter , when I cra@@ cked them in my arms and her Arab verses to protect the Kor@@ an , defe@@ ating the Kor@@ an .
I will pick three times each of them .
I pray you , that it is protected from evil , the ev@@ ild@@ o@@ er , that one can see and evil that can &apos;t see .
my mus@@ li@@ ous belief may not always be visible , but my Muslim citizenship is always part of my shadow .

it &apos;s the picture of her that I close my eyes close : nano , surrounded by their full and un@@ finished paintings with many book@@ marks , a book with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen cap@@ tures which it can be very elabor@@ ately .
Muslims said to be the prayers , which she said to me when I have a bad day .
Muslims to be in mind , how they taught me to refer to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a people who has been colon@@ ised by a &quot; Empire &quot; &quot; Empire , &quot; which has established a company with the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; British Ost@@ ini@@ ar@@ ships @-@ Kom@@ pan@@ ie , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has a deep importance to God , to my Lord . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in the middle of the modern Islam and over the independence K@@ ash@@ mir@@ s , N@@ ana J@@ aan writes about his family in the city of India . K@@ ash@@ mir , family that he could not close his arms in half a century .
citizenship is to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians , whose families were torn apart from col@@ oni@@ alists , who have divided the Muslim world as at the game risk .
Muslims to be aware that in the last two centuries Europeans have destroyed all over four Muslim countries . &quot;
it means to know that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of history was subjected from a century to a Muslim country .

it means that fourteen years ago , the most powerful army of the world , with troops which apart from the Ant@@ arc@@ tica , had been spread to Iraq in order to pursue weapons of mass destruction that were not exist@@ ent .
it means to know that more than half a half million Ira@@ q@@ is was buried under the deser@@ ts of the war .
an American Muslim Brotherhood means that the self @-@ stroke rate among veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 per cent since 2001 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it means that if a tragedy will pun@@ ish the US and carries a Muslim name , the story will be four times more than a history with a white attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it means to know that in the four@@ teenth year of the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , of a liberated black slaves with the name of Bil@@ al .
it means to know that two hundred years ago , an African Islam@@ ist called Bil@@ ali Muhammad would be reconc@@ iled and brought to this country .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the nar@@ rati@@ v of the 1.7 billion is hi@@ des more possibilities than a magic cubes , but is represented in the reduction of doub@@ t@@ ness &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

structural Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia consists of the Muslim regist@@ r@@ ers , who started with President Bush and extended under President Obama .
it is in continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it exists in the emig@@ rant officials who occupies an five @-@ year old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it is in a country that colon@@ izes its borders against people from just the countries who bom@@ bed it .
it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; no @-@ Fly list , &quot; which takes away largely Arab@@ s and Muslims .
there are the wars that we perform and the bombs we throw up to Muslim countries .
due to the stories that we tell and due to those who are not telling , we are here today .
in a study with the title Asc@@ ent of Man , scientists of North@@ western University participants showed a scientifically real image and desired them to assess groups on a scale of 1 to 100 regarding evolution .
Muslims received the lowest score .
the conversation we must lead
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are too deep to ab@@ stain the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are decades to detect the roots of our fears and mis@@ er@@ able and dangerous expres@@ sive prints , which we under@@ take in our news actions .
at least , there is a growing movement , given by American Muslims within the media industry , which tries to capture our most multiple ident@@ ities and forgotten history .
the po@@ d@@ cast lake Som@@ e@@ thing , Say Som@@ e@@ thing of Bu@@ zz@@ is ; the vir@@ al vide@@ os@@ ery Secret Li@@ ves ; Sh@@ ust@@ er Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative , several Muslim authors and Ms Mar@@ vel , the Pakistan , American Super@@ hel@@ din - all this makes me hope .

but I wor@@ ried about this difficult global newspaper point in which we are located .
and this moment has consequences to go out more than 1.7 billion .
there is a reason that con@@ spiracy the@@ or@@ ist who existed in the dark corners of the Internet , now the White House .
they are exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally grown , because Muslims have made Muslims &quot; others . &quot;
there is another group that has been exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally grown , by making the &quot; others &quot; created .
a few years ago it had not yet been given ; now they have ruled great areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am concerned about the re@@ alities and the history , which I was not aware of it when I was so old now my daughter , but those who have made me today into an unknown Muslim .
things I have left here as a bread cra@@ ck track in my speech .
things you might wake up memories , because in all the inter@@ sec@@ tions , which makes our humanity , may watch a story where someone is made to one &quot; others . &quot;
just now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley can find conversation in context of the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia .
more than a hundred university graduates speak about our problems with the &quot; other &quot; , &quot; structural rac@@ ism &quot; and &quot; American milit@@ ar@@ ism . &quot;
but these are not terms , with which we are usually t@@ oss to our schools or read our newspapers in our newspapers .

we all need to ask ourselves , why ?
why do I address this T@@ ED@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars are led and people through the monkeys of the other &quot; in the public presentation , four decades ago his scientist was employed .
we need ourselves to provide ourselves un@@ comfortable questions after the role of whose , consci@@ ously and I could imagine a new future while we bom@@ bed a new future while he already bom@@ bed countries and &quot; to others &quot; people are bom@@ bed far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion .
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for nar@@ r@@ ative art wants to preserve urban lingu@@ istic variety
history count , by Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ users Daniele Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be an option to occur here and now despite a language barrier using someone ?
for Steven Bird and Ro@@ by@@ n Perry , founder of the &quot; Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling ( T@@ LS ) is a chance of stories in their original language a possible response .
global Vo@@ ices reported some more recently about a different initiative by Steven Bird , the unbe@@ ar@@ able blog .
here , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and memor@@ able the language variety of great cities .
indeed , urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oak@@ land has been in the United States where T@@ LS has already carried out since 2015 events , the risk that small and not quite as small languages are not admitted to the children born there .
for the makers of the project :
the mass mortality of the world can be avoided when we create cities that accept diversity - safe spaces , in which inhabitants are not forgotten , who they are to be attributed to .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hearing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening to understand &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these events instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to hear , feel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to feel &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format , stor@@ yt@@ ellers choose their history at first in their own language and translate or explain it in English .
even if the participants are not professional stor@@ yt@@ ellers , their dev@@ otion therefore lead to their dev@@ otion , and their presentation that the audience should be prevented .
they call laughter and emot@@ ions , when the language is no longer a barrier .
for example , the following video shows a traditional story from Burkina Faso , which is told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the stor@@ yt@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou does also take the opportunity to explain their country &apos;s typical customs of art .
in another event John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the move from the bun@@ ny and the avian in speech Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
after having declared the importance of his F@@ ak , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is this to say to an audience what your language does not understand ? &quot; with a wide Gr@@ in@@ sen he divi@@ des his feeling of in@@ comprehen@@ si@@ vity :
they have heard !
they were atten@@ tive ...
they were all with me !
so far , the Events of Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling held in three cities , and the organ@@ izers hope to expand this . all those who are inspired by the project can come into contact with T@@ LS in order to organize their own stor@@ yt@@ ellers .
Puerto Rico calls from the USA re @-@ fixing the state debt
the aim of a re @-@ audit of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which took part in a mass demonstration on April 3 , 2017 , participated in a mass demonstration ; the march started from the North African Capit@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and ran until the Plaza de Col@@ Ã³n in the old town of San Ju@@ ans .
it was proclaimed by the group &quot; Fr@@ ente Ci@@ ud@@ ad@@ ano p@@ or la Au@@ or@@ Ã­a de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( civil Front for the neur@@ on@@ ary of debt ) and the ec@@ om@@ en@@ ical church in Puerto R@@ os .
the advoc@@ ate of the debts of the debt also submitted a petition on the official website of the White House of the United States .
this is your claim :
Puerto R@@ os people demands that the politicians , banks and government agencies that are responsible for the debt , are responsible for their corruption .
we call for a financial examination and a lead committee without personal interests in public debt , with a firm to re@@ mun@@ eration for the economy in favour of the economy .
we will be de@@ pressed and supp@@ ressed .
the people of Puerto R@@ os refused to pay a debt that is not her .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pension@@ ers will not find pension payments .
we demand instant measures .
the island - not into the territory of integrated High@@ est territory of the USA - suffer from a serious financial crisis .
thus , the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; an NGO independent non @-@ profit organization with a focus on soci@@ o@@ economic development , a law on state responsibility , as an alternative to the existing state view .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis Puerto R@@ os requires a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the outside set measures , without the participation and the convic@@ tion of the citizens , shall be rejected by people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the demonstration took the name of &quot; dessert for light and truth . &quot;
here are some impressions :

more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supp@@ orters and the members assume the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions which he has made an open net .
at this year &apos;s re : public@@ a , the annual conference on digital culture , which is held in Berlin , dedicated to the event of the # Free@@ Bas@@ le campaign .
MÃ©@@ l@@ anie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist who is based in France based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ Ã¼h@@ ling , Managing Director at Book Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive Inqu@@ isition , The Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive Inqu@@ isition ( The Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive After@@ research ) .
the book , published in the last year , and is licensed here and contains a number of inserts which deal with free culture under the oppression of oppression .
it is a homage to Bas@@ sel and his work .
in the introduction it is :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this book would like to be rebuilt as movements for Free knowledge and what the true costs are linked to which this is connected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
activ@@ ist , artist , designers , developer , researchers and authors who have worked on the movements of Free knowledge , have a page to look over the fog who gives our news@@ feeds and create something sense from our various experiences .
this book is an attempt to liber@@ ate Bas@@ le Kh@@ art@@ ou@@ il , beloved and celebrated Internet volunteers , who has been detained in Syria since 15 March 2012 .
his name was cancelled from the list of A@@ dra prison in which he sat on 3 October 2015 .
since then we have no information about his current state or position .
the introductory part of his book with the title collective remembrance gives his friends and his family a voice that want to move on his release , and those who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom .
see how Bas@@ sel has a high price for his participation in a free culture , has many of us to think about their own dest@@ in@@ ies , actions and decisions .
why Are We Here ?
what have we decided ?
what have we abandoned in this process by means of extreme belie@@ fs ?
the web developer of open source and digital activity has been in custody of Syrian government agencies since March 2012 .
in October 2015 Bas@@ sel was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution , transferred to an unknown location .
his wife , au@@ tho@@ ress and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi , reported that the &quot; Military Police of Bas@@ sel reported on the basis of a &quot; strictly covered &quot; precepts of the military court from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
G@@ ha@@ zi reported that it was cont@@ acted on November 12 , 2015 by people who were presented itself as the Insider of the Assad government and they were informed of a alleged death sentence against their husband .
his residence and state remains unknown .
a pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bas@@ sel played a crucial role in it to expand access to the Internet and to know about the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and currently elabor@@ ates the lad@@ der of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bas@@ sel , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps there was none of the bass @-@ prototype as the work , which he began to design with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around the year 2005 to virtually design the ancient ruins of Pal@@ m@@ yr@@ as .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the way of numerous civ@@ il@@ izations and melt Greek @-@ Roman architecture types with hi@@ es@@ ful traditions and personal influences .
Bas@@ sel was not yet able to know that ten years after having begun with this work , the IS would accompl@@ ish this architecture that not only em@@ bodies the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world .
this po@@ etic journey into the digital archae@@ ology and the conservation has created a time capsule created for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future of inv@@ alu@@ able value .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trag@@ ically , Bas@@ sel has not yet been able to close this project yet . &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others even during his time in prison :
I have spent my whole life to dream by freedom , and he taught me to embra@@ ce her .
I &apos;m simply overwhel@@ med , when I call his name .
Bas@@ sel brought me in English , even when he was already in prison .
I have lear@@ nt to read , write and speak English .
he always has his knowledge with each shared , who has asked . he has taught others to read , write and speak English .
Bas@@ sel opened my door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
he also taught others , as they are using computers , at least in theory , without knowing in her hands .
G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Warten ) , a Pro@@ sab@@ ot@@ ch , which she was written in custody for the years 2012 and 2015 .
Bas@@ sel and N@@ our@@ a have worked together in the book for a year .
they tast@@ es the lyrics of him when she visited him and he translated them from the United Arab in English .
the book is licensed free .
envelope by Y@@ ous@@ sef Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to public domain .
here is an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a with the title &quot; It is happening &quot; :
it &apos;s happening at every visit ,
that I sin@@ sin@@ ful in the world of ench@@ anting eyes ,
that I left the better thing in the moment , in which we embra@@ ced us ,
that any of the dangers might be no matter ,
everyone of the f@@ ences , bo@@ ilers and gu@@ ardi@@ ans
I forget the prison day
and I go into every detail of your voice and words .
I carry with passion for me ,
if your eyes say good@@ bye
and I leave another piece of my soul with you ...
I return to my lon@@ el@@ iness ,
to recover all the moments ,
and on your absence to weep and smile .
I create myself to return soon ...
G@@ ha@@ zi wrote on the first anniversary of the arrest of Bas@@ sel :

and you are still in the cage of the monster
Bass@@ els History is not unique in Syria .
according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) , since the beginning of protests against the regime of Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad have disappeared more than 65@@ ,000 people .
those who were arrested or suffering from violence through the regime were tor@@ tured or executed by the regime .
by 2016 , Am@@ nesty International has died at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians in detention since 2011 .
the stories of many other people remain un@@ unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices Community is calling for release of Bas@@ sel since 2012 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we repeat our call for the hope we must do this for the last time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mozambique : due to corruption Ver@@ ur@@ gy director after release of corruption back to previous post
in 1990 , Mos@@ ambique responded with anger on a corruption of corruption in which a government member returned to the workplace in the state of government , which corruption was committed .
this includes Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza , who was arrested in 2008 and together with four other accused counts of 54 million met@@ ic@@ al ( roughly 800 000 Euro ) for 22 years in prison .
the money was from public funds in the airports of Mozambique , whose council is a member of Cam@@ b@@ aza between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ b@@ aza was released in 2016 for good leadership and immediately requested his return to the company , what happened on April 19 .
in accordance with the Pro@@ curator &apos;s Office of the Republic that uses the motion for Cam@@ b@@ aza , there was not an obst@@ acle course for Cam@@ b@@ aza , to return to his old post as the company was not discipl@@ ined after his detention .
however , many inhabitants don &apos;t have the promotion .
the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Bu@@ da@@ de P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lica , shortly C@@ IP ) , a local institution that sets up for public transparency , condemned the decision to re@@ locate the company &apos;s decision in an interview with the Deutsche Welle .
provides a set@@ back against corruption and clari@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a step in regard to the efforts of our legal system , so the C@@ IP .
what we are aware of it is that the company should have a discipl@@ ines of discipl@@ ines against the conflic@@ ting might .
the company was silent , however , induced a reasonable legal steps for the application of the respective functions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Eg@@ Ã­@@ dio V@@ az , a major voice in the Mos@@ ambique of social media , ref@@ uses this behaviour as well as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contra@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
when Cam@@ b@@ aza was a competent type , it would be consultant after being condemned to a prison sentence and of which the half has been sent .
he could have paid talks and motiv@@ ating spe@@ eches , he could advise and his image editing .
but since he is in@@ competent , he has dist@@ illed to be re@@ integrated into the company which he helped to add damage .
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ aza is paid for his silence .
re@@ vocation !
bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil says the director does not occup@@ y no mor@@ als :
Cam@@ b@@ aza was rewarded by the state because he did not believe him , because someone claims to reward someone this in such way that has already been solid to the state .
Cam@@ b@@ aza is missing to return to Mor@@ al and serve to serve the state , * he already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead it has only served on the state instead .
Cam@@ b@@ aza , the state , used as a hand@@ some of an in@@ exhau@@ st@@ ible money source and the state itself , this man was tired , who was sum@@ mon@@ ed and finally convicted to a long sentence .
hon@@ est@@ ly I don &apos;t know why this man was rewarded .
Fran@@ ce@@ y Ze@@ Ãº@@ te is preferred to remember the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el to remember that a thief is in prison :
th@@ ieves also belong to the prison of Sam@@ ora Mach@@ ete , the Mos@@ ambique will not only be remembered as first independent president , but also as a sharp , gradu@@ al den@@ ying , and by the case - prophet@@ ical Red@@ ner .
one of his most famous child represent@@ ations was , as he confirmed that &quot; an ambitious man was able to sell his amb@@ itions for his amb@@ itions , his own interest . &quot;
Sam@@ ora said : &quot; I don &apos;t know if a ambitious man changes , my experience shows that it is not so . he changes the tac@@ tics but he turns not from his amb@@ itions .
an ambitious man is de@@ crimin@@ ally . &quot;
in Twitter the reactions were also le@@ aning :
at 22 years in prison , Cam@@ b@@ aza was sentenced to 22 years in prison , and he sat free .
and today it sets him the company , with which he disc@@ ern@@ ment , again under the contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ kov@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - Refle@@ ction ( @ az@@ mal _ Raf@@ ik ) 12 May 2017
Em@@ ild@@ o Sam@@ bo from the magazine @ Ver@@ da@@ de ( to dt . : @ truth ) states that crime was paid in Mozambique :

Facebook is blo@@ cked the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cen@@ sored many users
the Bur@@ m@@ ical word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means chick@@ pe@@ a or sk@@ ip age .

&quot; &quot; &quot; according to information from Facebook users in Myanmar , the known social network took their postal from the net because they contained the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the source of the word is still discussed , it is normally used to refer to humans , Indian origin , or generally used as an ad@@ jective &quot; In@@ Indian . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook is addressed the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Bur@@ m@@ ese script ) as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of hate Burma in Burma at the social network . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements gave the word to an extremely ab@@ dom@@ ination K@@ onn@@ ot@@ ation .
in particular , it is a word that is usually used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists than hate crimes against Muslims who constitute a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in their efforts to fight against humanity in Myanmar , the company has made a lot of sen@@ su@@ ed content on its platform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may normally be associated with rac@@ ism , but the word on itself is not calling for Hass@@ elt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that , in which they discussed the use of the Word , or doubt the purpose of purpose of use , to be cen@@ sored .
in addition there are several bur@@ mes@@ ian words with basic mean@@ ings that have the same book sequence such as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , chair at Bur@@ m@@ ese also wrote &apos; Kal@@ ar ht@@ a@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters , as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ar ka@@ ar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ ag@@ utz@@ er A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at stated the various mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Cal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post of my friends was today deleted because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
but he had asked his friends on the spiritual way , whether they could smell as he could lin@@ t his back pain , saying a word game .
the set ku la - &quot; C@@ ure &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) to Bur@@ m@@ ese - resem@@ bles the rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different .
there were several reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
Z@@ in Win is the opinion that she will decrease in Hass@@ elt radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook analy@@ zers ra@@ ps before it will spread all the post @-@ suspic@@ ion , rac@@ ism .
Facebook del@@ etes the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; not manually .
it automatically filters the Word .
the Automatic will not understand what you are writing to Fac@@ eb@@ ook .
what it was supposed to do , is the post carefully analy@@ ze and control it by check the following words .
for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar Ht@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; ( design ) .
the good thing is that this three @-@ seater nation@@ alists , the Hass@@ elt , will receive a rather good lesson .
now it is time to circum@@ cise their nation@@ alism .
while the action will send a strong signal to all , the Hass@@ elt are not able to keep the efficiency of this strategy .
the experiences of social networks in China , such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ chat , have demonstrated that the users are often going to start on social networks , a new word or an alternative writing of the words to express their views .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the author of A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described as Facebook began to delete his postal , when he would only express his friends , that the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; is ex@@ iled by the social network : &quot; &quot; &quot;
... when I was aware of this new directive on Facebook , I made a post to inform my Facebook friends that the Word is closed .
ir@@ on@@ ically , my post office was removed from Facebook and told me the li@@ ken , post and parts of content for 24 hours , because the post &quot; fac@@ ebook community standards did not escape . &quot;
Facebook has a number of Post@@ s away from people who have no negative inten@@ tions or trying to show their opinions on the hate radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Murphy wrote that his post has been removed , which has nothing to do with Hass@@ elt :
post without Hass@@ em by Facebook .
in the post , the author shared his mind that extreme nation@@ alism and religious Fund@@ ament@@ alism emerged in the country .
Chan My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook would have more to do before the beginning of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community should ask :
Facebook may have a good intention to reduce rac@@ ism in Burma through its platform , but it does not work .
such words have to be cen@@ sored only will bring more hat@@ red within the different communities .
in addition , it seems to have this without any local context or technical support and have banned the words such as &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; inheritance curr@@ y . &quot;
even when they found out that they did mist@@ akes , they did not attempted to am@@ end the post@@ ulate post@@ s .
if they only have somewhat more respect for the 15 million benefits , which had a great turnover that would be great .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fac@@ eb@@ ooks automatic c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship has provided support for a lot of sp@@ lot among users . &quot; &quot; &quot;
instead of making it to feel like Facebook users are fun and write the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of Hass@@ elt to see if their postal addresses are taken from the net .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook Post@@ s , which contains no Hass@@ elt , but nonetheless removed :

over the past five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious foundations , the social networks have used to expand their voices and their influence , has increased .
among other things Hass@@ elt is to heat the violence in the congregations in Myanmar in addition , especially in Rak@@ h@@ ine territory , where strug@@ gles were forced to flee between Muslims and Budd@@ hist@@ s .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised for his failure to critic@@ ises the Hass@@ ler on his Bur@@ m@@ ese pages .
but rather than simply h@@ oo@@ king the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have better looked forward to context as focused on code @-@ concentrated initiatives and learned from them .
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tobago has conclu@@ de with the children before
a wedding ring in the sand .
photo of Der@@ ek Gav@@ ey , CC B@@ Y 2.0 .
the child before is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago .
on 9 June 2017 , the State of the country unanimously approved a law which should offer to this practice , so the married age is now at 18 .
before this change of marriage cerem@@ onies held various members of religious communities in practice , and in May 2016 , brother Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ad Mah@@ ar@@ aj was gathered , a group of representative of the various religious groups of the country , that the state should not inter@@ f@@ ere , since that , age not the maturity . &quot;
this happened on the fact that Trinidad and Tobago has defined a contractual partner of the UN children &apos;s Convention on Human Rights than , &quot; every man under 18 years . &quot;
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children who were already married to 15 percent in Trinidad and Tobago 2.8 percent , and with 18 , it was 8.1 percent .
in 2011 the statistical Central Office of the country confirmed that of 1997 @-@ 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19 .
online pet@@ itions and social media movements , which were con@@ tested to con@@ serve laws to children before , followed by the foot and rejoiced with great support . und@@ ou@@ b@@ tedly they will test this result .
nevertheless , all ran smoothly .
a Hin@@ du @-@ Leader , for example , had no concerns to tell the critics &apos; critics , they shou@@ ldn &apos;t take care of her own affairs . &quot;
this kind of religious convic@@ tions for st@@ resses in this actually un@@ complicated matter , and sometime came to doubt whether the opposition would agree to the bill of the bill .
but at the beginning of 2017 , the bill was decided by the child before - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent , which enth@@ ron@@ ed into the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law .
now only the president of the country must vote and declare the law .
one of the country &apos;s representative one issued on Facebook a status update which Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ agra@@ m has again posted :
Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence R@@ amb@@ har@@ at : the bill against child before was decided in the House of Represent@@ atives , with 35 votes and no one decided .
after having previously decided in the Senate , the draft may now become a law .
the majority of social media users were thr@@ illed because the laws were finally changed to child before .
on the website of the Ministry of Education , Facebook @-@ Member of the Ministry of Education , said :
it has too much time and unnecessary de@@ cks , which has veil@@ ed the core of the thing , but do you know what ? the child before is in Trinidad and Tobago now illegal , and this is almost every prize .
while Abel Jackson &apos;s opinion it was definitely enough to complete the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas convinced that the day was finally arrived :
public status update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which states : , , excellent news !
the event network has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , votes - 35 for it - 0 ! ! ! !
fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( W@@ I@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society group which is quite openly openly discussed , as important the adoption of the law , noted :
the married age in Trinidad and Tobago is now independent of the religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
the draft for the amendment of the Act was made today , on 9 June 2017 .
in the House of Represent@@ atives , there are 41 dep@@ uties and 35 were present at the voting .
all members who were against , voted for the law .
the children in Trinidad and Tobago is no longer allowed in Trinidad and Tobago .
it was a long battle ( ... ) # child@@ r@@ age@@ s@@ ild@@ a .
many thanks to all the activists who put him forth .
con@@ gr@@ ats .
a Dan@@ ke to our M@@ EP@@ s .
however , a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Mah@@ ar@@ aj , the Secretary @-@ General of San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the best known Hin@@ du @-@ Organization of the country .
prior to months , Mah@@ ar@@ aj announced his intention to conduct judicial steps , should en@@ act the law , and he seems to redeem his promise .
during the At@@ tor@@ ney Paris Al ra@@ wi , a supp@@ orter of the law , said it be justified if Mah@@ ar@@ aj would like to make sure most social media users would like to deal with the discussion on the subject .
Patri@@ cia Wor@@ rell struck him :
rather , Sat , if we call , instead of discus@@ sing the discussion as general , in a way that we could speak instead of the problem that we may protect the state in our bedroom , that it may be used by large , hard @-@ hard men who are opposed to them , &quot; would you be ready to continue the discussion ?
or do you believe it is not a problem ?
but if there is no more important step against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however there are still places in the world where the children are legal in different gra@@ d@@ ations , or still the norm although there are laws , which they say .

thanks to the mirror of web pages , Turkish user can look at Wikipedia content .
the English language on Wikipedia page was presented on January 18 , 2012 , in addition to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IPA copyright laws .
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
for more than one month , Turkey f@@ uses the popular and crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based en@@ cyclo@@ pe@@ dia Wikipedia .
day is clear how important the platform for users can be found to share helpful and reliable information .
both students as well as repor@@ ter and fans of TV series are against the blocking .
although many technicians are often used , changing tools for blocking websites ( a current article from New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN preval@@ ence in the world ) , most common Wikipedia users will not fall into this category .
although Turkey has released articles from Wikipedia , as recently as recently published in a published report by Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , you will find regular block@@ ings of the Internet since 2007 after the Internet Act ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after China , Turkey is the second most famous land of the world , if it goes around the massive c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of Wikipedia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the platform remains closed , there are now several Mir@@ ror Pages ( pages which are reflected the contents of Wikipedia and frequently updated ) .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform laid down all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centr@@ alized pe@@ er @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network ( i.e. computer calcul@@ ator ) , which makes it a complete c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the content is activated despite the prohibition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a report , IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
after we have heard the messages ( over the Wikipedia ) , we were able to put out snap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform , so the possibility to read the contents on de@@ centr@@ alized and distributed ways .
this can help users to see at least all Wikipedia content , even if they can &apos;t achieve the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pe@@ y.@@ org .
IP@@ FS also provided that this step is independent of the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it was merely a screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wik@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to handle the sperm cells .

S@@ ascha Gir@@ i was with the photos that he looked around , never satisfied . they were bl@@ ended with po@@ or@@ ly positioned moti@@ ves and balanced colors .
that motiv@@ ated him to wear a camera with themselves and try to gra@@ b the situation .
he was still a child .
today , at the age of 28 , S@@ USS is trying to bring Nep@@ als , Nep@@ als wildlife to the international stage .
and its hom@@ etown right next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , it offers the perfect opportunity to shoot photos , which guides the attention on Nept@@ une &apos;s wildlife .
in Facebook , he described this first class on Facebook as it helps to help him :
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could it better give for a passionate game of wildlife ! !
I felt right at home when I suddenly called Navar@@ aj ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) . he had a call of my father , that it would be a le@@ op@@ ard on the bank of the Rap@@ ti river .
the river dam@@ m is only a few minutes away from the tourist village Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I went on with my camera and was there in few minutes .
my father observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river , where the Leopard was side and I immediately started to kne@@ eling pictures ! !
S@@ ascha aims to obtain a collaboration with the authorities to obtain worldwide recognition for Nep@@ als nature and would like to understand the understanding that the animals are not as fur@@ ious , as they look like .
and he should know it ; because he arose from face to face to face , saying ,

sleeping time for all animals and birds .
also , because of darkness , on the way back home , when suddenly the king of the bush appeared immediately . it immediately sets us , we see and star@@ red me through the Sal @-@ trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals , S@@ USS placed the logo &quot; I click for Conservation ( lit . : I clicked for Environmental Protection ) on his Photos .
but its passion for the promotion of Nep@@ als nature and game is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days , and lived there mostly in a tent to take in the Bar@@ dia National Park recordings of Ot@@ ters . up to 12 days , until he could photograph a tiger and live six to seven days for perfect photo of birds , which live near the tourist accommodation .

this post was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and originally appeared on video Vol@@ unte@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organization from India .
a revised version was re @-@ released as part of a Content Shar@@ ing Convention .
in many parts of India there are women with greatest care , names of their hus@@ bands or even by older men in the family .
instead , they use a Pr@@ onom@@ ic or saying &quot; father of my child . &quot;
from Ch@@ u@@ is@@ gar@@ h to Mah@@ ar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h give women to respect them because of the social pressure of the husband , as well as fear of the consequences , they should viol@@ ate the norm in order to live this practice .
last year Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was condemned by a pseud@@ o @-@ chamber by the Indian state and ch@@ ased out of her family and the community , after having called a married relatives with names .
the tradition of tradition did not call their wives , as well as among men , however , they have far more adher@@ ents to fear , if at all , they should not follow this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mah@@ ar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health staff as well as household stuff , a unique club , and were thus fast to the main focus of the city .
it is only one place only for them only to discuss and discuss the host@@ ile of the Patri@@ arch@@ al .
as one of 56 clubs , which is in 13 Indian states , it is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ bad@@ al , which is operated by the community Video Vol@@ unte@@ ers .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ el@@ works has been working with the help of their video camera for the discovery of practitioners , such as children &apos;s marriage to the association of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS @-@ In@@ depend@@ ents , and manages that club .
it reports about it , as these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time they have made at the amb@@ ass@@ adors of the change .
the first video , the Roh@@ ini showed in its discussion round , tra@@ ded women in their hus@@ bands did not call their hus@@ bands .
it has op@@ ted for this topic , because they wanted to open the conversation about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem with which the women can identify themselves .
to address the names of their hus@@ bands , there is a bro@@ ader , which they have pleaded not guilty to all duties and have never been question@@ ed .
Roh@@ ini said :
this tradition testified that a woman respec@@ ts her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not keep this , is considered a v@@ ist , as woman without Mor@@ al .
tradition is so deeply ro@@ oted that we have never made us up to this discussion round .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini wanted to try her husband , so far as previously called in the name , try out at home , as it runs .
they showed the video of the discussion round about her husband and mother @-@ in @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini told :
my mother in law and my husband still weigh long after the video was at the end .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pra@@ k@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I should call it from now on his name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roh@@ ini started her first discussion with this self @-@ confidence in the Bag@@ gage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; some believed that it was a good thing , because it meant the younger members of a family , especially girls and women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of the round Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video@@ projection , the women tried to bring discussion with an exercise in motion .
Roh@@ ini asked any participant in the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , off@@ ended , sad , loving and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then she asked all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If we cannot tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but to call us as they can , that they may not respect us ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
should it not be equal ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years , and this was the first day when she brought the name of her hus@@ bands on the lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ br@@ ash in Mah@@ ar@@ ash@@ tra over the Bre@@ chen of a Year of centuries , in which women married the names of their hus@@ bands ever .
Roh@@ ini told :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a woman was so sh@@ y that she was just outside the whole exercise ; a different one decided to escape the whole fru@@ str@@ ation against him and his family , taking him cursed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
expression in their faces was ec@@ static .
I think it will never forget it again .
still in the A@@ dr@@ en@@ al@@ in@@ fr@@ enz@@ y , with an ancient bridge broke , the women decided that they could really try to call her hus@@ bands in the name .
and they kept their word .
in the next few days Roh@@ ini received a number of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini , and asked what ideas she sat in the head : his wife could not stop his name .
another club member decided to do it with dinner before the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law stri@@ pped , she was afraid , saying that there was a mistake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini said , I should do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a husband of a participant was less under@@ stand@@ able and the situation was art@@ ed in violence .
Roh@@ ini reports , such as women tried to stop other practices such as carrying the zin@@ no@@ red points on the fore@@ head that shows the Eh@@ est@@ status :
why must only women show that they are married ?
I said to my husband that I would bear the zin@@ no@@ red point when he would like it .
he laugh@@ ed only and I list@@ ened to him to carry him .
the other women did not hear completely , but they think that they are now in a better position , even to choose him in some days .
for many women , the discussion sk@@ e@@ b is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals .
&quot; we are doing an excursion on every discussion .
normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to take care of women who could hear what &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
during the last months , they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes , and they d@@ anced and spoke about things about which they had never made thought before .
Roh@@ ini said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have been working on these problems for so many years , such as our ident@@ ities are linked to our hus@@ bands , never as hon@@ est . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it feel great to say that certain things can tell you , no matter how small it occurs .
in discussion round , we have under@@ ne@@ ath the concept of honor and it is connected to clothing .
some women in the group have only been borne by Sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most of them is okay , but some wanted to bear a Sal@@ ma @-@ Kur@@ ta , a wide shirt above a p@@ ants ; they did not clo@@ the .
after much argument and discussion about the advantages of your own h@@ anger , the Mor@@ al connected with the Sar@@ is and much more , tast@@ ed cru@@ ini their own pairs of Kur@@ t@@ as ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) into a discussion round , so that women could bear them .
next , they now have decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a , where they can wear Je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is sure that they will be able to create it .
at the question , whether in the five months since their first discussion has been somewhat changed , Roh@@ ini confirms that things slowly come into the rolls :
we have made only small steps .
some women tried it a few times , but then heard again to say the name of her husband .
some of them included , do it still , but only if they are alone and no other family members are present .
just one or two would continue to say the names of her hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now wear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red at their fore@@ head .
the women in discussion will know that the changes that they want to achieve in their lives - as the line for more movement or their own hang@@ ers - at the end of a difficult to navigate river .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; having confidence in mut@@ ually confidence , will be aware of them in the same boat . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how Roh@@ ini explains :
every one of us is a sacrifice of patri@@ arch@@ al .
I am so too .
but this club shows all of us the confidence that change something .
and I know that it will not only be limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction , if any woman deals in the club in the club and other people , what we speak and what we do .
we all sit in the same boat .

a new system of kidn@@ apped people for the organs , probably for super@@ st@@ itious purposes , was troubled by Z@@ amb@@ Ã©@@ zia , a province of Mozambique . the local government has called a number of operations into the life to stop the intern@@ ships .
at the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometers from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims was de@@ capit@@ ated and a part of the organs were collected .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another group , the target of assassin@@ ations for ob@@ sc@@ ure purposes is people with Al@@ bin@@ ism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this led to the fact that the UN in 2016 led a mission in the South African country to investigate these practices .
the persecution of people with Al@@ bin@@ ism is usual in other countries of Southern Africa , especially in the neighbouring country of Tanzania , where the government had developed campaigns to combat this aber@@ ration and pre@@ judi@@ ces .

a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , which probably had been made only recently .
this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partner agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of imprisoned Chinese dis@@ sidents Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has drawn attention in the international community , after his lawyer was announced at the end of June that he had been hosp@@ ital@@ ized due to liver cancer in the final stage .
in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( Prosecutor ) , after being involved in the design of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o which the democratic reforms in China had been involved .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred the case as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an internal matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a speaker told it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , China will continue to release the calls from the international community , the Nobel prize lau@@ re@@ ates and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , which allow him to allow a treatment abroad .
while some countries critic@@ ised the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are completely wi@@ ped out to the topic .
Hong Kong Free Press has collected some responses from abroad .
United Nations United Nations
en@@ vy R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , High Commissioner of the United Nations for Human Rights , met at the end of June Chinese officials to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a speaker , however , rejected whether the United Nations should enable pressure to allow Li@@ u to allow treatment abroad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Norway and Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ Ã¸r@@ ge Br@@ ende have refused to answer questions about Li@@ us &apos;s release .
it was the relationship between China and Norway , after the Nobel Peace Prize in Li@@ u was awarded to Li@@ u , although the Norwegian government announced that this was nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations were resumed only in December last year . in June Norway , Norway signed an agreement to re@@ build the sal@@ mon in China , since the exports have been largely blo@@ cked since 2010 .
after the news had been spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee brought his hope to an un@@ conditional release , and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo .
due to his imprisonment , he was not able to accept his rate .
during the ceremony , Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a decision in which China was called to liber@@ ate Li@@ u and his wife immediately from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support where he wants .
the top management of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , China also called to release Li@@ us as she accepted in an explanation on 30 June :
we simultaneously expect China to raise all restrictions by Mr. Li@@ us wife and family members .
they must meet all visits and receive , who wish them , and may be able to communicate free with the outside world .
USA possible on USA
&quot; &quot; &quot; U.S. Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said that Americans wish him &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said that he has the possibility to treat in abroad , in this respect to his satisfaction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
another speaker of the US Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the news agency AFP on June 27th , that the message sent the Chinese authorities to release not just Li@@ u , but also his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia will free from her house arrest .
the assessment of US embassy moved to China , with the utter@@ ance of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that &quot; there is no country the right to agree to an eman@@ cip@@ ation and ir@@ responsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley told that China should offer the couple of the following :
protection and freedom such as travel documents and access to the medical care of its choice , which they have been awarded according to Chinese Constitution and legal systems as well as international obligations .
the U.S. Sen@@ ators Marco Rub@@ io , Jeff Merk@@ ley and Ted Cruz have introduced a decision in the Congress to penet@@ rate the Chinese government to penet@@ rate Li@@ u and his wife un@@ conditi@@ onally release .
I challenge China to confirm the Nobel prize lau@@ re@@ ate # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o un@@ conditi@@ onally to allow himself into a proper medical treatment . h@@ tt@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
from Germany to Germany
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German government spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin hope that Li@@ u will get all the medical support he needed &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Chinese president X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping was released on July 7 and 8 at the G20 summit in Hamburg .
previously , diplomatic sources reported in Beijing , Reuters , that China had great concerns if the ver@@ te@@ bel could over@@ fill Li@@ u the visit to Hamburg .
Canada and Canada
on 28 June , the Canadian ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um China demanded an appropriate medical care for the purpose and to give it the possibility to give it to him from his family .
Li@@ us advoc@@ ate AFP previously told that Li@@ us woman , Li@@ u X@@ ia could visit him every day , but the police always monitored the room in the hospital and that Li@@ u is not permitted to speak with someone outside , including his lawyers , and contact us .
Mc@@ Call@@ um tells you :
Canada calls for China to adopt its international human rights obligations including freedom of opinion , including freedom of opinion , and to restore the rights of this rights .
France and France
from 29 June to the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs , China asked to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all treatments , which he , regardless where , is needed . furthermore , his wife and his family may have to contact him .
although the news channel information reported that the French government would be called Li@@ u in the country , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was announced that no further information will be found if France may finally receive him .
Taiwan
the Council of Fest@@ land@@ lords in Taiwan ur@@ ged China on 27 June to release Li@@ u , and take a larger tolerance to those who require peace reform to reform political reforms and democratic development .
in Taiwan , the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legisl@@ ator Yu Me@@ i @-@ nu has also asked to deal with China to treat the intellectual property of Li@@ u in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual guide in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , showed himself very wor@@ ried in an explanation on June 28 at Li@@ u and gave that many have asked him to pray for Li@@ us well @-@ being .
he said about Li@@ u :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is my belief that he took and had been strictly charged for which he had been strictly charged to a harmon@@ ious , stable and we@@ al@@ thy China , which again would have contributed to a peaceful world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I felt very much , and encouraged me when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellec@@ tu@@ als and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , the Charter 08 signed , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or Country ?
Singapore . Singapore .
license : CC@@ 0 Domaine Public
is Singapore a city or a country ?
the question may be du@@ mm , since Singapore is recognized as an independent state as an independent state .
but according to the minister of Justice , K. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am should be considered city as a city .
this re@@ mark triggered a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the association of the State of New York , the Minister noted that many people had critic@@ ised the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore as compared to Singapore with other countries .
it under@@ stands that Singapore should be considered as a city .
... no one has asked if New York is a democracy ...
this is , most people going to go an error .
I tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Blog Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io accused the judicial affairs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; turn to logic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to defend the existing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; authorised exercise of power in Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then , according to all our efforts and offerings to create this valuable country , we will say that we finally are no country .
it was so vul@@ gar , it had the calls of a escape before the responsibilities , a breach of obligations .
Singapore , if you &apos;re not my country , whose land is it ?
the reasons mentioned by Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am were not a Nobel : he def@@ ended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in view of what , it appeared un@@ constitutional .
in contrast , he def@@ ends the idea that Singapore should be compared to Chicago , San Francisco or New York cities , equally the cities that are led permanently by a party .
these cities are democratic .
once you reach the core point of the theme , the good old Lei@@ er of the authorized providers of sei@@ z@@ ure are going to be democratic logic , because they are better fit in their power .
in the final effect the answers were given in the last week by Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am to his American guests with our press , our J@@ udi@@ ci@@ ative , of our political system really non @-@ responses .
corresponding questions tar@@ ed with non @-@ respon@@ sive manner .
Rachel Z@@ eng requires Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am to illustr@@ ate his opinion , because they did not understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
if Singapore is not a country , but a city that is to which country belongs to our city ...
in short , I do not understand .
I would be very than@@ k@@ ful when our new K Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am would take the trouble to clari@@ fy this point , if he was high , to be part of the government of the City of Singapore .
by clicking on the blog he published his comment on the reviews that you should begin to read the entire address of the Conference , in order to understand the context of the statements of Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am , according to that Singapore is a city and there is no country .
please read the address .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore was rather a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said why the elections in Singapore would be un@@ likely to consider ourselves if we are free and righteous elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he contrac@@ tu@@ ally Singapore with cities in the United States ( and how many of these cities saw a party in decades ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said , Singapore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be no country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he obviously didn &apos;t mean it in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cl@@ ement T@@ an shows its dis@@ appointment about Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am , who makes the leader of a growing generation that makes such a pol@@ em@@ ic statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am over what the Minister of Justice of Singapore has said , &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least I knew Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old Gar@@ de , which expects me to agree with them or not , but this is a different thing .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am , member of the new generation of the political leader of Singapore , I doubt and I &apos;m not even sure whether he is really associated , and aware of what he def@@ ended .
the Tem@@ as@@ ek Review remov@@ es the vulner@@ abilities of Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ ams arguments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have committed a mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or was it a man spokes@@ man ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Singapore is not a country , we &apos;ll only be considered independent and so@@ vereign state ?
if not , on which country go the so@@ vereign rights of the city of Singapore ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally country and city .
since he plays an important role within the government &apos;s pur@@ ification , the statements of Mr. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am are of serious importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why do the Lon@@ av@@ enger bring their military service , defend it only their city but not their country ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who must pay our Prime Minister invo@@ ices ?
what is the value of our pink staff ?
are we citizens of a country or inhabitants of a city ?
if the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade was added to the Be@@ ef , Singapore and always a city :
&quot; I did not say what I said ... &quot;
this proposition seems to have a lot of Singap@@ ore@@ an ...
no one has ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we &apos;ve always been a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear people like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defence of the country above all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but that &apos;s not quite right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we shou@@ ldn &apos;t speak of the defense of the city .

Global Vo@@ ices asked short of his editors : what is the most failed aspect regarding your residence or home country ?
their answers are published here as part of a ongoing series , showing the rum@@ or over certain parts of the world and will be shown to another fac@@ et .
the newest part of this series comes from Nev@@ to Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the question that is most asked me in Japan is , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are you an American ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am coming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m coming from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 1994 I live and again in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on the situation in which situation is taking place , it is considered pol@@ ite to show interest in his talk partner by making personal questions .
for my clari@@ fication then the standard answer is then : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice @-@ ho@@ ckey , nature . &quot; many Canadi@@ ans may cook about rage , but if they are kept for Americans , but anno@@ ys me .
for someone who doesn &apos;t know , there is a little one distingu@@ ishes us Canadian of Americans .
this is one of the reasons why many Canadi@@ ans have a Canadian flag clearly visible at their back@@ pack if they travel .
all love Canadian .
American signed by contrast ... .
so it was already when I began 20 years ago to travel through the world - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 .
in the meantime , Canadi@@ ans have already carried away small A@@ hor@@ n@@ blades to their baggage , to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free healthcare !
with us there is no weapons !
equ@@ iv@@ able marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
all seem to think , Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we obviously say very often &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exc@@ use . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada is also considered to be the most toler@@ ant country opposite ethnic groups .
we are not like this types south of the limit .
we are Canadian .
I hate it .
first , I got a lot of American friends which I ad@@ mi@@ red a lot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would not account for me if you would shift me with Johnny Lake Highlands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or by Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there are some problems with the stamp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; first : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said to be careful , but trag@@ ically important figure N@@ ed Flanders &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Simp@@ son &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( who has a Canadian double h@@ unter ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Canada really had a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flanders , that would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem exists that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality .
there are no edges and edges , nothing can be seen at that time .
harm@@ less , means in@@ consp@@ ic@@ uous and not interesting to earn .
this may be something good , if you want to finish un@@ noticed in the background , away from the things that happen to be around .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would even go to the extent that the desire to be free and alone , a main leadership of the Canadian . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what external &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; is perhaps simply cool courtesy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canadi@@ ans are not talking about the fence with the neighbours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we lack the sin@@ c@@ ere , open friendliness that I have connected to my American friends . &quot; &quot; &quot;
fortunately to us ( and for the rest of the world ) , Just@@ in Tru@@ de@@ au entered the stage in order to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice &quot; . our prime minister Canada made it sexy .
music video of a pop @-@ band par@@ odi@@ ert Tha@@ il@@ ar Jun@@ ta
one of the famous pop @-@ band , published in Thailand , published the j@@ unta , who took power in 2014 and re@@ produce the civilian government despite res@@ ili@@ ating the civilian government .
the new song &quot; dict@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ w@@ girl ) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells it that his friend makes his gir@@ l@@ friend .
although not explicitly polit@@ ically , the music video refers to the lasting military coup of the Jun@@ ta .
the band was comm@@ ended by many fans and other Internet users to describe the country &apos;s situation .
the video for song was a huge success .
within the first three days alone the video was shared on Facebook 1.@@ 254 times and received 8,@@ 800 Li@@ kes .
last month , the Charlie Chap@@ lin @-@ Video &quot; dict@@ ator &quot; was blo@@ cked in Thailand after a group of activists re@@ locate the public .
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entert@@ aining introduction to Thai politics as dealing with the situation in the country under the Jun@@ ta rule .
check out these photos from the video which rel@@ ate to some of the political topics related to Thailand in the past three years .
the &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ical section 44 of the provisional constitution , which has given absolute preced@@ ence over important national issues .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 11th rule : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change your attitude &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the not@@ ori@@ ous program of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ordination &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people who can be viewed by the Jun@@ ta as a critic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the picture above reflects the introduction of the law concerning computer crime against , whose v@@ age and un@@ clear rules are often used by the authorities to termin@@ ate activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit was established in the army , the online content is monitored and individuals , which is accused of having prosec@@ uted the mon@@ archy , criminal prosec@@ uted .
Thailand uses a Stri@@ ped Shel@@ ter against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ est &quot; ( Maj@@ esty King up ) .
on 20 May 2014 , the mar@@ tial law was proclaimed in Thailand .
two days later there came to a p@@ utsch of the army .
one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to buy their decision @-@ expensive U @-@ boats , although safety did they war@@ med that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax name .
in the video will even be shown , how people can be thrown into a black v@@ ans before they bring them into an intern@@ ment camp , further problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some journalists are sitting in prison , because they have supp@@ os@@ edly causes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confusion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in society and Internet users &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; long pen@@ alties , they ought to off@@ end the mon@@ archy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the song of the songs of the band , inspired by Sal@@ ut , &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em , &quot; which was already used by p@@ utsch @-@ opponents during protests in 2014 .

the post @-@ war partnership re@@ covers slowly into East @-@ Ab@@ ch@@ asia , mainly in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has passed over 20 years since the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; org@@ isch @-@ ab@@ as@@ ian war has been officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still visible in this part of the republic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking pictures .
villages like D@@ zh@@ an@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ k@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ l@@ ava are in the carbohydr@@ ate basin of Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
various ethnic groups such as Rus@@ sians , Greeks , am@@ as@@ ies , Geor@@ ger and Armen@@ ians lived and worked to Soviet times in the area .
many of them had to leave their houses during the war .
today , the largest part of Rus@@ sians and Ab@@ ch@@ ases are living in the area .
such sett@@ lers are also called things in Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
in the pre @-@ war period there were still more than 10,000 people , today there are only a few hundred people present in these cl@@ ergy effects .
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 the population of the area in 16,000 people had barely increased after a decade .
in 1989 about 43@@ ,000 people lived in this district .

&quot; this is a consequence of the war &quot;
the empty five @-@ storey blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s , called Ch@@ ru@@ sch@@ t@@ k@@ ow@@ kas are symbolic for the decline and the devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are fall and rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ zh@@ an@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native older man .
he starts a conversation and it &apos;s hard to end this .
&quot; this is a consequence of the war . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is still unique . &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
there were congregation centres , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens , served all of the community .
now there is only paved road with infl@@ amed spl@@ end@@ or @-@ buildings .
the people who once lived on this place and made their contribution to the central planning industry of the Soviet Union , have now abandoned the district .
in the gh@@ ost town of D@@ zh@@ an@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , about fifty inhabitants live .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a in the other villages are similar .
the Ch@@ ru@@ sch@@ t@@ ow@@ kas , which is still one or two families , recognizes in the balconies where laundry is dried up .
two young girls , both of seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when they detect me with the camera in the hand , they immediately drag themselves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our mother forbidden us to photograph us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it simply has forbidden to us , that &apos;s everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her gir@@ l@@ friend and suddenly leave the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area are working for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al@@ ug@@ ol .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence farming ( cultivation of farming products for their own demand ) such as livestock hus@@ band@@ ry , be@@ eke@@ eping and vegetables .
it &apos;s difficult to come about the laps .
the District Administration provides candles and bread for the villages in the winter .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build cour@@ get@@ tes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
about ten years ago , an older woman named Gal@@ ina ( or a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a , as she is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite their oldest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina has not left Ab@@ ch@@ asia to live with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my heart is always told &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ab@@ ch@@ asia &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gal@@ ina wants to receive any financial assistance from her daughter and wait for their young grand@@ son instead .
Gal@@ inas monthly r@@ ens are just nine dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden or a house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a tells you that they and other vill@@ agers try to celebrate and celebrate their holidays regularly .

&quot; a 90 year old woman and a young family and I live in this building .
if holidays are , we visit us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but we cannot do this constantly - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while she tells its story , a younger neigh@@ bor will appear on the balcony .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nat@@ asha , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; calling a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said , we could build zu@@ cchini . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have prepared the ground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build zu@@ cchini . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; one can get to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ as convers@@ ation@@ alist Nat@@ ascha together with her husband and her five common children lived in her house for some time .
Nat@@ asha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day she is remin@@ is@@ cent of the village .
despite the relatives who live in Central rus@@ sia , Oss@@ et@@ ia and Georgia ( the Land of Ab@@ ch@@ asia simply broke away ) , they didn &apos;t have the opportunity to leave it .

&quot; we recently bought a country in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administration capital in Ab@@ ch@@ asia ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build an house there , but it will take some time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained it again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ ascha is awarded for approximately $ 9 child &apos;s money for each child .
her husband works in the Kohl@@ eng@@ ru@@ be .
the young family has its own farm .
near the house where in the kinder@@ garten , they kept pigs , cows , H@@ aly@@ ne and chick@@ ens .
it tells you that it was first a fri@@ gh@@ tening situation , when many people left the village after the war .
but in time , they lost their dist@@ resses .

&quot; we have no fear in front of the dark street or the few people .
one can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
in fact , it &apos;s really something to do with lo@@ ot@@ ings .
after the war there were hardly any labour and all lived like it was right .
I remember every day , as the city and the war were once . &quot;
when our talk becomes the end , a little boy passed over to us .
it runs through the windows of a destroyed building and hidden .
a ball flies from the window and another boy promised him back .
he plays with the ball , then roll down the hill .
a group of children are now persecuted the ball .
while they run , some of them put stones into the falling building .
these ruins are part of their childhood which make un@@ certainty in their lives .
they do not know differently .

&quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mig@@ rant on their long journey
Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez is head to a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border of Mexico in Guatemala .

this article by Amy Bra@@ cken was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our Partners PR@@ I.@@ org . it is published here with friendly permission .
on the way of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , located at the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
it is directed by a 59@@ - year @-@ old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink Br@@ ill@@ en@@ frame and golden sl@@ ings in ted@@ dy b@@ ill@@ ets .
she is called Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . however , they know many under the name Mama Africa .
this nickn@@ ame is the fact that the hotel ( or rather she itself ) has become a goal for Afri@@ cans and Ha@@ iti@@ ans , who are on the passage .
the hotel has no charm .
for about $ 2.50 per night the guests sleep in simple rooms , with grinding , crum@@ bled walls and beds made of metal .
in the entrance room there is a par@@ r@@ ots in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - nevertheless , hundreds of African and ha@@ iti@@ an migrants are here .
sometimes , Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez told the people in full little bus@@ ses and from the upper part of the coast to call : &quot; Mama Africa !
where are you my mother of Africa ? &quot;
at the moment it is rather quiet but in this year Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have also slept outside on cardboard .
she wants to be re@@ ject .
she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick , they bu@@ ys them medicines that they can &apos;t pay , she mass@@ aging them with a bal@@ m that sm@@ elled from the long journey .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived in front of a short time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I asked him if Mama is a reasonable first name for Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Sebasti@@ ao family ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who owned a gh@@ gh@@ ty sta@@ che ) pos@@ ing with Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : Amy Bra@@ cken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel that it suits you because African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very lov@@ ingly .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very well here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister , who hopes to go to Boston to find her husband and her three children .
they already lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans , who are on the way into the United States , normally one of the first stop in South America and then move towards the north .
the family owned by other composers from Mama Africa . &quot; m@@ um Africa is a well @-@ known name on the route , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti .
he tells us that Ha@@ iti@@ ans and Afri@@ kaner would often travel together the track and that Afri@@ kaner would speak to W@@ hat@@ s@@ App from Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
as many of its sign@@ atories , Michel@@ et previously lived in Brazil and worked as a construction worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy was weaker , he started his journey into the United States .
he &apos;s been a guest of Mama Africa since months : it sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ ju@@ ana .
I ask him if he will have in contact with Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is our Mother , and we never let them go again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He answers sm@@ iling and remain in touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez told that her guests have often send text@@ books if they have gone to meet them or to report about the course of their journey .
it explains that their Christian faith is the pro@@ pul@@ sion of its work .
they don &apos;t know much about Africa but their guests have taught you , chicken like in Ghana .
Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez is perhaps well @-@ known here , but it is not the only wireless hope for migrants who travel through tap@@ est@@ ula .
the other end of the city leads a blind alley to Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
in this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family was included in their small house .
he is polic@@ eman and has found that the bus tickets are sold to numerous African migrants .
he began to help them to get a reasonable price , then he gave them his house for one dollar the night .
at the moment 25 people are there , mainly Ha@@ iti@@ ans .
some sleeping on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests do .
&quot; I have lived in the United States , &quot; he says . &quot; I experienced what they experience .
I crossed the border via the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others not help . that is the reason why I give them my support . &quot;
after he lived for three years , he was transferred to a raid on his workplace in the United States .
the majority of migrants who travels across Tap@@ ach@@ ula , comes from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their houses for them .
JosÃ© Antonio Cord@@ ova Mel@@ Ã©n@@ dez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children , who wanted to press from him money , without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for an accommodation and an unknown , single @-@ handed , has offered her roof .
a few months later , the family lives and try to decide where the next steps should go .
back in the house of Mama Africa is all again full of guests .
in the hall@@ ways , the traveler calm their phones .
a mini@@ bus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , a majority of Somalia .
Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez seems happy about that her house is full , but she is also nost@@ algia , because of those who have gone away .
like a proud grand@@ mother , she bl@@ ends her in her album with many photos .
there is one of their daughter with African hair stain@@ ed which you made a customer , some photos of their grand@@ children and many trav@@ ellers more , boy and elderly .
she laugh@@ ed , while she briefly presented her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ya Bro@@ ch@@ eron &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; repeated every time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they &apos;ve been gone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang inhabitants are forced to install on their cell phone app .
a check @-@ point for personal communication equipment in X@@ inj@@ ang on Twitter user is the UK &apos;s .
the residents of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic min@@ orities region in the west of China , are comp@@ elled to install a Spyware on your mobile phones .
on 10 July , the mobile phone users received a mobile phone notification in the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an district of Ur@@ um@@ qi , in which it exhibits the District Government to install an monitoring app named J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web @-@ cleaning &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the announcement , it is said that the app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will make access to terrorist information &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but k@@ Ã²@@ s the authorities also use the app for more than that com@@ b@@ ating terrorism .
according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ fecture , because they had already installed the app , messages received with a private 3 chat group .
in the notification of the police , the app changes the sources and the distribution paths of the terror@@ ists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information , &quot; including videos , images , e@@ books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ w@@ angs website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elecom .
the main function is the blocking por@@ no@@ graphic websites , from online gu@@ ile , tro@@ upe and Ph@@ ishing pages to make users atten@@ tive to users , how much time they spend online , and remote control of your own home network .
this app with filters for min@@ ors is to help the children to develop healthy lifestyle .
an app with these features can be used in various ways .
for example , the &quot; remote &quot; state &quot; state &quot; or even h@@ acker , could manip@@ ulating the home network of any person or steal out of it .
this introduction is consistent with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
while messages about digital c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in China are mostly concentrated on the experiences of users in the major cities of the East and south , reality is very often dim for those who live in remote , oppressed ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in conflict areas , authorities are often arrange extreme c@@ ens@@ ors and monitoring measures , as well as rout@@ in@@ ely internet switching .
the media @-@ based media Out@@ let &quot; Images from &quot; China &quot; ( Gen@@ uine quality ) , the cen@@ sored news in China , showed photos from a Check@@ point when polic@@ emen had the inhabitants random@@ ly damaged , whether they had installed the monitoring app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian ensure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification demanded that people install the app within 10 days .
if you find at a Check@@ point using a device without these software , it could be imprisoned for up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they forced people to use devices that are intended for elderly people .
this is a form of captivity by law @-@ awak@@ ening technology .
we are back again in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from the Republic of China &quot; ( Act of the Act ) also released a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang @-@ product description from which the software can lift up the pass@@ words of a Windows operating system , so that the software has to receive unlimited access to the computer &apos;s hard drive .
after installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang computer and mobile phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang are electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , there may be a reaction to the instructions of the city council , to minim@@ ize the dissem@@ ination of illegal content .
all government branches , authorities and associated facilities , including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office when running their computer and communication equipment .
a current report by Freedom House , an US @-@ American human rights organisation , also mentioned these new monitoring methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang published the authorities on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi , published its &quot; personal ID cards , phones , external drives , portable drives , not@@ eb@@ ooks , and media memory cards . &quot;
the intention is to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist videos &quot; and destroy these action however , however , the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants , and gives pen@@ alties for a whole series of other potential price , including those who refer to peaceful religious or political messages .
sleep or death , Part 1 : all scre@@ ams after death
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .
photo of : Cor@@ rie Bar@@ cli@@ more ( CC B@@ Y 2.0 ) .
this is the first of six reports in series &quot; sleep or death , &quot; in which the activity is Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane and his experiences in a Syrian prison .
far away from our blue , virtual world you look at and stell@@ ations that you are entirely in a place where everything is important .
everything has gone and dis@@ band@@ ed after it and dis@@ closed an truth that is clearly recogni@@ z@@ able , both from inside and outside .
one that makes all honour for her name .
one that is reflected in a list of feelings and squ@@ e@@ eze down , allow no met@@ aph@@ or to allow .
but when you bring the reality again and you look behind the scenes , the beautiful scenes and the actors - trans@@ forming the characters into beings of flesh and blood , and all of them cri@@ es after death .
all the doub@@ ts , in smoke , and you will become aware of your existence , even if the earth is moving along the axis of the accident . you will be clear that you are caught here between the walls of your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone built around stone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they arrested me and ar@@ ro@@ red three times , but this was not enough to create &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my lesson , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the chief of the safety of safety are formulated with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he introduced his power over us , making it even the sim@@ pl@@ est concepts that we knew .
five young people were torn out during a peaceful protein , such as the dar@@ nel from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
it was enough to cut off the city the darkness of the night with &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; -@@ Schrei@@ er .
all neighbour@@ hoods were cov@@ eted , only my own not .
for the first time it was still , ra@@ is@@ eless , in the wrong time , even if I set out no high demands on a city that is to defend the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their compli@@ ments .
in the third night , things had a bit cal@@ ming after the power supply list@@ ened to the quarter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I broke out the silence by moving several times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from my house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I heard my voice in silence .
a few minutes later , some of my friends felt enough to gather together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends joined me , we were al@@ lied with a splendid image that satis@@ fying my expectations full and completely fulfilled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in such a moment , you will be aware that you fre@@ eing the Spirit from the lamp , but it is just not able to do you in the Low &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make you ready , we meet us at the military service building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he laid up .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you would swal@@ low up - nothing can return to your voice , after you have carved it all the way to the office of security service from the body .
I arrived there .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I now also .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an starts to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Let me listen to me as you cry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or you are just crying out enough , if we are not nearby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
its hot water filled eyes fell to me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you are sad , what I can look to me in the eyes , not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and what I did so did nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood before this building .
perhaps it was fol@@ ly , vanity ; perhaps at the revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was so certain when I answered : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think I never heard , look to you in the eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
it was the shortest entertainment to have such fat@@ ally consequences for me , and I don &apos;t regre@@ t any word from what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is in individual and his father equal with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; his father equally with it . &quot;
the gre@@ y@@ ank of this det@@ est proposition is to me up to now in the nose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he became one &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; syndrome , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a se@@ cular torture , which I was exposed to months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I scre@@ am the yard .
in the first office I leave everything I can carry with myself .
after that , through the court and into the second office , which leads through one speed to the individual cells .
I prepared my details exactly before I cared for the room .
otherwise , in this time they would probably be allocated a larger cell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to share it with only one more det@@ ain@@ ees , and may immediately set me without permission to wait for their permission . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes , who felt like a whole life , the civil servants left the cell , and I grab@@ bed on an old proven communication method : with f@@ ist against the wall .
I learned that my cell phone was a &quot; nar@@ row@@ ful &quot; . &quot;
after a long ignition he answered me finally .
apparently , no one of the surrounding cells was a well @-@ respected male , middle @-@ aged people , which looks like me and called &quot; Doctor &quot; Doctor . &quot;
in the perfect darkness we can recognize no markings facial features , and doctors there is not here ; we are all numbers .
&quot; perhaps someone , whose voice is like my sounds ? &quot;
all answers are connected to its existence .
maybe he was re@@ located in one of the large cells .
perhaps he will stop immediately .
the investig@@ ator had assured me , they would stay free if I abide .
li@@ ars .
I would like to have a bird @-@ birds in order to distribute all these cro@@ ws , which lab@@ elled in the fruit in the garden of my head lab@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the distance , I don &apos;t listen to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ fic &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must be approximately 10 o &apos;clock in the evening , always around this time the scre@@ ams , every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black the colour of the sl@@ ump , until I saw the yellow light , which asked us the grave in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; Donn@@ er , &quot; announ@@ cing on 13th customs of Kor@@ an ) .
&quot; they are here to hear . &quot;
this was the secret p@@ aired : to protect the state security before us and prevent the terror@@ ists and the terror@@ ists in the al@@ a@@ funny dial@@ ect . so they played their conc@@ ession map from and ver@@ ted the close eye @-@ view of its global view .
this is not a house where there is no land ; it is a curse to trans@@ verse it in order to trans@@ form the crime of their sounds into a her@@ oes .
I ad@@ mi@@ red the hearing , and meet at Abu I@@ mad , a sl@@ ender and sto@@ cky man ; at least he comes so before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he starts a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleasant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conversation , despite the expres@@ sions that escape the gle@@ aming , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my boy , you &apos;re still young , you can join and protest against demonstrations that can be found shortly an end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not answer .
I acc@@ ust@@ ed it to me , not to answer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really can &apos;t say more precisely when ins@@ ults and pun@@ ches after a friendly talk to me in ordinary communication . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when and how that happened , was un@@ important .
some voice in me said that I had to be punished me , even though I had done nothing to deser@@ ve this sentence .
to be punishment in all its variety .
his command is to rip so much flesh as possible from the body .
he calls the lov@@ ingly &quot; conf@@ ession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic pipe , which probably comes from the clo@@ ak .
your hen rejo@@ ic@@ eth to your cry .
give him the pleasure , you can &apos;t measure you and you can &apos;t re@@ stop your terr@@ ors .
my cry were not enough , so they are not enough , so they inter@@ changeable it through a cable .
during my first arrest I asked if the investig@@ ator had worked earlier times as a gar@@ bage collection or until it belonged to normal working equipment .
they had four cables attached to each other in order to present us from their view@@ point , great invention of a huge cable .
three of them in one hour , three of them , while I was still in the series .
I had lost all feeling in my body - and also my voice , why I list@@ ened to cry .
the hen noticed the cooling down and didn &apos;t feel like a pleasure , so it is why it is neighbour to an electrically loaded staff .
electricity flow@@ ed my whole body enough to supply my whole area .
my semi @-@ cra@@ cker body , which was stretched out on the ground was the perfect current conductor .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had filled his duty for this night .
it must have been at midnight .
I decided to sleep back again ; let &apos;s say , that was my only option .
some hours have been for@@ cing , who arrived as minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
the door opens and the morning light meets the space &quot; .@@ R@@ out with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fic@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am answering the voice of an exhau@@ sted young people : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my lord , my father must make fear@@ ful concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be still , and you &apos;ll be moved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they had always released me .
where do they lead me ? !
the Jord@@ anian R@@ apper Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b talks about the rights of the L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q + community , free expression and resistance
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
this photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b leaves the majority of its time in the town , and he slim to his screen , again to his computer , and again to his couch .
why can you leave , there is a cigarette between his fingers or with nicotine un@@ defiled lips .
he lives in the chief corn@@ oss of his family house which had been one of them since 1967 ; and in which Israel had forced his occupation of the West Bank and H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs family had forced to escape from their village in Palestine ( about : farmer ) .
for six years , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b is an passionate active activ@@ ist , the conservative majority are transferred to gender roles , sexu@@ ality and free expression over gender roles , sexu@@ ality and free expression by art and rap@@ ing .
with his music , which deals with topics such as Oriental , rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian skir@@ m@@ oth , but also calls for the core of the entire Arab world . all these topics will not only be found in cities , which from Damascus in Syria until the whole of San@@ aa in Syria .
with his 25 years , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees itself as a man whose thinking is not restricted by limits , and he can feel the devastating consequences of foreign intervention in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if he doesn &apos;t open it , he stim@@ ulates the US &apos;s foreign policy an extraordinary b@@ aff@@ ection .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b is considered his art in Amman in his studio .
recorded by the author .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b believes not that his compassion for those who try to survive in war@@ fare , anything with its identity as &quot; Palestinian leader of the second generation , &quot; says himself , even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine so far .
&quot; I don &apos;t think because of my own life , &quot; emphas@@ ises h@@ d@@ ai@@ b .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am a man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while he poured out the nest of Nes@@ adan in two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan . in this time it is intended for Muslims to fast@@ en the sunrise until sun@@ down . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal .
apparently H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee at a sen@@ su@@ al hot fri@@ days have little to do with protest against Islam .
basically the pieces of warm coffee and the cock@@ les of the K@@ ent cigarette in the nose into first line of freedom .
sometimes , Jordan feels like a prison under the free sky , especially when you raises a look into the neighbouring countries .
therefore it avo@@ ids simple to do basic things - as in the public during Ram@@ adan to drink water - to land not in prison .
recently , the Ministry of the Ministry of Jordan adopted a show in the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a , already for the second time .
some parliamentary committee that support the Islamic Emirate - argu@@ ed that the sexual orientation of the Muslim Brotherhood - Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no , contra@@ dic@@ ted the cultural and traditional nor@@ ms of the country and is the main reason for the concert .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the members and former spokes@@ man of the Islamic Coalition DI@@ MA Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CNN , that the concert &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had been cancelled due to sexual orientation of the singer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many claim to claim the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab spring , human rights and free expression in the Arab world , is the dangerous acti@@ vis@@ m that authorized the ancient of legitim@@ acy of author@@ itarian reg@@ imes in the entire region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a came to the j@@ ord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supp@@ orters of human rights , &quot; which continued to continue to use an intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement is probably not just a sil@@ ky rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic , but actually an evident up@@ heav@@ al reality in Jordan is clearly reflected in H@@ d@@ ai@@ b work .
in the year 2016 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b traditional Gender nor@@ ms struck by his vision of the fate of Arabic women that con@@ vo@@ ke sex .
the picture shows the sk@@ el@@ eton of a obviously ador@@ ned woman , whose arms and legs appear to the corners of the screen .
she is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of in@@ numer@@ able women who have lost their lives by the hands of those who actually should trust .
in the past few years , the number of &apos; honorary mor@@ dium &apos; has increased - the un@@ official outside was left .
according to Human Rights Watch , the number of Hon@@ or in 2016 reached its zen@@ ith ; however the institutional infrastructure is still lack to support women who attempted to attempted murder or domestic violence against an appropriate way .
according to a law on the overthrow of death in 1954 , women who have been exposed to in@@ defin@@ ite high @-@ family treasures , &quot; and for their release is often a year &apos;s bureau@@ cr@@ atic expenditure as well as the guarantee of the family that the woman will happen nothing .
also H@@ d@@ ai@@ b music enjoys great popularity and is known to rep@@ ay them not as tab@@ ulated in his country for a long time .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b asser@@ t that his work is polit@@ ically , but he dre@@ amed that he &apos;s his music , the full of exp@@ editions to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression of expression , cannot be separated from politics .
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man .
he became a policy of politics , &quot; he says .
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b takes the question after the Palestinian identity .
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; will focus on poverty .
the list of songs which are polit@@ ically active in the heart .
in March 2016 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b published a song with the title &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song , a verse is often repeated :
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is it . &quot;
in another course of the songs , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b describes the world as a type market , in which one can get in his words , &quot; what you want &quot; - is faith or non @-@ belief , hetero@@ gen@@ e@@ ity or homosexu@@ ality .
he noticed that no one speaks in Jordan on the rights of gay men and les@@ bi@@ ans , and that comments on the gender equality of L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q + individuals were still cen@@ sored in 2014 .
in 2014 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b conducted an interview for the popular j@@ ord@@ anian On@@ line@@ program Ro@@ ya , to note later that his comments were torn from context , and in his opinion was cen@@ sored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Youtube , it was uploaded without cuts , but was only a revised version , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b advert@@ ises the Arab L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that int@@ ol@@ er@@ ance against homosexu@@ ality does not dis@@ agree to Islam .
he mentioned Abu Nu@@ vo , a poet of the eighth century , which still has remained in memory thanks to its hom@@ o@@ erotic poems .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b asks : if Abu Nu@@ vo , who should work on behalf of the cali@@ bre , in the eighth century openly could write about homosexu@@ ality , why should Jord@@ anian do not know ?
the real problem , so H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , have nothing with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a or the fact that the concert was cancelled , to do .
in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ian kingdom there is nothing new that the government attacks attacks on freedom of opinion and that progressive voices are led to silence .
recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian news service took several former government members and members of the lec@@ tur@@ ban on the grounds that they had expressed their problems with the deeply in the land root corruption .
in view of what &apos;s the show in H@@ d@@ ai@@ b opinion , only the tip of the ice@@ berg - the real challenge is to be a structural change in the next generation of the Jordan .
for him , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a has now turned into a concert for the second time , but the way of progress - it looks well , deliber@@ ate and in@@ significant changes . it is sure that these changes will take place from day to day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society .
in the last century , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , like millions of other Arab@@ s , was also abroad of an Arab world without inter@@ ventions .
he will not only dreams of it , his work to Bagh@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to experience it . &quot;
perhaps , the region will help the help of music , art , literature and literature , and not through bombs , stre@@ et@@ un@@ itions and on artificial sort of guided demo@@ cra@@ cies . at least , he hopes it .
so far as far as far as far , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b will continue to resist and also resist resistance .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the three biggest festivals in Japan .
this big , ex@@ travag@@ ant war@@ d@@ olls are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous the@@ ories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festivals .
it is thought that there is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festivals , which is usually considered in August in many opponents , the drums , and the tan@@ dem lasted more than one thousand years , to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the Em@@ ishi in the knees .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to catch some great seats , therefore we have a great view .
one can hardly imagine hard , how large these parts are ...
a joint centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organised a two @-@ month exhibition at W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( lit@@ t@@ l ) .
I have been watching the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two pa@@ ws are straight to see .
nevertheless , for many people who take away the journey to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only landmark - and a breathtaking way to spend his summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and I watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the view of a 18 meter high car was incredible .
let us enjoy the rest of the summer !

rarely , outer apparition and body care were as important as in this story , because they help to maintain the Peru@@ vian youth from the crime and to promote a legitim@@ ate profession as the course of the hair@@ dres@@ ser .
El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historical center of Lima , a region with a very high crime rate , where street children and illegal drugs are daily .
a survey , published in April 2017 , showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region do not feel safe .
at the same time , Peru experiences Peru - how many other Central and South American countries - a rising demand for men for men .
the trend , the appearance and therefore also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous sports athletes like Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , gave himself more normal citizens into the experienced hands of hair@@ dressing , which can produce these elabor@@ ate hair@@ styles .
an unprecedented demand for hair@@ dos , which go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition of hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 .
there are experts from each other to show , who can see from them the ec@@ centric le@@ ooks , as you can see in the following Video ( other videos on current competition there are on public Facebook @-@ profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as School August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , located in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to ex@@ changing young people , to exchange their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools , which allows you to find work in the hair@@ dres@@ ser of art , which allows them to find work .
motiv@@ ated by this activity and some possibilities , dozens of young people saw that they can take a job , currently in fashion .
the school offered special apprentices@@ hip workshops in the beginning of March and reported about some of their successes :
in 1995 we were the only specialist school in the municipality and the district , which we are very proud because of love to the children we have built this educational community .
Colombia : love letters to gu@@ err@@ illa fighters

&quot; &quot; &quot; the following article is the revised version of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Liebes@@ verbot on Guer@@ illa fighters &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; published the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contribution is published here within a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we write little letters to people who we know ?
is it not much more import@@ antly , people who feel well @-@ made ?
exactly this question was the two young colleague of Leonardo P@@ Ã¡@@ r@@ ra@@ ga von der Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ art and Crist@@ ian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the head and inspired them to the campaign cart@@ as p@@ or la Re@@ conc@@ ili@@ aci@@ Ã³n ( letters for reconciliation ) , the young people ex@@ h@@ ort , gu@@ err@@ illa fighters .
only recently , her country was called for a historical event , and they wanted to contribute to their part : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had closed a peace treaty with the gu@@ err@@ illa movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary forces of Colombia ) , which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
International applied the sign@@ atories of the peace agreement as an important that the Colom@@ bian President JosÃ© Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for its mer@@ its services .
but before the column , however , there is still a long way until one can speak of a real conc@@ iliation and peace .
Gu@@ err@@ illa strug@@ gles , who lived for many years in illeg@@ itim@@ ate camps , were subjected to a prisoner of war crimes and contributed around the clock their weapons with themselves , to integrate them into life as civilians .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Colom@@ bian company again strug@@ gling to life in perpet@@ ual fear and in some cases were used to absor@@ b gu@@ err@@ illa fighters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they must support this in its rows and support them in creating a new life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Leonardo and Crist@@ ian we convinced that young Columbus could join together and help the integration process .
and exactly what did they do : until now , thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former gu@@ err@@ illa fighters to welcome them again in the company .
the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former gu@@ err@@ illa fighting - which then should be handed over to personally .
the Valentine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the Camp@@ a@@ ign
the idea for reconciliation was created on the World Summit of the Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates that took place in Bog@@ ot@@ Ã¡ in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Crist@@ ian had the opportunity to speak shortly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ y@@ arth@@ i , who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this declared that we love to write on the day of thousands of love letters , but those that need them much more necessary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he reads , he told his love to share his love with people who needed the most ur@@ gent show . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , the plan was made to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the dis@@ course of a war history to a common history of peace , &quot; they say .
until now , more than 2000 letters were collected during the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ Ã­n , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ Ã¡ .
&apos;@@ I never would have thought that someone might forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over on March 19 in one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ end@@ o Cau@@ ca region .
a group of 40 students from the University of J@@ aver@@ iana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ art traveled into the camp to get the letters personally .
the members of the F@@ ARC shown so , as they had done it earlier to accept the commands of their leader .
but this time they did not receive orders , but letters full of sub@@ subject from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for all involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings one can run in just a few hours - from anxi@@ ety to luck and everything that is between &quot; says the political science student Manuela Jim@@ Ã©@@ nez Av@@ ila later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the governor of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca described this unforgettable experience as follows :
after we had handed over the letters , a former fighters led me by the camp of gu@@ err@@ illa fighters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when I saw in one of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cam@@ Book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( a kind of cottage , where the gu@@ err@@ illa fighting live ) , I saw a gu@@ err@@ illa fighting who wrote something . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was afraid to enter , because in addition to him on bed the M@@ GL @-@ Granat@@ werfer , a deadly weapon in the village of th@@ orn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ello , what do they just do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am answering a letter which someone has written to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
never before me in my life has something so nice , I am thinking about it . and suddenly I left the tears over the che@@ eks .
I embra@@ ced him , and set me beside the pom@@ egran@@ ates .
perhaps he was sorry for the war , I was sorry for all the years of lo@@ yal efforts of this fighting , and would help him to write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he never had something different from life as war . he had never thought to preserve him and his six brothers before the hunger strike . &quot; I would never thought that someone would forgive me for my mist@@ akes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but now I know that there is a company without an open poor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
until now I have learned , how I have to deal with weapons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but now where peace reig@@ ns , I can learn many things and do in dig@@ nity &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new voices
students and some leader of the F@@ ARC joined a discussion round .
they were all grew up as early as war and the F@@ ARC already revealed in secret .
therefore , the leader of the F@@ ARC declared the history of the organization , their ide@@ als and gave insight into their views over the peace process . &quot; for many years , we experienced the opportunity to develop us to a political party , we can help us to design the society in this country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a target of these orders , it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manuela was impressed :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these people have never found hearing , and had no elec@@ toral right yet , and to know that people who had often been seen as a monster , and they even turned around with beautiful emot@@ ions , which were surrounded by their lives and environment , was very pain@@ ful for me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reality , where the land lives , does my hurt to me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it comfort me that all men - even those who have killed and so much harm has done to give us something , and a smile and a hu@@ g can give us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many former fighters have answered the letters .
Gust@@ av@@ o Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o Cau@@ ca , wrote for instance Dar@@ Ã­o de Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , Archbishop of the city of Cal@@ i , following letter :
the column was made , that after de@@ fo@@ rest@@ ation peace would reign peace .
but this is not true .
as long as it is in@@ equality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment possibilities , there will always be people who are ready to hold to arms , and to protest to their rights . and that &apos;s also entirely justified ( ... ) .
we now rely on the F@@ ARC now in peace , on a policy without weapons .
that is why we call all the def@@ enders of peace - no matter what breed , religion or ide@@ ology - to rise over all those who dream of a country in war .
we give you our word , aff@@ ord our contribution and offer sacrifice , because we know from my own experience , that nothing is simple . those among us who defend the life as the basis of existence , many difficulties are im@@ min@@ ent .
on our way , there will be many obstacles , but we will overcome them together .

homosexu@@ als and qu@@ e@@ ere people who live in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a large range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and compres@@ sive .
with terror , activists have experienced the reporting of the last months of persecution of the persecution of Che@@ chn@@ ya in Che@@ chn@@ ya .
but the threat that depends on the local L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q community . it is not only emerged overnight .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gro@@ z@@ ny , which has dealt with us and spoke with us what has happened in the republic .
the L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q legal situation in Che@@ chn@@ ya has conquered the international head@@ lines after several months after it reports , killing torture and killing of men in the Republic of them@@ atic areas .
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in Now@@ aja gas , she cast lots of light on methods of Che@@ chen authorities , who fortified the susp@@ ects men and plug@@ ged in secret pris@@ ons in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; you brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a wife , was born in Gro@@ z@@ ny and grew up there .
since her childhood , she felt that she was a woman in reality .
when she was grown up , you became aware that Che@@ chn@@ ya was not a safe place for them , so they moved to Moscow .
after a group of Che@@ chens who had experienced their country soldiers , the hunt was opened on Sab@@ rina .
in fear of her life , she moved the last end to the US .
Sab@@ rina : I was active as a volunteer hel@@ per in a human rights organization .
one day was told me that someone needed my help .
it was a friend from Da@@ gest@@ an , a woman who put in trouble .
she had no money , so I took her without delay .
while I tried to help her , someone made a copy of my documents , and spread it anywhere in the Internet , with my telephone number and a picture of me . &quot; then there is no men to eliminate any more in Che@@ chn@@ ya that can eliminate these confusion ? &quot;
then , the photos of my documents made by the whole W@@ hat@@ s@@ App round .
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
when I was doing so , a few exhibits from the re@@ seat of my cars I heard a male voice saying , &quot; Here is a gift for you from your un@@ cle . &quot;
when I turned back , I felt anything in my body , but I did anything hurt to me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard a set , but this time on the che@@ ek : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long wilt thou return the family again , you b@@ lot ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I didn &apos;t recognize the person .
I know only that there was a young man , no 30 years old .
then I lost consciousness and awak@@ ened last end in the hospital .
apparently , some women got together to scre@@ am and scre@@ am to scre@@ am .
the man was fled .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital , I learned that I had two notes in my right pul@@ mon@@ ary pul@@ mon@@ ary .
OC Media : in which medical wings were laid - in whom men or women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are ob@@ sol@@ ete , there is still my male name , but the doctor said , and put me to women .
I am very than@@ k@@ ful for this .
when I read his name for the first time at his office , I got it to do with fear ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ cas@@ ian name .
but he turned out as good man .
I am grat@@ eful to him that he is respec@@ t@@ ful with me .
I spent more than one month in hospital .
last February , I got thre@@ ats .
they cried to me , wrote me : relatives , strangers , some completely unknown .
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was attended by neigh@@ bors and some distant relatives .
the requested , sending me back to Che@@ chn@@ ya , in order to prove that everything was a lie .
they reported ab@@ sur@@ d claims : some said , I am proved to prove it by the streets ; others wanted that I had not changed my sex in the official TV in Gro@@ z@@ ny , that I was not changed my sex , and Photoshop .
I have grain size C - what would I have to say in television ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this print ?
Sab@@ rina : it is still hard for them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some older people spoke once to my mother on the street . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You brought a monster to the world , not just your family , but the entire republic is disappointed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot stir you , because you are a pi@@ ous wife , but you must disappear from here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my mother was too much and she got a Stri@@ ck around the neck .
fortunately , the neighbours came and delivered them .
at the time , I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved into an apartment and a few hours later , a car stood with dar@@ kened windows , and a number plate with a number of 95 .
after the third time everything was happening , I was clear that there was something wrong .
my human rights of human rights referred to the number@@ ing signs - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how are you fled ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons , I want to give up their names , but I want to say that I remember them all , and they really helped me .
with her help I left the country , but then happened something incredible .
I cannot realize how it could be .
shortly before my departure from Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to call my mother when I arrived .
I bought it without registration , without any identification , without anything .
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the rub@@ b@@ ish .
arrived and checked in the hotel .
the number was registered to a stranger .
I set the SIM card to my mobile phone .
at the moment when I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ app , I got a message : &quot; you believe not approximately , you were in security , only because you have left the country ?
our people already know what hotel you need . you even know your room number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; just to prove you : it is the number 115 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
can you imagine this ? !
that was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in touch with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
however , we don &apos;t talk about gender equality , however , this is a table topic .
I can still bear some traditional Cau@@ cas@@ ian elements still in me .
so very I would like to be able to overcome this se@@ es@@ ian barrier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say always that my mother is in life , I will do my best to viol@@ ate them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when we act with camera , I really give me to look like the person who reminds us out of their past - so to my male form .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know something about the current location in Che@@ chn@@ ya ?
what do your friends do , those who have stayed ?
Sab@@ rina : I submitted last week a report in Washington .
for this I needed current information about the situation in Che@@ chn@@ ya .
I spoke to someone who gave a half months into Ar@@ gun .
he told that Ram@@ adan were not arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait to wait , and he won &apos;t have a new wave .
most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives .
so , my I , they probably invite their relatives , to take care of the problem with the person concerned and at the end a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; glory &quot; was experienced by blood gen@@ ug@@ g@@ doing .
OC Media : is now also weak@@ ened men in these secret places now ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine , it would not be very much .
if , especially those who have not enough , have dropped out of their relatives or have dropped to Kad@@ y@@ rows court .
as far as I know , they will be held there , so they can present it as terror@@ ists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should they be slain , they will show their bodies in television and asser@@ ted them , they could have attacked any village or military base . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you understand ?
as if these people not simply disappeared , but targeted specifically to radi@@ alize themselves .
OC Media : is it now just a mut@@ ation or have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I &apos;m just someone who was imprisoned in a half months in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says that many people have disappeared at this prison , after having gone c@@ art . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was nothing new of them since .
they simply have taken them .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was , when these people were taken away .
however , until now , they were not presented as band@@ its , in addition there was no reports . we noted that such actions are quite possible .
why else could I not allow this people to sh@@ ave fast ?
do you know if this tra@@ ce@@ ability and demonstrations of people who were called &quot; non @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation , were already mentioned in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I still wore my hair for ever .
in Che@@ chn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think , already in 2003 I was already known throughout Gro@@ z@@ ny when I lived there - and I never had problems .
in Ernst !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when the Sh@@ aria was considered , I had never had problems .
on the contrary , it was much saf@@ er than now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia was originally willing to bring us to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; civilian &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but ultimately decided in the stone time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how is it possible with the S@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were sm@@ ashed ; I had coloured eyelashes , brought tube je@@ ans and short foot@@ steps .
the safety of the Sh@@ aria has never stopped me only a hair .
before the Russian theatre in Gro@@ z@@ ny , there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , a whole group of people like me met .
it was a small place where several banks rose , and all the city knew that they knew why men , young people met there .
we have never been off@@ ended .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a Rede@@ mption : K@@ har@@ da K@@ har@@ da . that means : &quot; sp@@ o@@ ct not over the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
it is often said to children , when they make sure that they are fun with sick .
OC Media : so they simply have their eyes closed down before you , because they believed , they were sick ?
Sab@@ rina : Yes .
they never ins@@ ul@@ ted me , never j@@ agt and never struck .
OC Media : how long kept this Gn@@ ad@@ ens@@ ation ?
Sab@@ rina : so long , until Kad@@ y@@ row came to the plan .
when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began to talk about Mor@@ al in television .
he spoke not about us by se , but above the behaviour of women .
nevertheless - one could feel like people in the city began to change .
he who ra@@ ced and lo@@ aned in advance , looking at a time with suspic@@ ion .
in the days I left Che@@ chn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home , I could feel like the situation in the republic steadily intensi@@ fied .
OC Media : what activity do you start now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I do not earn much - $ 700 to $ 800 per month are not much in the US .
apart from that , I am still active as activists .
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I have communic@@ ating with them as a psych@@ ologist .
we organize tea ffs , gath@@ er@@ ings , I att@@ ing them to hospital and help them to get food cards .
I have no cents for this .
I discovered this human beings , when I pl@@ ung@@ ed a curse .
I am Muslims and I would like to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ den@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : this is al@@ ert .
so it is nature , that has nothing to do with religion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is exactly the same as the Che@@ chens who desire to give you with foam in front of the mouth that there is no ow@@ ls with them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Da@@ gest@@ ans who have Cab@@ ard@@ iner who have the Rus@@ sians have also ; on the planet they are - but they are not in Che@@ chn@@ ya . &quot;
I &apos;m from there , that &apos;s why it is un@@ pleasant , sh@@ y , sh@@ it .
I meet here so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practi@@ cing Muslims who go to the mosque and fast@@ ing during Ram@@ adan - live together with men .
you know , many think of transp@@ osition of men who love men , and they believe that you changes his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a tru@@ ce .
that are two different things - two different types of sens@@ ation to be exact , different life settings .
for me it is the most important thing to feel me in my own skin and will not be ashamed for my body .
not if I have a partner or not .
I &apos;m sorry that I &apos;ll be so personally about , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago .
and I &apos;m not sad about that - I know that I am now myself .
local groups war@@ ns an increase of sel@@ mor@@ den within the pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suff@@ ers from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
since the last few months , there is a strong increase of sel@@ f@@ mor@@ den .
the photo of Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the suicide of a man named J@@ assi@@ mil@@ i Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27th , the des@@ per@@ ate situation of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran , co@@ ined from poverty and unemployment , the spot@@ light . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child . he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the An@@ wa@@ z region in the south west of Iran .
he suffered from anxi@@ ety , depression , and he sto@@ op@@ ted for his own help to asc@@ end his family , Ah@@ mad i human rights groups that work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and want to remain anonymous .
a video held on YouTube with the moments after having had already ign@@ ited itself .
some people made fast to er@@ ase the fl@@ ames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ eg@@ h@@ ani hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources , bur@@ ns were so strong that the doctors couldn &apos;t do any more .
he died short time later .
it was not the only suicide that has happened in August within the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i minority , and activists appear before the spot that even more men could take life .
the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Centre for Human Rights asked that this month some other - Ham@@ id Manifest@@ at , Ali Haz@@ b@@ awi , Ali Haz@@ b@@ awi , Ali Haz@@ b@@ awi , Say@@ yed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sh@@ ah@@ ab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im .
their stories have a thing in common : there were all family @-@ fathers , who were based on persecution by the Iranian government , hel@@ pl@@ ess and imm@@ or@@ able to keep their families to live and secure their work .
Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region , which is based on the majority of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran , was sh@@ aken by a pro@@ found economic crisis which makes it difficult to contest her living in the domestic Arab population .
before a century , the Arab be@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly independent region in Iran , until the P@@ ahl@@ avi @-@ mon@@ archy took power and took over in 1925 great efforts to finish ethnic autonomy in the whole Iran .
in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the biggest in Iran &apos;s largest oil and gas fields as well as some of the richest and most valuable areas for the Iranian agriculture .
despite these precious resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the native population gets a little bit of this wealth .
it is often victims of un@@ treated diseases , hunger and emp@@ t@@ ying .
the Iranian regime is ref@@ using the ancestors of the ancestors of the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries .
the government has also built a variety of dem@@ men , the water of the Arabic territories into the Persian areas where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and Gh@@ om are re@@ direct .
these manifest@@ ations have led me to destroy those in the region by dr@@ y@@ ness , devast@@ ation , local farming as well as the fish and palm @-@ industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ ha@@ w@@ zi @-@ adolescents now increased to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian General Director of cooperation , work and social welfare , noted that 5 % of the ancest@@ or who had a work completed primary school , 55 % have completed a secondary school and 45 % have completed a university degree .
a &quot; systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance &quot;
Kar@@ im spar@@ i , a Iranian Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i human rights activ@@ ist with residence in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; to a &quot; high rise in the number of self @-@ mor@@ den under the young Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i men .
Ken@@ i Ken@@ i said that particularly the unemployment remains worse than worse . reason for this , a combination of a high number of Ah@@ wa@@ z went to ethnic Per@@ sians and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the con@@ stell@@ ations process :
since officials and institutions are not preferred for the Arab labour , the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i will res@@ ume access to work opportunities in all sectors .
that is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arab@@ s and for@@ cing them to earn their lives outside their country Ah@@ wa@@ z .
there are people who had to change their benefits and sur@@ names , in order to hide their citizenship to the ancest@@ or , since the Arab names are not toler@@ ated , because speaking the Arab language , or the Tra@@ gen Arab clothes .
given the circumstances given by the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i , human rights activ@@ ist alarm , before the situation explo@@ ded .
it remains to wait if the world aw@@ akes and takes it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treated and hom@@ icide , avoid@@ able .

&quot; why don &apos;t I identify with the femin@@ ism , also with the inter@@ sec@@ tional &quot;
detail of a photos . taken by Pix@@ ab@@ ay . published under the CC@@ 0 Creative Commons License .
the following article is a revised version of the statement that was published by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on the site Af@@ ro@@ f@@ Ã©@@ min@@ as . the article was subject of several discussions in which many different positions came to expression .
they can be read in the comments under the original text .
if I say that I &apos;m not a femin@@ ist , react many women - especially the white women who can design@@ ate themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ aries of femin@@ ists - with fru@@ str@@ ation .
you wonder why I am not part of movement .
she even thought good and well thought scientific and social arguments against me why I should be a femin@@ ist and why we generally should all femin@@ ist * .
for example , women today still earn less money for men in spite of equal education .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that women still are still under strict observation , if it comes to work with their bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
or that cultural and social standards are still ensuring that women so@@ jour@@ n or later in various areas of life to a gl@@ ac@@ ne ceiling , and that discrimination based on gender is still across many different countries and belie@@ fs .
all this is aware and known .
I am convinced of it and I suffer twice and triple them .
I am a black woman .
and yet , if I speak on skin colour , on black c@@ is women , on black women in the L@@ GB@@ TI@@ Q church or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I mention , on which kind of femin@@ ist movement , many white femin@@ ists and white inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists were to be silent .
however , they all agree that women - all women - together should come together to sing &quot; their voices , to sing &quot; K@@ umb@@ aya , my lord &quot; to sing the equality ( some ) of women .
but they don &apos;t want to speak to sexual violence a institution@@ alised form of assi@@ mil@@ ated violence , which are exposed to black women on two times .
or in that , black women and women are less deser@@ ving as white men and women .
that black girls and girls with a migration background to the school are respected as white girls , due to apparent integration problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or that women in black sp@@ ans and women with migration background to a higher risk have been subjected to domestic violence and violence in the partnership as white women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , I wish that all men , all men , and all human beings have either a movement , in whose center the white woman stands , who refused to take account of un@@ mist@@ akes in their thinking which refer to both gender as well as the skin colour of a person .
I &apos;m exhau@@ sted and become no more about my citizenship in a white @-@ femin@@ ist orient@@ ated sphere , killing me and in@@ numer@@ able other black women always and again rejected .
in 1851 , So@@ il filed a speech in 1851 , saying , &quot; Am I not a wife ? &quot; and I also refused to maintain a ide@@ ology in which the black woman has a significant and mar@@ g@@ inal nature .
I ref@@ res@@ h me to join me group@@ ings , which also assi@@ mil@@ ate through cultural enrich@@ ment of our customs and customs to drive its eg@@ o@@ centric program .
I will no longer try to grow white women the importance of the over@@ thro@@ at of skin colour and sex almost . some of them will continue their significance in black women for femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women try to revi@@ ve them .
although inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ial Femin@@ ism was founded to give women &apos;s home to a home and turn from the white femin@@ ism , still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in its name .
I take it to dissolve my full and whole of femin@@ ism , which was called for my dark skin and my status as wife , rather than for a white femin@@ ist par@@ a@@ dig@@ m , that is very persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon .
now , it is more important than ever before we define our own ideas towards us and we will help us to give us to our own ideas that we will be created for us .
Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the Book Afri@@ cana re@@ gen@@ ism ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : how we can defend ourselves to defend our own kind , in which they can defend ourselves in this way into which the cultural , spiritual , se@@ cular , physical and even the spiritual elements can be encouraged .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ate femin@@ ists immediately refer to separ@@ at@@ ism and exclusion after they have read these lines , please inform yourself about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contra@@ dictions of femin@@ ist movement , of which the black woman is affected .

Pad@@ del@@ ights against pollution : the mission of a man that protect rivers in Iraq for future generations
this post by To@@ dd Reu@@ b@@ old was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine published in particular on international efforts to resol@@ ve environmental problems .
as part of a Content Shar@@ ing Agreement , this article will be published here again .
again , Nab@@ il Mus@@ a traveled in the last 7 years - usually with sur@@ f@@ board or in Kan@@ u - with a special request by the Kurdistan region in Iraq . its mission is aimed to deliber@@ ate the importance of clean waters for current and future generations .
in this documentation of Emil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a , who explains its relationship with the rivers of the region and the effect of pollution in its municipality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really wanted to do something for the river we had lost when I was still a child , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mus@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists from all the country fear that the decades of war , construction of dam , pollution and un@@ controlled development , will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organization of Water@@ keeper Alliance - which works to protect themselves and protect the rivers , streams and water paths in Iraq , as well as local communities in sustainable use of this natural resources . &quot;
at the end of the video , Mus@@ a summar@@ izes the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we had no water , how would we survive ? &quot;
this video was produced on En@@ sia by Emil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , a documentary film@@ maker and multi@@ medi@@ al journalist , produced , filmed and published in Er@@ bil .
the focus of their work is followed , little considerable sub@@ cultures and character@@ ised by the use of co @-@ operational video photography and a new multi@@ medi@@ al techniques that can tell their stories in their ways .
Paraguay : women and their difficult fight against violence
&quot; &quot; &quot; one group women , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The crying women &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to express their pain on women &apos;s mor@@ atorium in the country and in the region to show her re@@ jection . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is the ab@@ brevi@@ ated and modified version of Article &quot; The Wave of Viol@@ ence against Women in Paraguay &quot; from Kur@@ tur@@ ally . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( the residence ) of the number of violence against women in Paraguay .
most of the names were changed to the protection of persons affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a police Commissioner said A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said they can do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her partner who had become non @-@ violent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the end of her relationship had been some time and the police said , their statement would be put to the files , but more could not do .
when a further woman showed Bal@@ bu@@ ena due to mist@@ re@@ at , the accurate display of A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez was also useful .
a few days later , the second wife moved back their ad back .
to break the famine in violence against women , is difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if women have taken an ad at all , in general , no support on the part of the State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in many cases , women have also been fin@@ anci@@ ally dependent of the men that they abuse . this also explains why only 20 % of women receiving ad@@ mit to be victims of violence to be in the prosecution authorities .
content and Statist@@ ical Treatment 2 In@@ visible Mis@@ sions and a Legal system that is nothing unter@@ stand @-@ 3 of the laws : good approach , faul@@ ty implementation and statistics
it is hard to determine how many women really are har@@ assed , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez , a social scientific research facility in Paraguay . &quot; there are different information and reports , but not once infl@@ ate the extent of the gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; explained her .
the numbers available are al@@ ar@@ ming .
in 2015 , the At@@ tor@@ ney Office of 9@@ 600 repor@@ ters went to domestic violence because of domestic violence . at 70 % of it went to violence against women .
86 % of ads in the police came from women .
there were more than 5000 ads due to domestic violence among the pe@@ ac@@ ies . 86 % of the ads arrived here .
in the ads , 40 % of women reported that they were physi@@ cally har@@ assed , 55 % of women responded by psychological abuse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these statistics show however not the real extent of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen Kaiser Ana Bai@@ ard@@ i , only few of this off@@ ences will actually be displayed in Paraguay due to psychological abuse , 9 women , which do not do this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on every woman , which will be reim@@ bur@@ sed due to physical abuse , two women who do not do this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated at the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since women &apos;s murder in Paraguay is no own off@@ ences , the prosecution authorities cannot be appropriate to document how many women are murdered by their current or former partners .
by August 2016 there were at least 12 cases of women in the country .
the coordinator for human rights in Paraguay were at least 37 cases in which women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to its estimates , all ten days of women die a woman because of violence through men .

invisible abuse and a legal system that nothing under@@ takes
before Mariana Br@@ Ã­@@ te@@ z was the fixed friend of Carlos Vera , he in@@ si@@ sted that they called his name to all of their former friends .
at the beginning they didn &apos;t want that , however , but after . this was supposed to repent .
today , Mariana is 28 years old and not more with Carlos together . but for two years she brought the psych@@ ic violence against women - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most severe recogni@@ z@@ able :
I have never thought that I would have been victims of mist@@ re@@ at .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I have read before , I thought that the only women happens to under@@ go , because they would fail from violent men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was convinced that this would never happen .
Mariana uses social media to report about the abuse of Carlos Vera .
without name , she wrote contributions on Facebook in which they described his ins@@ ults and various attacks during their two @-@ year relationship , and told how he had isolated it .
many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rh@@ et@@ or@@ ally if he ever rose up his hand against them and refused to conce@@ de that his behaviour was also a form of abuse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other Facebook users said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why they had fallen so long from Carlos and left him not earlier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it seemed almost as they wanted to say that victims of mist@@ re@@ at least would have a certain participation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Victoria Santos , which dates not from Paraguay , fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner she har@@ assed them .
Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o te C@@ RE@@ O network ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) that consists of women who are all in any way victims of mist@@ re@@ at@@ ment .
in group they can talk to others about their experiences to listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many other do not do : they sei@@ ze the statements of women .
in Vic@@ tor@@ ias case everything began with psychological abuse .
her we@@ al@@ thy partner managed to convince her even to convince her , that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat them .
Vic@@ tor@@ ias displays with the authorities remained without result and also from their relatives , she received no support .
it led a trial against its former partner who developed to become an un@@ interrupted judicial battle between Paraguay and its home country , mainly by money , power and influence of their former partner .
Paraguay Language : good approach , faul@@ ty implementation
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws , which are very good , but not applied .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the display of abuse is a way full of resistance and a fight against corruption in justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Victoria Santos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen E@@ ch@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN Organization for Women in Paraguay , sees great problems with the application of the laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 , a bill of bill was discussed at the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen Parliament , under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ El@@ las ( # FÃ¼r@@ y ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the Movement # Ni@@ un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # non @-@ Less ) are part of a campaign on Twitter that is supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original design of the law looks before , Fem@@ izi@@ d to explain and har@@ der pen@@ alties as already in neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia is the case .
so , the legislative text in some points changed , in order to obtain the dep@@ uties for the law , so that the way for the criminal off@@ ization of abor@@ tions might be prohibited in principle and sentenced to five years imprisonment .
the original bill had planned to charge the majority of ( bureau@@ cr@@ atic and economic ) processing , which have to carry out the victims of violence , if they are just to restore and secure a safe accommodation to deposit the state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ ch@@ au@@ ri argu@@ ed that the Law is not effective if the legisl@@ ator has no adequate financial means for this purpose : &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Paraguay , mist@@ re@@ at was seen as part of human relationships .
this must take place , so that violence is no longer regarded as a little Nor@@ ene .
those who keep silence in view of this facts will be guilty and contributes to that the perpet@@ rators of perpet@@ rators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must reim@@ bur@@ se this long display until mist@@ re@@ ate is no more than normal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 10 November 2016 , the Law of the par@@ ag@@ ay@@ ischen Senate was adopted , however , parts of the law was altered . however , there was a passage yesterday , who called the partners in cases of domestic violence for reconciliation .
the opinions on the changes go apart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; section concerning the Re@@ conc@@ iliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor , deb@@ ug@@ ged his victims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the string of words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; political force &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of parts of the law applies as a big penalty . &quot; &quot; &quot;

independent media in Oman a year after prohibition of a newspaper continued to attack attacks
&quot; this website was closed due to a resolution of the Minister of Information , &quot; the Az@@ am@@ n &apos;s homepage was published on the homepage of the Al@@ am@@ n Zeitung .
more than one year ago , the om@@ ic authorities have closed the independent Arab newspaper Az@@ am@@ n due to their reporting on corruption in the Sult@@ ant .
You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues to be in prison , where he was a prison sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , Ibrahim Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , and Zah@@ ir Al @-@ Ab@@ ri , were also arrested and returned to court but later came back .
Oman has been ruled by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us ib@@ n S@@ aid since 1970 , who came to power after he had lost his father , S@@ aid ib@@ n Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a state of jurisdiction .
since then , he suff@@ ers from his role as the only Sultan , the most important offices in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces , Finance , Foreign Affairs , Chairman of the Supreme Council for the planning and president of the Central Bank .
the Sultan &apos;s rule is characterized by the har@@ assing efforts of security forces , particularly of domestic violence , including freedom of freedom , including press freedom , independent journalist , blo@@ g@@ ger and other activists .
the authorities restri@@ ct peaceful and legitim@@ ate activities in human rights , systematically , activists , their views over the public affairs of the country such as corruption in authorities and institutions in both online and offline .
the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and the arrest of three of their editors in the last year is a hard blow for the press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper , which has been reported on corruption in Oman ( a absolute mon@@ archy ) since its inc@@ eption in 2007 , until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on 28 July 2016 , security forces Ibrahim Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , chief editor of Az@@ am@@ n , had been published in the newspaper on July 26 , 2016 . in it , there was corruption in the judicial system and the interference from high @-@ level officials in judicial decisions .
in the report , governmental officials accused the judge of the Supreme Court of Oman under pressure to raise a verdict in an inheritance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; issue of the Az@@ am@@ n Zeitung of 26 July 2016 with a report on the title page with the heading : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ ranking parties of justice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ ir Al @-@ Ab@@ ri , member of the Legal Committee , was charged by the ISS before the Special Department and was arrested by security forces upon arrival .
on 9 August 2016 , the ISS drew Deputy Chief Editor of You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who had served as Chief Editor based on Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is .
the newspaper was concluded at in@@ defin@@ ite period after the Information Minister had announced the statement that &quot; the publication and dissem@@ ination of the newspaper on any way , including online , on August 9 , 2016 . &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the first trial took place in Mas@@ k@@ at the first trial in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Ab@@ ri .
the Court condemned the three journalists to prison and ordered the final closing of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both accompanied by interference of the public order , &quot; abuse of the Internet &quot; and &quot; under@@ dig@@ ging of the pre@@ st@@ asy of the state . &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was also found guilty of violations of a publication of publication and debt .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j was sentenced to three year old pen@@ alties and fin@@ es in the amount of 3000 om@@ ic R@@ ial ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . Moreover , a single @-@ year professional for@@ b@@ ade was imposed against the two journalists .
al @-@ Ab@@ ri was sentenced to a year jail and a fine of 1000 R@@ ial ( 2600 US dollars ) after he was found guilty of use of an information network for dissem@@ ination of material that could represent a risk for public order . &quot;
on 22 August 2016 , Al @-@ Ab@@ ri was appointed a security deposit of 5000 Iber@@ ian R@@ ial ( 13@@ 000 US dollars ) and he was released from prison on 22 August 2016 .
at a hearing on 26 December 2016 at a hearing on 26 December 2016 , Al @-@ Ha@@ j sentenced to six months &quot; imprisonment for Al @-@ Ha@@ j .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was dismissed on 10 April 2017 following the prison of his six @-@ month prison sentence from the central prison in Mas@@ k@@ at . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison , where he has served his prison sentence .
in addition , the Court of Appeal confirmed the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
despite the decision of the Court , Az@@ am@@ n decided to re@@ locate the paper after attacks by the Iranian government .
on 8 January , the Minister of Information granted an order with which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the information minister personally signed a further instruction in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months and thus affir@@ med the Minister for the decision of the Appeals Court to allow the publication of the newspaper .
the continuous closing time of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which in Oman was injured during the recent period .
for other injuries , for example , the closing of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ at@@ ine and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country , can introduce their operations .
due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the arrest of journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression is that the om@@ ic authorities are still not willing to prepare an end for the extensive violation of the press freedom .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) demands the om@@ ic authorities on :
1 . You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j moved immediately and un@@ conditi@@ onally release ;
2 . create a safe environment for Az@@ am@@ n newspaper , so that their journalists can walk to their work ;
3 . protect freedom of press in the countryside and
4 . among all circumstances ensure that human rights and journalists gathered in Oman their right human rights work , and without fear of ret@@ ali@@ atory measures , including judicial cler@@ ics .
the Golf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization founded by the Gulf area and in neighbouring countries as well as the right to gather peace@@ fully , and it provides them protection .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understanding
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , figure out with his understanding
medical research in Africa is only rarely or not mentioned in the media . this is the growing area that addresses the most ur@@ gent matter of the continent .
for the need for medical research there are two reasons : for a lack of global healthcare , many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the special medical requirements on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ culosis and malaria have significant effects in the p@@ oo@@ rest countries in Africa than elsewhere , and lack of investments for the investigation of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies are a big problem .
secon@@ dly , research , which is carried out by African scientists in Africa , has its own research capacities in Africa . a larger role of science and technology can only be eligible for the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is director of the Centre for Inf@@ ectious diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) .
he grew in the 1990s in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just as the AIDS epide@@ mic was the first gra@@ dient to national health .
he left Zambia for studying in the United States , initially in Louis@@ iana , later in Indiana .
when Post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he resear@@ ched even on HIV @-@ virus before he decided to go back home to support the sam@@ ic health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and beyond this research .
( Dis@@ cla@@ imer : Dr. War@@ rier speaks to a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( G@@ V ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment , the focus is on the application of research results . in this process , I support the sam@@ ic national program for anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
I just star@@ ved a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ o@@ gens .
g@@ v : what are your opinion about the important current scientific topics in your country and general in Africa ?
how are they different from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only have solutions to have been developed somewhere else .
that must change , otherwise we will always remain the receiver instead of himself M@@ acher .
the solutions that we get , are often usable in our surroundings , and sometimes it is impossible to use them here .
g@@ v : where does financing and support come from ?
is it enough ?
how easy or difficult , to find suitable scientists for projects ?
RW : from USA and Europe .
the projects are funded differently well .
it is difficult to find people who want to return or to come here , because funding and development chances are better in other countries .
g@@ v : how is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work that you didn &apos;t had before ?
RW : basic infrastructure does not comply with standards in developed countries . it costs much money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratory materials is expensive , and it takes months to import them from other countries .
g@@ v : how is the public opinion about Science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there are already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would propose that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
g@@ v : as large , in your opinion , according to the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it concentrate , and how can we assist development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I &apos;ve seen great students of all age groups .
there are need of special scientific training , starting at any age .
social sciences , computer science , big data , research of space , health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and cont@@ ag@@ ious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine are benef@@ iting from it .
g@@ v : can you describe the advantages and dis@@ advantages of life as scientists in Africa against Western countries , based on your experience ?
RW : often there are the limited speed , things to do , and the equivalent values to scientific expertise , which represent the challenges .
the system that magazines are only accessible against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , also limits the amount of available information and speed of research .
from the USA to India : how &quot; Open Source &quot; seed producers of global food production change
this post of Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine published on solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank M@@ orton has been bred already since the 1980s in the USA salad .
its company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ dish , the first plant , which was added from NASA &apos;s ast@@ ron@@ au@@ ts in space , and has been consumed .
for almost 20 years , mort@@ al work was given only by its own off@@ ence and the question , how many oint@@ ments can he get limits .
but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s , he noticed that more sal@@ ads were patented , and that he could not only use them for breeding .
the patents are not only for individual varieties but also for certain properties like resistance to diseases , a special red or green or green leaves .
over the past few years , more such patents have been registered for more plants such as cer@@ eal or cart@@ ott@@ oman . due to this trends , plant breeding , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts have taken care of food safety in the future of food production .
as a passionate representatives of mill@@ en@@ nia @-@ mill@@ en@@ nia tradition , M@@ orton is still a salad , he needs to be longer , because his work will always be more con@@ stra@@ cted with always more con@@ stra@@ ints .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is when I would like to lie in a river which I have to bl@@ ing@@ le . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we must just do it , but it is a fra@@ cture with the breeding tradition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that these patents have to go far too far . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and if they be able to stand before judgment , no one can be patented anymore because all features are patented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he makes it so good as possible and trying to figure out those who want to figure out what he wants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , however , he is very careful and ende@@ av@@ oured to use any material that is protected as intellectual property .
he has also joined a movement which is always bigger in the United States and everywhere in the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; open source &quot; breeding ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ast@@ ron@@ au@@ ts of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; International Space Station &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have been cultivated and eaten red ro@@ y@@ sal@@ at in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; greenhouse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; station in the station &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; station in the station &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; station . &quot; &quot; &quot;

it is not a co@@ incidence that this name does rather sound so as the movement from the IT area would come and not from the area of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( Initiative for Open Source &quot; seed ) can be inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software , providing alternatives to copyright protected software .
it was launched in order to ensure that some plant species and gens are not protected as intellectual property and are suitable for plant breeding .
in the context of the initiative , called Oss@@ i &apos;s initiative , US bre@@ e@@ ders can also under@@ take to use that other one from them far@@ med seeds free of charge .
this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and do not sell it . &quot; open source &quot; bre@@ e@@ ders allow you to cross it to make your own s@@ orts - two aspects which are prohibited by many plant pat@@ rons or prescribed by many plant pat@@ rons .
dozens of bre@@ e@@ ders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014 .
whis@@ per@@ ing views
Professor of the University of Wisconsin @-@ Madison and Oss@@ i &apos;s board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are control of the seed and possibility of breeding new plants , both important for food security and environmental protection .
it plays an important role in larger coh@@ app@@ ings such as biodiversity , rights of farmers , control over the nutrition system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bre@@ eder would not attempt to use the latter , not just a little while making use of natural resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg is emphas@@ ised that the &quot; open source &quot; movement are not busy with genet@@ ically modified plants .
all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetable , grain , genet@@ ically modified or not , from environmental sustainability , which is the most recent examples of being offered in the global agricultural industry , such as being offered on farmers in August and September 2016 , should also know that the way how this vegetables is bred and threatened .
nutritional so@@ vereign without seed so@@ vereig@@ n@@ ty is not possible . &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed initiative under@@ take care of that their seed will continue to be available free of charge . thus , your advantages are in contrast to pat@@ enting seeds and plant features .

Oss@@ i @-@ Supp@@ orters argu@@ ed that the future of food supplies are endangered , since the available gen@@ e@@ pool due to the increasingly large @-@ quality intellectual property rights on plant material , which is therefore always limited to shr@@ ink .
Claire Lu@@ by , Executive Director of Oss@@ i , engaged in her PhD thesis with genetic variation on carr@@ ots and their availability . it found out that about one @-@ third of all raw materials are protected as intellectual property , making it either available either as a plant breeding .
for other plants , there are still no estimates , but experts , such as Lu@@ by , that massac@@ red plants such as wheat in even bigger style are patented as salad or carr@@ ots .
a question of vision
plants become so far@@ med that they have targeted attributes - from such that their taste or their colour improves until such , because of them prosp@@ ers and thre@@ ats like p@@ ests and diseases .
opponent of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for bre@@ e@@ ders are increasingly paying by more patents . genetic diversity be currently more need@@ less than ever before , since the changing conditions are much worse than ever before climate change are worse .
in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ spokesperson Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to believes that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ tos &apos;s activities . with altogether four cooperative banks and co @-@ operation with institutions such as the United States , set up the company for the preservation of the genetic diversity .
however , they contra@@ dic@@ ts that intellectual property is other bre@@ e@@ ders , since &quot; patents and the protection of plant varied innovation &quot; . &quot; a patent is basically taken into a plan that everyone can keep when the patent is expired .
often this instructions help others to come with another method to get the same result .
such a protection is not in@@ hib@@ its innovations , but encour@@ ages them to the public more material and know @-@ how can be made available . &quot;
M@@ orton does not look at it : 20 years to wait until a patent is certainly no innovations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you have to wait for a long time to make plants , which have been adapted to the changed environmental conditions , one would have lost the struggle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main argument for M@@ orton requires that genetic resources have always been a general public and continue to remain : &quot; independent plant breeding have neither the time nor the money for such form@@ alities , and mon@@ et@@ aries are not attractive for us .
we want to make farmers to ease their work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what is it that leads us , and it is impossible to use us if we are not able to use the best and most recent genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; all in all M@@ orton def@@ ends himself to patented , plant features : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are not creating the characteristics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plants form them out and the bre@@ eder , we finally have no idea how the plants do it .
a secret of nature . &quot;
for Carol Dep@@ pe , plant breeding in the U.S. state , Oregon and Oss@@ i &apos;s Executive Board , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; whoever builds a sort of breeding even his own values in them .
those who believes in industrial agriculture with large farms and mon@@ oc@@ ulture believes , are needed to produce measures in her@@ bic@@ ide , breeding in its varieties of this concept of agriculture .
my concept is highly respected . &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized enterprises ( such that move on international markets , but smaller than Z. B. Mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents , do not create most smaller seed companies , even without patents - either re@@ ject it or do it for too expensive and therefore do not re@@ mun@@ eration or both is the case .

M@@ orton is also known that bre@@ e@@ ders caused by the Av@@ oid of plant pat@@ rons : &quot; it looks like that I would like to produce something new in my effort to produce something stronger than companies , the pat@@ enting .
I need to do new material for my catalogue , since I know that my competitors are res@@ eller to sell my varieties in a few years ago , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent for 20 years ago it is just beautiful . &quot; worldwide reson@@ ance
indeed , the US seem to be the leader in the &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding leader , but the concept sp@@ read@@ eth quickly to all over the world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which itself itself as professional organisation in the area of resources , is an &quot; open source &quot; seed sector . &quot; to preserve the seed of traditional commercial applications , the centre of farmers collabor@@ ates and helps them to achieve new varieties that fulfill certain requirements .
it also supports them to come to &quot; Open Source &quot; -@@ seeds and sell their own .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Organization Agre@@ ements works on an &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; license which ultimately determin@@ es a formal and legally binding form of the Oss@@ i obligation for bre@@ eder in the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( regulations for breeding themselves differ from country to land , for the Oss@@ i obligation not just one can be found one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declares that conventi@@ onally bred plants should not be patented . thus , it speaks against the current practice of the European Patent Office , the patents applied on conventi@@ onally bred plants .
however , a statement is not yet a law ; now it is now to the governments of the Member States to implement the Patent Office to implement these new line .
in October 2016 the Dutch organization H@@ iv@@ os organized a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; plant systems in Ethiopia to speak non @-@ governmental organizations and seed companies from all East Africa to learn something about the &quot; Open Source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend towards pat@@ mentation of seeds .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for H@@ iv@@ os &apos; Program for Open Source &quot; seeds declares that the organization is currently generating a worldwide alliance for &quot; Open Source &quot; plant systems that will fall off the official start next year .
a merger of environmental and development groups ( including H@@ iv@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development organization US@@ C Canada and the action group on ero@@ sion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database to seed and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Ess@@ ential - An array of aid organisations such as W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - a report that farmers involved , to share it and to improve seeds , thus ensuring a stable supply of food supplies .
in the report , the importance of a varied , local supply is emphas@@ ized with seeds for sustainable food systems - an context , from the Lu@@ by of Oss@@ i , that soon more people will see him soon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the motion for regional and environmental foods are considered to be considered , and seed systems have hardly ever been added &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are trying to make people clear@@ er , that even more behind their food is &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human Rights Organization and Blog are the newest goals of the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in Egypt
an increasingly un@@ lock the Egyptian authorities in the internet .
this time it hit the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a column .
on the weekend of the 5th August the Egyptian government made the website of the Human Rights for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world .
in August , the network published a position on Facebook in which it critic@@ ized the Egyptian authorities for this step of sharp , promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region .
the law for Human Rights Information , in spite of this attack and the constitution of the Egyptian right and the Constitution by the authorities , has never been so difficult to overcome this part of the world , so that all technical possibilities would be exhau@@ sted , and not to ad@@ mit it . we wait on it to meet our task .
AN@@ HR@@ I is regarded as the first cen@@ sored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt , after the authorities blo@@ cked up the independent news page MA@@ DA Mas@@ r , Arabic @-@ speaking edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and Qatar of Qatar concerning con@@ gen@@ ital &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;

besides AN@@ HR@@ I there is no access to the blog of the colum@@ n@@ ist and human rights advoc@@ ated Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada is no access in Egypt .
Zi@@ ada took advantage of his blog for spreading of column and articles that he writes in Egypt &apos;s not accessible websites and media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the blog which he set up in order to b@@ yp@@ se the Z@@ ens@@ ur@@ ion of the Egyptian government , even the aim of an attack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
blo@@ g@@ ger , the supplier is native to Zi@@ adas blog , however , is further accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity , after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces , while he reported about the student protests and experienced a video as the police force physical violence against two students .
his article turn mainly around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a fac@@ ebook page , Zi@@ ada is expressed by the government and reflected what this means for him :
the blo@@ gs to lock is very old , but has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ att@@ ah al @-@ S@@ isi , and even if the blocking of blo@@ gs may not be meaning@@ ful for the world , it is now for two reasons for me :
1 ) It has managed to mediate to me the feeling of a siege ; an arrest , an attempt to murder , pre @-@ charging at the national Security Council , the blocking Blo@@ gs , and every other website , for which I worked .
2 ) You have proven that I wrote not in vain . in other words , my words have an effect if also only a small audience .
I want to mention that this Blog was one Archive for me .
first , I used it to the post of articles to handle the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship .
but now , after they have locked him , and that they are afraid of words , can I change the link or create a second blog .
the cour@@ ageous goes to the way up to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( AF@@ TE ) , Egyptian authorities opened up from 24 May to 06 August 133 web pages . this resulted in technical testing in the networks of different Internet Service Provider ( IS@@ P ) , including orange , Vod@@ af@@ one and Et@@ is@@ al@@ at .
AF@@ TE also documented the options of vend@@ ors , by changing newspaper c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship and private sur@@ fers , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
AF@@ TE reported in their research :
on Monday , June 12 , we be@@ ck@@ oned how to offer the blocking of websites that offer V@@ P@@ N@@ s .
a such practice indicates the intention of the government to block content and fil@@ tering content that could have access to the Egyptian users .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the situation will be changed in addition to the imp@@ lications of the sealed doors , so that the Egyptian population has no jurisdiction for the Egyptian population , through which it can proceed for judgment against these acts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship and who will attack them next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the people fight .

day for day report newspapers in all Brazil with host@@ els from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous posters .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old killed in school &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thief &apos;s pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President T@@ emer sends 8500 soldiers of the army , Marine and Air Force in Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of the economic crisis and in a severe financial situation , the wave of violence in Rio reached the highest booth for 10 years .
the Global Justice Organization &apos;s Brazilian non @-@ governmental organization even proclaimed the United Nations .
reports like these are all daily and this is un@@ acceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; at least the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as published for the detailed reporting on violence in Rio , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Extra Day on August 16 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is not normal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which she announced , a new heading called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; war in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all reports on violence in the city are now published there .
the figures for their decision declared the newspaper so :
extra will continue to report about crimes within any big city on the world , such as murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual violence , etc . everything that happens in Rio , will be published in the &quot; War &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative to complete our eyes as journalists in front of cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a quad@@ minute video which was dealt on Facebook , Oct@@ Ã¡@@ vio Gu@@ edes , the chief editor of the newspaper , that this decision was no occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure is :
extra is probably the single newspaper on all over the world with a war ru@@ in in a country that doesn &apos;t know the war .
in the same video , a journalist who explains the newspaper , according to the Institute of Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro 8@@ 43 territories , which are inspected by criminal organizations .
in the motto article the newspaper writes :
it is aware of that a war dis@@ course , if it is distor@@ ted , can also be used , cru@@ ises from the police , which only measures and then asks questions to negoti@@ ate .
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose goal is not the civilian population , but the economic power of m@@ af@@ ia and its partners is .
is the term &quot; war &quot; more than they used ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ cept Bras@@ il argu@@ ed the journ@@ alism as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to describe violence as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in their opinion , according to a just@@ ification of failed security policy through the media , and could make it difficult to tigh@@ ten responsibility in police force . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is no war .
this is the result of corruption and bad planning - how extra is shown in the analysis of military interest rates in Rio itself - in combination with in@@ sufficient investment in personnel , enligh@@ ten@@ ment and an historic and self @-@ neg@@ lec@@ ted public service .
reminder : the state of Rio de Janeiro is greater than only its capital .

there are no such cities in the state of Rio de Janeiro .

at the beginning , this fact resulted in a decrease of for@@ ci@@ ble deaths . for some years , the U@@ PP has led to several reports about massacres and repression against poor municipalities that actually should protect the neo @-@ aff@@ air police unit .
on his Facebook page , the journalist Jo@@ Ã£o Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux quoted his article from the year 2010 in which he explains why the violence in Rio isn &apos;t the way - by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term &quot; civil war &quot; .
he writes :
in addition to legal questions , the classification of the situation in Rio occurs as a war even serious consequences for human beings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for this calls for the state to use means and roads , which is typical for a war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the in@@ filtr@@ ate in the territory of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enemy &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is an illeg@@ itim@@ ate point in the landscape and to an object for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collapse damage &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ri@@ pped balls &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

to stay on life : besieged Syrians to plant mushrooms

source : Can@@ Do@@ Action
since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and the subsequent civil war many Syrian cities suffered under brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime opposed to lo@@ yal troops .
according to victories World@@ watch , a common initiative of the Peace Organisation PA@@ X and the Research Institute The Syria Institute , are located in Damascus and surrounding , H@@ oms , D@@ eir E@@ zz@@ or and Id@@ li@@ b , currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege .
the Eastern Gh@@ out@@ a region is particularly affected , where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 called the lives of hundreds of civilians .
many governments , international organisations , and the Syrian opposition , are based on the basis of investigations of the United Nations and other human rights organizations that the massacres of the Assad regime was committed .
since 2013 , these insur@@ g@@ els have been under siege under siege under siege under siege of Damascus , which caused a population to be carried out on locally or through tun@@ nels and control points .
due to the lon@@ gl@@ asting block , traditional food supplies are become in@@ accessible for large parts of the population .
as a counter @-@ assessment , a group of Syrian humanitarian aid and ac@@ adem@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of Eastern Gh@@ out@@ as , as they can plant their own mushrooms as &quot; vital food source . &quot;
they call themselves Gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ near and carry out the project together with the NGO Al No@@ ala .
mushrooms are not among the most commonly produced in Syria , and are extremely rare part of the Syrian cuisine . however their food does not make their food for many people of the besieged Eastern gh@@ out@@ a .
the Direc@@ tion of the Project , Sub@@ scription Nab@@ il , said on the French News Agency AFP :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we op@@ ted for the cultivation of mushrooms , because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because you can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dr. Ahmed L@@ eil@@ a , one of the organ@@ izers , reports Global Vo@@ ices , that has already been fighting for three years , this project is known to gain this project and pressed his relief that it gains more and more &quot; pleasure . &quot;
to collect money for the initiative , use the humanitarian Crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do in consultation with the NGO Gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ most .
it is planned to arrange 125 families knowledge about plant@@ ing fung@@ us , so Dr. L@@ eil@@ a to Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the Constitution of this article , they have reached over 100 % of its expected target from around 12,@@ 700 â¬ , but will continue to collect donations to Can@@ Do .
the initiative is attached to generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and humidity at 80 % .
due to the fuel short@@ age , locally produced hydro@@ carb@@ ons are used in plastic to supply the generators with the necessary energy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. L@@ eil@@ a said Global Vo@@ ices that they started with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; production from the regions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before they checked their quality , they are suitable for consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they planted a small mush@@ room farm in a tub . when they achieved , they used a larger tub . and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; teaching farm for the region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after 3 months , they have spread mushrooms throughout East Gra@@ out@@ a for free .
Dr. L@@ eil@@ a declared that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to settle the pilgrims from various reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; breaking of siege . &quot; &quot; &quot;
presenting a new food source in the market .

creating new jobs , particularly for women who work at home .
the creation of new jobs for people with disabilities , which are tied to their home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We hope to distribute this idea throughout the world , so that our success and our fight against hunger and siege is visible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want that our experiences are inspired by people in crisis areas and we can help mankind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Portuguese and Justice for the Vic@@ tims of Br@@ ush@@ es 2017
several hundred people protest@@ ed in many districts in Portugal and called justice for the victims of fires that sailed in the north of Portugal in the north of Portugal .
two and forty @-@ two people died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this took the government last week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
fires were also registered in the G@@ ali@@ zi@@ c region in Spain , where it was 4 dead .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 ligh@@ thou@@ ses , which spread over the northern and central regions of the country and reached approximately 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June , in Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o Grande there was a similar tragedy in the city of Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured .
according to the European Fore@@ stry regulation , which is monitored by satellite images in Portugal alone , approximately 500,000 acres of forest consumed in Portugal alone - a surface area of the area of Lisbon .
in order to make you a better picture of the ear@@ nest of the location : there is no fire only in 4 districts .

the se@@ eable tragedy
the goal of the protests from Saturday was the demand for better relief and fire fighting measures through the state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people asked why the civil protection was not in the position to indicate the extent of tragedy so far as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jo@@ Ã£o So@@ ver@@ al of the Federation of farmers in Portugal declared the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
after Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o , roads and villages were evacu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
these Sunday , they did so no@@ where : there are dozens of events in open streets which were surrounded by fire .
in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy could happen again as in June , since the streets were closed very late . &quot;
furthermore , construction permits are covered in Ã@@ r@@ t@@ una with high Bran@@ dr@@ is@@ iko .
a large proposal for the Wal@@ vis Bay , which had resulted in the government after serious bre@@ aches in 2003 and 2005 , was imposed by the commun@@ es that saw the new rules as an obst@@ acle for investments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government led a loos@@ ening of the law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the applicant has means of funds for self @-@ protection , that was an open back@@ door that everything could be built , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jo@@ Ã£o Sor@@ val was on the same article in the paper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the environment Organization of Quer@@ cus , made it atten@@ tive that large surfaces with eu@@ cal@@ ypt@@ us trees , trees from easily flamm@@ able wood , as in a Teu@@ fel@@ sk@@ aya , according to the walls of this type ever further spread .
to these problems we have added that the website of the civil protection of Portugal on October 15th and 16th , when residents were looking for information or attempted to contact relatives , who was offline .
it was a private initiative that provided people with information : they used the own civil protection data using the application f@@ og@@ os.@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the developers Jo@@ Ã£o P@@ ina in order to simpli@@ fy the work of the fire brig@@ ade in October , so that the server followed by the ons@@ lau@@ ght of 400@@ ,000 users that followed fires , the website counted more than half a million .

even if his mother didn &apos;t say that she didn &apos;t know that she would not see her son much longer - maybe even more .
to break the boy in the morning .
his un@@ cle would recover him and bring him to the body .

Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of Haz@@ ara dominated party He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat , was murdered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara felt themselves .
the Taliban went for their hat@@ red on the Haz@@ ara @-@ Taliban .
many Haz@@ ara left the country toward Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af found himself again in Pakistan .
for a few years he worked in a coh@@ es@@ et . the work was hard and made him sick .
then he took what was left of his low wage , and walked in Iran . once again he was in a foreign country together with other refugees and drag@@ ged bags with mort@@ ars , the he@@ avier than he himself to earn his life .
back then , as today was the life of Afghan refugees in Iran imp@@ acted by mis@@ ery and exploitation .
&quot; it was really hard , rec@@ alled A@@ shar@@ af in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afghan refugees ) lived in an empty building on the building site , where we also worked .
there were no services there and no heating . we hanged nylon in front of the open window , so that we don &apos;t resist the night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left his life without papers in Iran and made himself ready for travel to Europe .
during the dangerous crossing on the sea he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and stran@@ ded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek authorities had rejected his asylum request , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 .
some time A@@ shar@@ af is hom@@ eless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed twice a day in charity .
it is true that Italy is a second chance for asylum seek@@ ers . it is true , however , that the conditions that apply for asylum seek@@ ers in the country has been cat@@ ast@@ roph@@ ic .
the human rights organisation of the Liber@@ ian Union for Europe writes , the system &quot; suffer from a general lack of transparency .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the vast majority of asylum seek@@ ers is housed in more than 3000 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special recording centers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; this is a impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ skilled and un@@ prepared staff . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Italian Law , the asylum seek@@ ers can only be assigned to a recording centre , if they are officially given an application for asylum - what may go after the registration of asylum seek@@ ers .
by then there are people who have no money for accommodation , or have to sleep to the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street .
so it was A@@ shar@@ af .
but his un@@ mist@@ ak@@ e@@ worthy hab@@ it helped A@@ shar@@ af is going to free from these conditions .
after he had made various work in the construction industry for several years , A@@ shar@@ k moved his entire creation in the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice .
this was so good that he was still a second hostel and opened a speed .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ at@@ is &apos;s success story is now a theme of the &quot; handic@@ apped Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( english : &quot; behind the Venetian Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director Am@@ in Wah@@ id@@ i .
the movie received the Venice City Award in 2017 , which has been awarded for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepren@@ eurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
lots of bureau@@ cracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are only some of these obstacles .
according to un@@ official estimates , approximately 20,000 Afghanistan live in Italy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for many of them the country is a transition solution on the way to other European countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last few years some of Afghanistan @-@ driven companies were created , including s@@ enti@@ als , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afghan restaurants have even been praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ mad@@ i had the idea of his restaurant Oriental Experience , where the wa@@ iter and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant is told by the various Afghan , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes the history of their journey to Italy .
the Afghan entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Padua the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the p@@ izzeria Kab@@ ul@@ og@@ na in Bologna , and a S@@ ushi Restaurant in Rome .
A@@ shar@@ af@@ s aims , however , far beyond the Italian cuisine industries and retail , and aim to return to the country that he had to leave to leave the teen@@ ager .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where a risk is , there are ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ af &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I never forget my land and I can &apos;t live happy if I don &apos;t know that my people suffer .
I have a project for farmers from the p@@ oo@@ rest provinces of the country , especially for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they represent half of the company and need to get the same options as all others . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af endor@@ ses plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul , where people can learn packaging and preserv@@ ative technologies . &quot; thus , they can sell their seri@@ ousness on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; he says .
the development of the successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through un@@ certainty and doub@@ ts , but at the end stand stability and pro@@ sper@@ ity .
A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey itself . now , he wants to help others in this way .

the Egyptian parliament is reviewed a bill , which proposes that users can only use social media such as Twitter or Facebook after a registration office in a government authority .
users must be able to use social networks , within six months after the successful Legislative Decree on the website of the authority pursuant to its full name as well as their identification number .
those who missed this step could be sentenced to six months of imprisonment or the cancellation of a criminal payment .
the law , which was designated by sixty parliamentary members , is presently the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and will be deb@@ ited there .
may , one of the Chamber of Dep@@ uties an act of parliament to be introduced in the har@@ der stra@@ ins of the President or of a high civil servants .
about Egyptian right is the recovery of the President as well as state facilities already stra@@ ce@@ able . however , among the law , a such fact should be made with prison and money @-@ pen@@ alties , as the right wing of the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy .
should the law be adopted , this may be up to three years in prison for the convicted .
in addition , it would be a political climate that has the right to freedom of expression and freedom of interests in danger since many years .
a striking example of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud subscription Z@@ id ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) was arrested on 13 August 2013 , when he demonstrated Egyptian police officers attemp@@ ting to demonstr@@ ating violence against the military coup led by Mohammed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan waited , as more than 700 protest participants had been arrested in the same incident , four years in detention to a court .
recently , his trial was post@@ pon@@ ed to the 20 May because the prison term of human rights activists fail to put the def@@ endants from prison in the court .
Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty due to a , so many human rights groups are united , pseud@@ o @-@ proof of arms , illegal con@@ vocation , murder , and attempted murder .
in another case a criminal case held in G@@ iza the two journalist H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were indicted for their coverage to pro @-@ Mor@@ si seat block@@ ade on the Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya place in Cairo .
the court also reduced the pen@@ alties of the journalist Abdullah al @-@ fact har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Mustafa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly who were also arrested in the case of the af@@ o@@ rem@@ enti@@ oned incident , from 25 years to 5 years .
tun@@ es@@ ian activists g@@ list@@ ens to continuous documents
in May , Tunis@@ ian authorities spent six hours with the inter@@ rog@@ ation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia who co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ acy Project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia was mainly ob@@ sc@@ aled to an en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed action plan for the President of the Republic , backed by the President of the Republic , to ensure business@@ men and during the former regime through dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Ab@@ id@@ ine Ben Ali by corruption , in@@ sof@@ ar as those all corrup@@ ted funds returned .
this document , which was published on April 21 , on the website of Na@@ wa@@ ate , casts a light on it as the presidential plans for the support of the legisl@@ ature .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia rejected the nam@@ ing of his sources under indication of Article 11 of the Tunis@@ ian press contractor , which journalists secured the right to protect their sources .
yet he entered the District Court in Tunis on 9 May .
will China for@@ cing the users of social media to submit their identification ?
according to the new rules of the Information Council of the People &apos;s Republic of China , users need social media in China for authorisation before they write messages in social media .
in addition , in addition , the registration will be necessary for full @-@ party name registration .
analy@@ st concerns that by elimin@@ ating anonymous comments in entertainment in social networks , it is said to be un@@ clear how the authorities will apply these regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chinese citizens suggested in social media to implement these regulations only selec@@ tively to protect the journ@@ alism and independence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you see us in &quot; We@@ chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
may the state c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of Russia locked up the access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app @-@ chat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ros@@ kom@@ n@@ ad@@ z@@ or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; circum@@ navigate to the National government as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; organizer of the information &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this name is part of a law from the year 2014 , thanks to the Russian government to organize a list of online services . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the law also allows the government to make responsible for the removal of content and force them on request for the use of user data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to these websites , websites such as V@@ contacts and Od@@ no@@ c@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the e @-@ mail service la@@ .ru and dozens of other services .
Turkish Court dispos@@ es of blocking Wikipe@@ di@@ as
a Turkish Court granted sper@@ mat@@ di@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia administrators refused to delete two bil@@ ingual article , the indications that Turkey support the jihadists in Syria .
the Turkish Ministry for Transport , Marine Affairs and Communication was closed because they were closed to &quot; an information source that collabor@@ ates with groups to attack a political diff@@ user campaign against Turkey . &quot;
it is the first time that Turkey completely blocks the website . in addition to China , one of the few countries worldwide , in which the access to Wikipedia are not possible .
