<seg id="1">Although I had visited the US since 2012 at least once a year, I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love to America is extremely large.</seg>
<seg id="4">As many of my-generation I grew up with American films, I have taught American music, American authors and operated his sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had a great profound effect on me that I was mainly based on an American film journalist.</seg>
<seg id="6">When the 14-year-old I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Granistle in The Pelican letter, a fearless Reporter, who received his interest in the Supreme Court with judges who wanted to occupy his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "free to Method Man," "" "it was if that is the absolute truth, forget everything else I want to make with my life." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona, I had only strengthened my admiration for the USA.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "I said," "" "America is the only country where I ever lived, whose diversity is so welcoming, that you are always that you are, and there is easy acceptance in a community of equal human beings." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">I had even written a very nice love book about its greatness.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written over the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me, as he is surrounded with its bottleness.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never stops behind the mountain, as you say so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="16">He predicts what he considers, as a former colleague it express, and publicly declared his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, AfroAmerican and Women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, people who reacts on his statements, and voted for him in hair for him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes against the Republican elections in the Republican elections were the highest number formed by the party.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans that support these biguous person, then I asked me?</seg>
<seg id="21">I was not able to get Trump and his electors in accordance with the people which I met in Phoenix during my time.</seg>
<seg id="22">As for example my Professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism program, receives people from around the world, a deeply-faith man, by whom I was able to talk about Islam and its past.</seg>
<seg id="23">Also, Trumps Propose not voted by Peter Bhatia, the present editor of the "Cincinnati Inquirer," survived.</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met for our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to watch the "Phoenix" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trumps Intolerance is also in contrast to the generosity of movement that I experienced in Sandy Bahr, who fought their lives for the environment, and her husband Dave, my guest family that treated me as their son.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even it fits them to the commitment of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me with patience and wormwood and helped us to get to the complexity of the American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors whose wise counsel have helped me much at my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "these people and those who have shortened the values of" "" "deep love to America" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump on his way to the nominated republican presidential data, they throw me a stop and the counterpart at his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, it turned out that they were the exception of rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On 8 November 2016 there were over 50 million Americans, mostly white, the presidency of a man, despite - or maybe due to his contempt against non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The confrontation with the idea that people voted for Trump, because they were either partakers with his racism and fanaticism, because they were ready to see these things, broke out almost the heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to describe Trump-voters as the assists.</seg>
<seg id="34">Afforded people, said one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">That is superficial and respectless and indicates an inability to understand those who act in a different way and think.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows the people that their worries and fearful changes will not be considered by the hectic changes in their congregations.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters have voted for Trump, because they would like to rewin their control of a country that they have disappointed?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they might perhaps say that they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps too.</seg>
<seg id="40">But you can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who commenting the cruel decision to raise a man that looks down with contempt on those who look different than he.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "this" "" "Whitelash" "" "(AC)." "" ": as much as" "" "rejection of White against all other ethnicities," "" "The wording of white for white and whiplash" "", "how great Van Jones declared," "" "has been killed just what America did so great." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world estimate the American Ideal - no matter whether myth or reality, it is still a powerful idea - what faith or background you may always have, America is called every welcome.</seg>
<seg id="43">Because this country selected as his president, twice the son of a Kenyaners whose history as he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible.</seg>
<seg id="44">With the election of Donald Trumps, there is a huge part of white America's promise and say: to Hell with versatility, religious freedom and the whole concept of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In the America after 9 / 11 the white man is again at the Ruder, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">At all, I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">At a rally for Hillary Clinton Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would have my son, captain Humayer Kahn, a place in your United States?" he asked Mr. Khan.</seg>
<seg id="49">The multitude answered with a loud "No!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"didn't Muslims in your United States?"</seg>
<seg id="51">No!! "roar the amount.</seg>
<seg id="52">"have Latinos a Place in your United States?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered them.</seg>
<seg id="54">Have Afro-American has a place in your United States? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "" "" "they called them, and their voices were loud." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "if someone who is not like you, is a place in your United States?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a vocal and loud "NEIN"!</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan ended with the words: "God be thanks, Mr. Trump, is that not your Americas." 36 hours later he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The country, for which his son had fallen, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is now Trumps Land, told the message.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people who look like Mr. Khan, could not find space in this new America anymore.</seg>
<seg id="62">And I break my heart.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero congregation in the province of Oaxaca, with the children of the paraguaic city of Cateura together?</seg>
<seg id="70">That the music played in both places is not only the life of children, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the garbage</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a great garbage dump, only 16 Kilometers south from Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial city, which is very popular among tourists, but worlds far from nearby groovarian ruins and its world famous kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="73">For some years now the La Banda de Música (Music band) is now playing in the municipality: one of the existing symphony orchestra which, with their musical instruments, has a possibility to overcome them in the surrounding poverty.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students is become a central interest for the municipality of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The commune, which is located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for her drugs, abuse and gangs violence.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot, who started a musical project and the youth offered as a rare hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">Young band members take their obligations towards the music group very serious, the local press noticias Oaxaca NVI writes:</seg>
<seg id="79">Once they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch, they run through the dust roads to meet their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They always come and play with shiny eyes and play in the bustle day for day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, timpani, Bongos and the Conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from the garbage</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero's children play the children of Cateura - a village, which is practically on the largest landfill of Asuncion in the capital capital - on instruments which are made from recycleated waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with recovered instruments made from local firm waste materials, made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura where the Recycler under management of Favio Chávez started to transform parts of the waste in instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments imitate violin, viola, celli, double bass, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and percussion, which were made out of rubbish.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classic music, folk music, paraguayischen and Latin American music as well as music from the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra, etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article in the Los Angeles Times Favio Chávez is reminiscent of the local environmental and musical teachers of the children of Cateura, at the beginning:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no room for rehearsals and we had to teach in the same place. the children knew not music and it was very difficult to contact their parents, because many of them do not live with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">That changed when Favio was shown, what he had never seen before: a violin made from waste.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today, there is a complete orchestra which plays instruments of recovered material and is called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary named "Landmark Harmonic" (Harmonic garbage dump) draws the musical achievement:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world generates about one billion tons of waste every year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and are living with him - like people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they walk in something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra with its inspiring spectacle of rubbish-to-music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra played his music even before Pope Francis:</seg>

<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine published by international, practiced solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">The re-publication is conducted in the context of a agreement with Global Voices for the common use of content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa, it was known that this ship had already run illegitimate fishing waters in Liberian waters, before it visited Africa's other coast.</seg>
<seg id="101">The Eastern African countries were brought to this way, and slightly oblique to be called a lawyer of this kind to its coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Komors, Mozambique and Seychelles mobilized quickly against the ship. they refused to withdraw one of their harbours and refused to give him a fishing permit.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly the Prime Minister is surrounded by countries which you simply refused," "" "Benedict Kiilu, an executive employee of the Kenyan fishing authority," "" "he is part of a team that discovered the ship in time and followed." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013, the ship was driven out of the waters in the region: it was not succeeded to catch the fish.</seg>
<seg id="105">Finally, there was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars on Liberia, due to pillaging the fish stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The nucleus of this initiative, the criminal practices and resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NGO Stop illegal Fishing (Illegal Fisheries Stop).</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network in Somalia and Madagascar are the six countries that the Premier had driven out their waters at that time.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "" "" "we have eight countries, which are equivalent and work together." "" "says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trusts Project Ending illegally illegal. this project offers FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fisheries is unregulated by definition: what is being caught, is hidden, corrupted because of it is extremely difficult. thus, the illegal fishery is a main cause of overfishing of regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">Through the deliberate misuse of existing laws, by which certain habitats and species are to be protected, the illegal fishing ecosystems which have a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">But during actions against illegally cratic hurdle with bureaucratic hurdle with the information between individual countries, these actions took place in real time, with traceable on FISH-i's digital communications platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There may be able to exchange individual countries, such as lists of existent licenses, news related activities or details, which had been noticed or experienced during a harbour inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i persecuted the activities of ships also very attentive if they move on the open sea by satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This allows to mark the authorities to mark ships which fish in banned territories. also, such a raced ride will discover that a ship invites its caught fish onto another ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such investigations may show if the ships took a fish catch, where they were traveling and possibly even if they have a criminal.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegal fish catch can be refused on the basis of these information then the acceptance of such ships can be purchased in their ports. and that ships could not sell their load as the result of penalties, as in the case of the Premier.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "then there is considerable financial losses for the owner, what means that the illegal fish catch is financially worthwhile." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">And that's what we want to achieve, "says Per Erik Bergh, Chief Director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consulting firm supporting the fight against illegally fisheries in Africa and also supports FISH-i too.</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The already mentioned platform was created to win over 20 million USD in lost sales, which lose eight members of the HISH network every year because of illegal fishermen, penetrate in East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fish in East Africa, which attracts the whole world of commercial fish from around the world. also these illegal fishermen use it.</seg>
<seg id="122">These practices include actions like the sailing under false flag, counterfake license papers, information of phantasiencies, fishing protected species and fish areas.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "if you utilize the lack of international cooperation and do not make the weaknesses of a non-quito control system," "" "says Long." "" "could tell a ship illegally fishing and a country could say 'You must not let my port run." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="124">But another country could say 'Comm to me'. "and precisely this legale hatch is trying to close FISH-i now.</seg>
<seg id="125">The closed front works so far.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i was involved in more than 30 studies.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has revealed criminal networks to spread the fake licences in Tanzania. it discovered ships which used several fraudulent identities and found it-volatly ships and found it.</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to its co-operation with Interpol, the international authority for combating crimes, FISH-i can share information on illegal fishing over long distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "" "" "some of our investigations lead us quite far to the networks," "" "Bergh says." ""</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that FISH-i is to help you who utilize ships in precise ships.</seg>

<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system that has always been developed further, helps to hide illegal ships in order to hide themselves.</seg>
<seg id="133">"the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position." says Duncan Copeland, Chief analyst deals with Trygg Mat Tracking, a NGO which deals with fishing data and FISH-i technical support.</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships run for example their automatic identification systems, where they can no longer be added by satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">Zoeland helps to build a system that combines various information systems. FISH-i help to find criminal ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But FISH-i's team of African nations can actually take effect on the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fisheries?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes it.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth opened the Platform Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Maritime Protection organisation Oceana, a platform that offers satellite data, and through which the position of each individual traceable ship can be displayed worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "" "" "in order to get a better picture of it, those who do what makes it," "" "he says." "" "here is a chance for countries to help themselves and to bundle their resources for the investigation." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "we should do this at a global level." "" "Pew Charitable Trusts has a similar project to run with which a global system allows persecution of ships." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities do not only feel crime, but they are also locusts.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships containing previously unlicensed and hardly with consequences, we know that they are observed.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in FISH-i involved a 33% rise in fishing investments, since then fishing boats could buy more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i Somalia helped Greko 1 pact together, the inspectors found there on board locks on board whose use is prohibited.</seg>

<seg id="147">"" "also other countries notice this successes." "" "the effect is so important that we now also copy other countries," "" "said Kiilu." "" "we have become a study project." "" "in West Africa, several hundred millions dollars annually through illegal fisheries." ""</seg>
<seg id="148">There will be six countries together, to the so-called West Africa Task Force. even they fight the illegal fisheries, according to exactly the same model like FISH-i. "With Security, the aim is to emerge even more such initiatives and structures even in other regions," says Copeland.</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently, FISH-i's youngest member states asked his first major triumph in October: in October, Greko 1, a ship that was travelling under false flag, and was not only used to use towing networks, which are now prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="150">"" "the ship was still located in prohibited waters that were reserved for fishermen made up of Somalia." "" "with the take-out of measure against Greko 1, emphasises a strong sign that they go against illegal fish catch," "" "Bergh" "". "" ""</seg>

<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father to view the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentine city Córdoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">As now grown, Quijano said as part of the great La Perla Ribera trial in the province of Cordoba against his father.</seg>
<seg id="201">In the trial which ended on 24 August 2016, crimes were studied, which have committed during the Argentinean military dictatorship.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano have not sought out his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Starting at the office, same name as his father bear to the brutal group of military operations in the La Perla prison, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">He kept the family secret for 34 years.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation it was, I thought that was fine.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child with 15 years you do not notice that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">I could not know that my father was a thief, the following, and murderers.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis had no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was Gendarclerk. during the Argentinean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a time of state terrorism, his father from 1976 to 1978, had been deputy chief of the secret service of 141 under the prison La Perla.</seg>

<seg id="214">His story shows what great power is a parent, and how this child chose a way of salvation.</seg>
<seg id="215">From the Sports Hall to the Military Center</seg>
<seg id="216">When my father began to take me to the military base, I often went into the sports hall. there I had also stopped with a boy who made war sport.</seg>
<seg id="217">All they called him "Kent."</seg>
<seg id="218">I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black-and-white photo and called me to identify my friend.</seg>
<seg id="219">He said:</seg>
<seg id="220">You are a dickhead, you are getting friends with one of the ERP.</seg>
<seg id="221">Pass only that they don't carry you a day, and I will save you.</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide spread of translation defects are multifaceted.</seg>
<seg id="377">To translate, you need two important abilities: passive language skills to understand the output text and active language skills to transmit him into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active rule of the target language - something that is in the native language. generally, the conviction shall be in the target language - not in the language language - not in the native language - native language.</seg>
<seg id="379">Thus a French mother language should translate from English by French into French - not from French into English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo of Flickr-User Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ workers with English as the mother tongue, the translation of English could be attributed to English, cost-reasons or the relatively small number of English speakers that learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies that have no foreign employees have to make translation work together. then the Japanese staff, whose Englishlist is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really good.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo of Flickr-User Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translations are widespread in widespread use - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The worrens and higmatic phrases that arise by mechanical translation, show that this technology can substitute for a long-term translators. this applies to some languages all very special.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strange English formukings in Japan, among them the donkey prints, often used t-shirts or handlebars, are only used for stylish reasons - not to be read or understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo of Flickr-User Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors like jewelry still acceptable or at least harmless. but of big companies or from the government who have the means to guarantee higher standards, you can expect more detailed translations.</seg>
<seg id="389">The city of Kyoto takes place in the future, hopefully a further source of their translations.</seg>

<seg id="500">Picture by Pixabay, changes by Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="501">Published by the Public Domain CC0.</seg>
<seg id="502">Sixty Egyptian parliamentary members recently agreed a bill to "the Regulation on the use of use and social networks."</seg>
<seg id="503">"" "when he is accepted by Parliament, users must register for social media in Egypt with a government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter." ""</seg>
<seg id="504">Based on the law, then a site would then be established in order to take advantage of the social media, citizens and citizens to share social media.</seg>
<seg id="505">Within six months with the adoption of the law, users would have to register with their right names and identity numbers to use social networks.</seg>
<seg id="506">If it is missed to do this, this could bring a penalty of up to six months' imprisonment or a fine.</seg>
<seg id="507">The bill, which consists of six paragraphs, and in local media including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media than "jedwede use that will run on the Internet and is used to communicate with others through voice, video and text."</seg>
<seg id="508">It is unclear how the law is set through it, since the draft is no indication, as the Egyptian government shall not register upon the fact that the Egyptian government is currently not able to ensure that the Egyptian government is currently not able to guarantee the regulation on the level of social media enterprise.</seg>
<seg id="509">Riyad Abdul Sattar, parliamentary committee and promoter of the Law, told the magazine Al Monitor, registered users, and a password "to enter a password by the Firewall gate, the Facebook blocked."</seg>
<seg id="510">This could mean that Egypt is planning a firewall on national level around Facebook. due to them it would be necessary to submit information to the Egyptian and Egyptians to access the network to the network.</seg>
<seg id="511">But it is not known that such plans do exist.</seg>
<seg id="512">Experts and experts are sceptical regarding the technical feasibility of action.</seg>
<seg id="513">Ramy Raoof, Senior Research Technological (at German "senior research scientist") of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR, in German "Egyptian Initiative for personal rights"), told Global Voices:</seg>
<seg id="514">I strongly recommend to technical capacities and understanding any authority in Egypt either concerning things that have to do with technology.</seg>
<seg id="515">In my opinion, they imagine, that just as they were able to control physical public and private rooms, it could also be done online.</seg>
<seg id="516">If I think it, then means that they will apply a strong surveillance system to construct citizens, or not. and this means a crazy system to monitor the activities of humans and also to compose it to a trial.</seg>
<seg id="517">This is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible.</seg>
<seg id="518">"" "" "" "to be adopted as a law, the draft must be discussed at the elections of the Parliament and the constitutional complaints before it comes into the plenary debate." ""</seg>
<seg id="519">Whether his acceptance and enforcement has been successful or not, the draft "is in line with a pro-military mind in parliament, in whose sense it is necessary and ensured that no different repositations are present on the image area," says Raoof.</seg>
<seg id="520">Last year, Tamer El-Shahawy proposed legislation against cyber criminality in which a life-term sentence for those intended to threaten "public order to threaten" public order "and" to protest. "</seg>

<seg id="526">A subspecies of the greater family of leopards, which originates from Africa and Asia, belong to the Persian Leopards (Panthera pardus saxicolor). they are between 800 and 1,000 animals, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature. they are due to us, loss and fragmentation of their habitat, and there are always fewer prey.</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this particular kind of leopards so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">Like Raza in the video shows, "the Persian is the only remaining predatetier in the Kurdish ecosystem" and the health and thrives of the ecosystem also depends on that a big catfish is present.</seg>
<seg id="529">The chance to see a Persian Leopards are really visible in the wild bobsleigh and is about zero. when the team in the video shows that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera, Raza broke out in a pure joy.</seg>
<seg id="530">When educated Biologist shows Raza passionate about another side of her country, which consists not only from war and conflict.</seg>
<seg id="531">Since six years she has been involved in field studies on wild living animals and educational programs of Nature Iraq.</seg>

<seg id="539">"view from the Shield High School to Shiasawa, Minami Sanriku (Miyagi)."</seg>
<seg id="540">Shielawa was destroyed by the tsunami on March 11, 2011, and still is the restoration work with the reconstruction.</seg>

<seg id="544">In early March 2017, the daily Kahoku Shimpo, the progress made in northeastern Japan were committed to rebuild the life of those who had been affected by the "triple catastrophe," a tsunami and an atom accident in Fukushima had caused the catastrophe.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung, located in Anai, located in Miyagi Prefecture. Miyagi Prefecture was a tremendous prefectures in Japan's northeast, which both had to experience the earthquake and the resulting tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbor of Fukushima and Iwate were forced evacuated, because the tsunami had vanished whole cows from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">Even in this end, the Fukushima Prefecture had experienced a nuclear accident, even so alone, 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows from local perspective, which have been achieved six years later to rebuild the life of local residents.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper includes both statistics of Japanese rebuilding authority as well as survey results of the affected themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">The residence in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo Zeitung reports that a total of 77 percent of the planned replacement stores (law-president, saigai kouei juutaku) has been completed in the prefectures Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate.</seg>
<seg id="552">Miyagi's largest success could be found among the three prefectures, 80 percent of the planned spare parts were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 per cent of such houses, whereas Fukushima will remain the final light with 70 percent.</seg>
<seg id="554">Nevertheless, six years after the catastrophe, we are trying to relocate the evacuation of accommodation (the world, casetsu juutaku) in final replacement houses.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the Thirty catastrophe, almost 80 000 people were forced to live in home-education.</seg>
<seg id="556">Still 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate lived in such services still in December 2016.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 percent of the evacuated victims of Fukushima are still living in emergencies, whereas at Miyagi was successful. over 75 per cent of the evacuated evacuation that were settled after the disaster in accommodation, were settled in final homes.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate the figure is 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and daily routine in the three concerned prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">Like the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung, have received 1074 of 1100 schools that were affected by the harm to the end of December 2016, which makes nearly 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, the industrial reconstruction was far more difficult in the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="562">While nearly 100 per cent of fish ports in Iwate and Miyagi are now back into operation, only 30 percent of fishing ports have rerecorded their operation in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and nuclear accident, having pulled in the three prefectures of agriculture in the country.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi could recover 93 percent of its agricultural areas, only 66 percent of the farmland in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that only one episode of the atomic fact is, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares destroyed the farmland of Fukushima, in the nuclear wave area. "</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures, tourism has gone up again, but he left Fukushima far back here.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist figures in Miyagi and Iwate are back up to 90 percent at the same time as before the harm. Fukushima however can have only 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo Zeitung reports that since the disaster has almost half of the coastal towns, it was more difficult to earn their lives.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population being prepared for the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to determine a complete picture, the newspaper introduced numerous surveys conducted among the local population and evacuated by the evacuation of the rebuilding and also how their receiving exchange has changed from the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction of the article the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo led a survey to bring more about the tsunami consciousness among the native population of experience.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey carried out that 83.1 percent of resident population will have taken hold in order to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of respondents say that still not enough to be done for catastrophes prevention.</seg>
<seg id="575">What about those who had to be evacuated from the Fukushima Prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">In their edition to the anniversary of the earthquake, Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has strengthened its attention to the situation of evacuated from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima had not only had to experience the devastating earthquake and devastating tsunami, no, the prefecture of Fukushima was also a witness of the worst, catastrophic undisturbances, nuclear accident in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="578">Of 160 000 evacuated victims from Fukushima were nearly 63 000 people in areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016, some more than 23 000 people, back to Fukushima, had been settled in permanent replacement houses.</seg>
<seg id="580">As of 2017, there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima still living outside their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the catastrophones, most of the evacuations have been missed, are older than 50 years old. they are not able to compete in correct accommodation because the efforts are competing for the reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima. this is the construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games to be held in Tokyo in 2020.</seg>

<seg id="595">A Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit: last Friday, a police officer had defeated him during a demonstration in Goiânia, with a stroke against the head. in nationwide, millions of demonstrators participated in a protest march towards Sparks.</seg>
<seg id="596">Mateus Ferreira da Silva, studied social sciences at the University of Goiás, has suffered a skull of brain trauma and several fractures.</seg>
<seg id="597">Doctors operated him on this Saturday and now brought him into an artificial compa.</seg>
<seg id="598">Its condition is considered critical.</seg>
<seg id="599">The local photo journalist Luiz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mateus sitting in Brazil for a few days quickly.</seg>
<seg id="600">On the pictures, the vision of the police officers can be seen, who identified with a stroke. the man was identified as Augusto Sampaio.</seg>
<seg id="601">After the incident the military police in the Brazilian state of Goiás announced that Sampaio was suspended until the conclusion of the investigation of the active service suspended.</seg>
<seg id="602">The pictures show the police officers, as he held in Goiânia, with his impact on the face of the student Mateus Ferreira (photos: Luiz da Luz).</seg>
<seg id="603">If a police officers were beaten by a demonstrators and lending on an intensive care station, his face would be seen for six months on television and all repression would be justified.</seg>
<seg id="604">The Facebook page "Desolalizador," a press channel of media activists from Goiânia, divided by Luiz da Luz, which one sees when Mateus will be attacked by police officers and several sanitary ware shortly after him.</seg>
<seg id="605">Another video with the same scenes, but from another perspective, is also emerged in social networks.</seg>
<seg id="606">Clip shown below shows the attack on Mateus down the 50th second.</seg>
<seg id="607">For Mateus the family lives in another state, Internet users have donated 10,000 Brazilian reais (approximately 2,700 Euro) to meet a portion of costs for medical care and to stay in Goiânia, while he is in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="608">Be valiant, Mateus.</seg>
<seg id="609">Against police force "</seg>
<seg id="610">The drawing has been divided several times in social networks.</seg>
<seg id="611">By: Heitor Vilela. publication with permission.</seg>
<seg id="612">On Facebook, Professor Pablo Ortellado is calling for more violent attacks against activists in Goiás.</seg>
<seg id="613">Goiás experiences a wave of political force: here the activist Guilherme Irish was murdered by his father, because he was a occupied school with a gas leaky. here, after having been attacked by a policemen who had been attacked by a policemen who had hit him with a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="614">Police dispropes</seg>
<seg id="615">Goiás was not the only state in Brazil where it came on the last Friday, brutal police operations against demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="616">Policemen sat on protests in the center of Rio de Janeiro, where demonstrators had built a stage for Redner, rubber rafin and drunkenas.</seg>
<seg id="617">MPs Flavio Serafini, Social and Peace Party (PSOL), asked the police via loudspeaker announcements to violence against demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="618">This also includes a report in Folha de S. Paulo, one of the oldest newspapers in the whole country.</seg>
<seg id="619">Once again the Brazilian media street protests, by putting the focus on another, unexpected protagonists: a window disc.</seg>
<seg id="620">The following ha de S. Paulo and estado de S. Paulo reported specifically for a broken glass window to illustrate with a picture of the cover sides.</seg>
<seg id="621">On the other hand, the O Globo preferred a title story with a fire on fire.</seg>
<seg id="622">There is no plausible journalistic reason, more about a broken window disc than the protests of thousands of people who serve as a special cause to report.</seg>
<seg id="623">This must also be seen, if you stripped against any form of atomic damage.</seg>
<seg id="624">Here, the term "Vandalism" is an absurd, disproportionate importance, and the typical violence of the military police are dispatched by demonstrators with the title "demonstrators on confrontation course with the police."</seg>

<seg id="628">It is two years ago when the activities were produced in the sugar cane mills.</seg>
<seg id="629">After the necessity of the sugar cane industry in the region, and the factory lost after and after its plants, until only the rumor made of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to invent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changes the work.</seg>

<seg id="635">That was something that he was not expected.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene reminds us exactly, that in MañalI won the sugar cane sugar, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar tubing industry is already using the plagues, the case of socialism, low market prices, the poor efficiency, and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016, the production was 1.6 million tons of sugar, less than 1910 produced.</seg>
<seg id="639">The message would have been some decades ago as a motive for the rest of the country, but the bad ones have already been a lot more.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar industry switched off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old railway platform of the congregation already looked better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of the sugar tube industry was an economical necessity: the 155 sugar cane mills were technically demanding, and hardly competitive were they insufficient for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to concentrate on the most efficient factories, the annual production target was 4 million tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="645">Only the factories are left to produce sugar for maximum 4 Centavos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives that lead to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the rise rise in the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless, the sugar price increased from about one decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugar will remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the report published by the OECD, the OECD, Food and Food Organization of the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current production would achieve the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), the raw sugar would generate about $85 million for the country.</seg>

<seg id="654">In the following years the nursing of 98 sugar cane factories came to more than 65 million persons received their full salaries for continuing education.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same thing happened in the sugar tube factory Gregorio Arlée Mañali on 14 May 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto Pérez worked in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">If Nene, as he is known as a soldier, talking about the closure of the factory, the Word, which he repeatedly, "scam."</seg>
<seg id="658">Nearly all respondents are of the same opinion, not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order to get the place, they formed a full-time working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the first break year, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">It was an official documents that were registered only concerning the parts that would be removed, the address sat and the date distinguished.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Ultimo Rosales del Toro, only the minister could approve any withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="663">Then the responsibility has been transferred from there and the letters were more common.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for the set-set factory for two years, and he was one who received the letters. "the country had no money for the unused sugar tube factory."</seg>

<seg id="675">When the sugar tube factory lock, or better, when they began to run them, they heard also to asphalve the streets, this disadvantageous to include other establishments.</seg>
<seg id="676">Without work in the region, and with advanced ages, Nene and Eddy had to search for other factories.</seg>
<seg id="677">They became a spare parts.</seg>

<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos, in which the young people are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia. they were invited to organise similar workshops with the trunk of Winnebago in the U.S. state of Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">For example, this video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak'yoo is told in the area of the tribe of the Kitsumkalum First Nation in British Columbia, called "Highway 16," which nearly two dozen were mostly indigenous young women or murdered.</seg>

<seg id="719">In order to show potential customers what exactly is on the menu, close to the entrance shokuhin sanu (law-by-faith, "plastic models of dishes") are issued by every food that is served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">The customers see these plastic dishes and decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the Kappabashi district of Kappabashi, there are a multitude of these small companies that produce those plastic filmmaker Wim Wenders in his film Tokyo Ga in front of more than 20 years ago.</seg>

<seg id="727">Here are some Shoes eatmagnets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom in essence is increasingly more complex.</seg>

<seg id="736">On Twitter some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"" "there is someone who say," "" "Wow, cool, now I can enchant my mobile with salmon?" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="785">No, it is not normal that my 10-year-old cousin already considering that he is big. and it is not normal that people listening to the "helplaten" of the offenders, when they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me, it is that, as if they have lost those who lost anybody and those who are afraid to have something really happened.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness, if stories are too bloc numbers in a statistic.</seg>

<seg id="799">The journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega published the article "The Forgotten Children of Ciudad Juárez: a generation by violence."</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction he raises questions on how: who cares for the child of a missed woman and a man who was murdered by organised crimes?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow up in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age, whose parents take care of them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is a fatherless and he tells us how to make an egg cooks, potatoes, tortillas warm and "Chichi" for the babies that are with him. this is his name for the preparation of bottle with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant in comparison to the pain in his eyes - unspeakable to a boy for all the life of violence, who had to learn to live thereby.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, she said to him that his mother had disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day that ended his childhood.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood was over two years earlier, when he was only a few blocks away from his home, the bloody Leiche of his father, who was shot by armed men from a previous car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation was seen in Juárez:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 as a violent crime against organized crime and war with the already existing social problems in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010 Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world, due to the number of murder, according to the Federal Council for Public Safety and Government of the United States government.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone the Prosecution filed 3103 Morde. this corresponds to an average of 8.5 Morning per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few hundred thousand stories which leaves the organized crime in Mexico and penetrate it into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only few stories live in view of always new headlines. this project reminds us of those who are not allowed to forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco," the data journalism project has launched in 2015, whose goal is to display complex information behind the drug trafficking in drug trafficking, the country in the past four decades, in an comprehensible way.</seg>

<seg id="820">Let us take this photo of a terrible accident in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo) seven years ago.</seg>

<seg id="823">But there should have questions about our desire to look at news.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010, a tank-car crossed the place Sange in the east of the DR Congo, tiled and exploded. in addition, 230 people were killed.</seg>

<seg id="842">Many were zousted, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">Only from using satellite imagery, the following time could be visually displayed.</seg>
<seg id="844">The reason for the attack remained unsolved, but the army's army at Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigerias and trying to win the Boko Haram to win country (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture emerges from the DR Kongo on, when it was evident as proof of the fact and the possible degree of attack was presented:</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place in Paris two days.</seg>

<seg id="917">United States, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="918">The picture was witched as a cover for the massacre of Boko Haram 2015 (and more than 9.300 times). but the messages that were connected with it were not taken in any religious context.</seg>
<seg id="919">Instead, the goal was to judge attention to the relative number of the deaths and a comparison of media coverage compared with Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Hebdo.</seg>

<seg id="931">Religion is important to understand and the value of human life is essential. therefore it's worth to investigate how images are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>

<seg id="1136">Can there be an option to occur here and now despite a language barrier using someone?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the "Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS) is a chance of stories in their original language a possible response.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported some more recently about a different initiative by Steven Bird, the unbearable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, the focus of TLS is not on the written, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and memorable the language variety of great cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">Indeed, urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oakland has been in the United States where TLS has already carried out since 2015 events, the risk that small and not quite as small languages are not admitted to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the makers of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass mortality of the world can be avoided when we create cities that accept diversity - safe spaces, in which inhabitants are not forgotten, who they are to be attributed to.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "while" "" "hearing" "" "listening to understand" "" "these events instead" "" "to hear, feel" "" "to feel" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, storytellers choose their history at first in their own language and translate or explain it in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are not professional storytellers, their devotion therefore lead to their devotion, and their presentation that the audience should be prevented.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They call laughter and emotions, when the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">For example, the following video shows a traditional story from Burkina Faso, which is told in the language Dafing. during this round, the storyteller Rassidatou does also take the opportunity to explain their country's typical customs of art.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event John Nyamusara tells the move from the bunny and the avian in speech Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">After having declared the importance of his Fak, John Nyamusara is asked: "how is this to say to an audience what your language does not understand?" with a wide Grinsen he divides his feeling of incomprehensivity:</seg>
<seg id="1150">They have heard!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were all with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">So far, the Events of Treasure Language Storytelling held in three cities, and the organizers hope to expand this. all those who are inspired by the project can come into contact with TLS in order to organize their own storytellers.</seg>

<seg id="1255">In 1990, Mosambique responded with anger on a corruption of corruption in which a government member returned to the workplace in the state of government, which corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">This includes Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and together with four other accused counts of 54 million metical (roughly 800 000 Euro) for 22 years in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money was from public funds in the airports of Mozambique, whose council is a member of Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 for good leadership and immediately requested his return to the company, what happened on April 19.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with the Procurator's Office of the Republic that uses the motion for Cambaza, there was not an obstacle course for Cambaza, to return to his old post as the company was not disciplined after his detention.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many inhabitants don't have the promotion.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Budade Pública, shortly CIP), a local institution that sets up for public transparency, condemned the decision to relocate the company's decision in an interview with the Deutsche Welle.</seg>
<seg id="1262">Provides a setback against corruption and clarifies the lack of transparency and is even a step in regard to the efforts of our legal system, so the CIP.</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we are aware of it is that the company should have a disciplines of disciplines against the conflicting might.</seg>
<seg id="1264">The company was silent, however, induced a reasonable legal steps for the application of the respective functions.</seg>

<seg id="1266">When Cambaza was a competent type, it would be consultant after being condemned to a prison sentence and of which the half has been sent.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could have paid talks and motivating speeches, he could advise and his image editing.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent, he has distilled to be reintegrated into the company which he helped to add damage.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore it is obvious: Cambaza is paid for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Revocation!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil says the director does not occupy no morals:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza was rewarded by the state because he did not believe him, because someone claims to reward someone this in such way that has already been solid to the state.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza is missing to return to Moral and serve to serve the state, * he already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead it has only served on the state instead.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza, the state, used as a handsome of an inexhaustible money source and the state itself, this man was tired, who was summoned and finally convicted to a long sentence.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly I don't know why this man was rewarded.</seg>

<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that is usually used by ultra-nationalists than hate crimes against Muslims who constitute a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>

<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China, such as Sina Weibo and Wechat, have demonstrated that the users are often going to start on social networks, a new word or an alternative writing of the words to express their views.</seg>

<seg id="1353">But at the beginning of 2017, the bill was decided by the child before - despite 4 senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent, which enthroned into the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him a law.</seg>
<seg id="1354">Now only the president of the country must vote and declare the law.</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the country's representative one issued on Facebook a status update which Leslie-Ann Boiselle on Instagram has again posted:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr. Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill against child before was decided in the House of Representatives, with 35 votes and no one decided.</seg>
<seg id="1357">After having previously decided in the Senate, the draft may now become a law.</seg>

<seg id="1360">It has too much time and unnecessary decks, which has veiled the core of the thing, but do you know what? the child before is in Trinidad and Tobago now illegal, and this is almost every prize.</seg>

<seg id="1376">Prior to months, Maharaj announced his intention to conduct judicial steps, should enact the law, and he seems to redeem his promise.</seg>
<seg id="1377">During the Attorney Paris Al rawi, a supporter of the law, said it be justified if Maharaj would like to make sure most social media users would like to deal with the discussion on the subject.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Worrell struck him:</seg>
<seg id="1379">Rather, Sat, if we call, instead of discussing the discussion as general, in a way that we could speak instead of the problem that we may protect the state in our bedroom, that it may be used by large, hard-hard men who are opposed to them, "would you be ready to continue the discussion?</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you believe it is not a problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">But if there is no more important step against the law or not, this legislation is an important step - however there are still places in the world where the children are legal in different gradations, or still the norm although there are laws, which they say.</seg>

<seg id="1417">Sascha Giri was with the photos that he looked around, never satisfied. they were blended with poorly positioned motives and balanced colors.</seg>
<seg id="1418">That motivated him to wear a camera with themselves and try to grab the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">He was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, SUSS is trying to bring Nepals, Nepals wildlife to the international stage.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And its hometown right next to Chitwan National Park, it offers the perfect opportunity to shoot photos, which guides the attention on Neptune's wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">In Facebook, he described this first class on Facebook as it helps to help him:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could it better give for a passionate game of wildlife!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I felt right at home when I suddenly called Navaraj (the manager of Chitwan Gaida Lodge). he had a call of my father, that it would be a leopard on the bank of the Rapti river.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river damm is only a few minutes away from the tourist village Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I went on with my camera and was there in few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river, where the Leopard was side and I immediately started to kneeling pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sascha aims to obtain a collaboration with the authorities to obtain worldwide recognition for Nepals nature and would like to understand the understanding that the animals are not as furious, as they look like.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know it; because he arose from face to face to face, saying,</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger can't disturb itself from the opinion of sheep at bedtime!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleeping time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">Also, because of darkness, on the way back home, when suddenly the king of the bush appeared immediately. it immediately sets us, we see and starred me through the Sal-trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals, SUSS placed the logo "I click for Conservation (lit.: I clicked for Environmental Protection) on his Photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">But its passion for the promotion of Nepals nature and game is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days, and lived there mostly in a tent to take in the Bardia National Park recordings of Otters. up to 12 days, until he could photograph a tiger and live six to seven days for perfect photo of birds, which live near the tourist accommodation.</seg>

<seg id="1470">A revised version was re-released as part of a Content Sharing Convention.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India there are women with greatest care, names of their husbands or even by older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead, they use a Pronomic or saying "father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chuisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh give women to respect them because of the social pressure of the husband, as well as fear of the consequences, they should violate the norm in order to live this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year Malati Mahatoto was condemned by a pseudo-chamber by the Indian state and chased out of her family and the community, after having called a married relatives with names.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of tradition did not call their wives, as well as among men, however, they have far more adherents to fear, if at all, they should not follow this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health staff as well as household stuff, a unique club, and were thus fast to the main focus of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is only one place only for them only to discuss and discuss the hostile of the Patriarchal.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of 56 clubs, which is in 13 Indian states, it is part of the campaign # Khelbadal, which is operated by the community Video Volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Paelworks has been working with the help of their video camera for the discovery of practitioners, such as children's marriage to the association of HIV- and AIDS-Independents, and manages that club.</seg>
<seg id="1480">It reports about it, as these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time they have made at the ambassadors of the change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video, the Rohini showed in its discussion round, traded women in their husbands did not call their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1482">It has opted for this topic, because they wanted to open the conversation about the Patriarchate with a problem with which the women can identify themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1483">To address the names of their husbands, there is a broader, which they have pleaded not guilty to all duties and have never been questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini said:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testified that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not keep this, is considered a vist, as woman without Moral.</seg>
<seg id="1487">Tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never made us up to this discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini wanted to try her husband, so far as previously called in the name, try out at home, as it runs.</seg>
<seg id="1489">They showed the video of the discussion round about her husband and mother-in-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini told:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother in law and my husband still weigh long after the video was at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"" "Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said," "" "I should call it from now on his name." ""</seg>
<seg id="1493">Rohini started her first discussion with this self-confidence in the Baggage.</seg>
<seg id="1494">"" "many women had never heard the word" "" "Patriarchate" "". "some believed that it was a good thing, because it meant the younger members of a family, especially girls and women." ""</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the videoprojection, the women tried to bring discussion with an exercise in motion.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked any participant in the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, offended, sad, loving and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">"" "then she asked all," "" "If we cannot tell the name of our husbands, but to call us as they can, that they may not respect us?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equal? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years, and this was the first day when she brought the name of her husbands on the lips," says Rohini Pabrash in Maharashtra over the Brechen of a Year of centuries, in which women married the names of their husbands ever.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini told:</seg>
<seg id="1502">"" "" "" "a woman was so shy that she was just outside the whole exercise; a different one decided to escape the whole frustration against him and his family, taking him cursed." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1503">Expression in their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think it will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Still in the Adrenalinfrenzy, with an ancient bridge broke, the women decided that they could really try to call her husbands in the name.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next few days Rohini received a number of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini, and asked what ideas she sat in the head: his wife could not stop his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it with dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law stripped, she was afraid, saying that there was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">"" "another woman said," "" "Rohini said, I should do it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understandable and the situation was arted in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports, such as women tried to stop other practices such as carrying the zinnored points on the forehead that shows the Eheststatus:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why must only women show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband that I would bear the zinnored point when he would like it.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only and I listened to him to carry him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women did not hear completely, but they think that they are now in a better position, even to choose him in some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the discussion skeb is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"we are doing an excursion on every discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "I don't want to take care of women who could hear what" "" "says it." ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">During the last months, they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes, and they danced and spoke about things about which they had never made thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini said:</seg>
<seg id="1524">"" "" "" "I have been working on these problems for so many years, such as our identities are linked to our husbands, never as honest." ""</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feel great to say that certain things can tell you, no matter how small it occurs.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In discussion round, we have underneath the concept of honor and it is connected to clothing.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only been borne by Saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most of them is okay, but some wanted to bear a Salma-Kurta, a wide shirt above a pants; they did not clothe.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After much argument and discussion about the advantages of your own hanger, the Moral connected with the Saris and much more, tasted cruini their own pairs of Kurtas (Oberhemden) into a discussion round, so that women could bear them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next, they now have decided to plan a trip to Goa, where they can wear Jeans and Rohini is sure that they will be able to create it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">At the question, whether in the five months since their first discussion has been somewhat changed, Rohini confirms that things slowly come into the rolls:</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have made only small steps.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a few times, but then heard again to say the name of her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some of them included, do it still, but only if they are alone and no other family members are present.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Just one or two would continue to say the names of her husbands; only one or two women now wear Zinnoberred at their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in discussion will know that the changes that they want to achieve in their lives - as the line for more movement or their own hangers - at the end of a difficult to navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">"" "" "" "having confidence in mutually confidence, will be aware of them in the same boat." ""</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Every one of us is a sacrifice of patriarchal.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am so too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club shows all of us the confidence that change something.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it will not only be limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction, if any woman deals in the club in the club and other people, what we speak and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or a country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may be dumm, since Singapore is recognized as an independent state as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the minister of Justice, K. Shanmugam should be considered city as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the association of the State of New York, the Minister noted that many people had criticised the dominance of the only political party of Singapore as compared to Singapore with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">It understands that Singapore should be considered as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one has asked if New York is a democracy...</seg>

<seg id="1691">I tried to explain that we are different.</seg>

<seg id="1695">And then, according to all our efforts and offerings to create this valuable country, we will say that we finally are no country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It was so vulgar, it had the calls of a escape before the responsibilities, a breach of obligations.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you're not my country, whose land is it?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons mentioned by Shanmugam were not a Nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', in view of what, it appeared unconstitutional.</seg>
<seg id="1699">In contrast, he defends the idea that Singapore should be compared to Chicago, San Francisco or New York cities, equally the cities that are led permanently by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Once you reach the core point of the theme, the good old Leier of the authorized providers of seizure are going to be democratic logic, because they are better fit in their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the final effect the answers were given in the last week by Shanmugam to his American guests with our press, our Judiciative, of our political system really non-responses.</seg>
<seg id="1703">Corresponding questions tared with non-responsive manner.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng requires Shanmugam to illustrate his opinion, because they did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country, but a city that is to which country belongs to our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I do not understand.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very thankful when our new K Shanmugam would take the trouble to clarify this point, if he was high, to be part of the government of the City of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By clicking on the blog he published his comment on the reviews that you should begin to read the entire address of the Conference, in order to understand the context of the statements of Shanmugam, according to that Singapore is a city and there is no country.</seg>

<seg id="1716">At least I knew Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old Garde, which expects me to agree with them or not, but this is a different thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, member of the new generation of the political leader of Singapore, I doubt and I'm not even sure whether he is really associated, and aware of what he defended.</seg>

<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tapachula, located at the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is directed by a 59- year-old Mexican woman, a small woman with a coral-pink Brillenframe and golden slings in teddy billets.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called Concepción González Ramírez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. however, they know many under the name Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is the fact that the hotel (or rather she itself) has become a goal for Africans and Haitians, who are on the passage.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about $2.50 per night the guests sleep in simple rooms, with grinding, crumbled walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the entrance room there is a parrots in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - nevertheless, hundreds of African and haitian migrants are here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, Ms. Ramírez told the people in full little busses and from the upper part of the coast to call: "Mama Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you my mother of Africa? "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At the moment it is rather quiet but in this year Ramírez has already received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>

<seg id="1926">He tells us that Haitians and Afrikaner would often travel together the track and that Afrikaner would speak to WhatsApp from Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">As many of its signatories, Michelet previously lived in Brazil and worked as a construction worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy was weaker, he started his journey into the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He's been a guest of Mama Africa since months: it sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>

<seg id="1936">The other end of the city leads a blind alley to Jesús Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">In this winter, Valenzuela and his family was included in their small house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is policeman and has found that the bus tickets are sold to numerous African migrants.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He began to help them to get a reasonable price, then he gave them his house for one dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment 25 people are there, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleeping on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking place outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests do.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I have lived in the United States," he says. "I experienced what they experience.</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border via the desert and we suffered.</seg>

<seg id="1961">The residents of Xinjiang, an ethnic minorities region in the west of China, are compelled to install a Spyware on your mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On 10 July, the mobile phone users received a mobile phone notification in the Tianshan district of Urumqi, in which it exhibits the District Government to install an monitoring app named Jingwang (or "Web-cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "in the announcement, it is said that the app" "" "will make access to terrorist information" "". "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1966">In the notification of the police, the app changes the sources and the distribution paths of the terrorists, along with "illegal religious" activities and "harmful information," including videos, images, ebooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is the blocking pornographic websites, from online guile, troupe and Phishing pages to make users attentive to users, how much time they spend online, and remote control of your own home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with filters for minors is to help the children to develop healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these features can be used in various ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote" state "state" or even hacker, could manipulating the home network of any person or steal out of it.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is consistent with other measures to control the digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While messages about digital censorship in China are mostly concentrated on the experiences of users in the major cities of the East and south, reality is very often dim for those who live in remote, oppressed ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">To limit unrest and dissatisfaction in conflict areas, authorities are often arrange extreme censors and monitoring measures, as well as routinely internet switching.</seg>
<seg id="1976">The media-based media Outlet "Images from" China "(Genuine quality), the censored news in China, showed photos from a Checkpoint when policemen had the inhabitants randomly damaged, whether they had installed the monitoring app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian ensure that people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification demanded that people install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you find at a Checkpoint using a device without these software, it could be imprisoned for up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They forced people to use devices that are intended for elderly people.</seg>

<seg id="1985">After installation of Jingwang computer and mobile phones in Xinjiang are electronic handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">In Jingwang, there may be a reaction to the instructions of the city council, to minimize the dissemination of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government branches, authorities and associated facilities, including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity Office when running their computer and communication equipment.</seg>

<seg id="2065">His command is to rip so much flesh as possible from the body.</seg>
<seg id="2066">He calls the lovingly "confession."</seg>
<seg id="2067">It starts with a plastic pipe, which probably comes from the cloak.</seg>
<seg id="2068">Your hen rejoiceth to your cry.</seg>
<seg id="2069">Give him the pleasure, you can't measure you and you can't restop your terrors.</seg>
<seg id="2070">My cry were not enough, so they are not enough, so they interchangeable it through a cable.</seg>
<seg id="2071">During my first arrest I asked if the investigator had worked earlier times as a garbage collection or until it belonged to normal working equipment.</seg>
<seg id="2072">They had four cables attached to each other in order to present us from their viewpoint, great invention of a huge cable.</seg>
<seg id="2073">Three of them in one hour, three of them, while I was still in the series.</seg>
<seg id="2074">I had lost all feeling in my body - and also my voice, why I listened to cry.</seg>
<seg id="2075">The hen noticed the cooling down and didn't feel like a pleasure, so it is why it is neighbour to an electrically loaded staff.</seg>
<seg id="2076">Electricity flowed my whole body enough to supply my whole area.</seg>
<seg id="2077">My semi-cracker body, which was stretched out on the ground was the perfect current conductor.</seg>
<seg id="2078">The numbness disappeared and the pain was back again.</seg>
<seg id="2079">After two terrible hours he decided that he had filled his duty for this night.</seg>
<seg id="2080">It must have been at midnight.</seg>
<seg id="2081">I decided to sleep back again; let's say, that was my only option.</seg>
<seg id="2082">Some hours have been forcing, who arrived as minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Then the call to the morning prayer.</seg>
<seg id="2084">The door opens and the morning light meets the space ".Rout with you, Arschficker."</seg>

<seg id="2090">The Jordanian Rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of the LGBTQ + community, free expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">This photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib leaves the majority of its time in the town, and he slim to his screen, again to his computer, and again to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Why can you leave, there is a cigarette between his fingers or with nicotine undefiled lips.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the chief cornoss of his family house which had been one of them since 1967; and in which Israel had forced his occupation of the West Bank and Hdaibs family had forced to escape from their village in Palestine (about: farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years, Hdaib is an passionate active activist, the conservative majority are transferred to gender roles, sexuality and free expression over gender roles, sexuality and free expression by art and raping.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which deals with topics such as Oriental, racism and the situation of Palestinian skirmoth, but also calls for the core of the entire Arab world. all these topics will not only be found in cities, which from Damascus in Syria until the whole of Sanaa in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With his 25 years, Hdaib sees itself as a man whose thinking is not restricted by limits, and he can feel the devastating consequences of foreign intervention in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he doesn't open it, he stimulates the US's foreign policy an extraordinary baffection.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib is considered his art in Amman in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib believes not that his compassion for those who try to survive in warfare, anything with its identity as "Palestinian leader of the second generation," says himself, even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine so far.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think because of my own life," emphasises hdaib.</seg>
<seg id="2104">"" "then he adds:" "" "I think that," "" "I am a man," "" "while he poured out the nest of Nesadan in two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan. in this time it is intended for Muslims to fasten the sunrise until sundown." ""</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Apparently Hdaib has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee at a sensual hot fridays have little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically the pieces of warm coffee and the cockles of the Kent cigarette in the nose into first line of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes, Jordan feels like a prison under the free sky, especially when you raises a look into the neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Therefore it avoids simple to do basic things - as in the public during Ramadan to drink water - to land not in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, the Ministry of the Ministry of Jordan adopted a show in the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some parliamentary committee that support the Islamic Emirate - argued that the sexual orientation of the Muslim Brotherhood - Hamed Sinno, contradicted the cultural and traditional norms of the country and is the main reason for the concert.</seg>
<seg id="2112">"" "the members and former spokesman of the Islamic Coalition DIMA Tahboub said in an interview with CNN, that the concert" "" "just" "" "had been cancelled due to sexual orientation of the singer." ""</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many claim to claim the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab spring, human rights and free expression in the Arab world, is the dangerous activism that authorized the ancient of legitimacy of authoritarian regimes in the entire region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou'Leila came to the jordanian people as "progressive supporters of human rights," which continued to continue to use an intellectual and cultural pluralism. "</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement is probably not just a silky rhetoric, but actually an evident upheaval reality in Jordan is clearly reflected in Hdaib work.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In the year 2016, Hdaib traditional Gender norms struck by his vision of the fate of Arabic women that convoke sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of a obviously adorned woman, whose arms and legs appear to the corners of the screen.</seg>
<seg id="2118">She is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of innumerable women who have lost their lives by the hands of those who actually should trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">In the past few years, the number of 'honorary mordium' has increased - the unofficial outside was left.</seg>
<seg id="2120">According to Human Rights Watch, the number of Honor in 2016 reached its zenith; however the institutional infrastructure is still lack to support women who attempted to attempted murder or domestic violence against an appropriate way.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law on the overthrow of death in 1954, women who have been exposed to indefinite high-family treasures, "and for their release is often a year's bureaucratic expenditure as well as the guarantee of the family that the woman will happen nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Also Hdaib music enjoys great popularity and is known to repay them not as tabulated in his country for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib assert that his work is politically, but he dreamed that he's his music, the full of expeditions to sexuality, freedom and expression of expression, cannot be separated from politics.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man.</seg>
<seg id="2125">He became a policy of politics, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed," Hdaib takes the question after the Palestinian identity.</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and in "Ghareeb" will focus on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs which are politically active in the heart.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016, Hdaib published a song with the title "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song, a verse is often repeated:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is it."</seg>
<seg id="2132">In another course of the songs, Hdaib describes the world as a type market, in which one can get in his words, "what you want" - is faith or non-belief, heterogeneity or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He noticed that no one speaks in Jordan on the rights of gay men and lesbians, and that comments on the gender equality of LGBTQ + individuals were still censored in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular jordanian Onlineprogram Roya, to note later that his comments were torn from context, and in his opinion was censored.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"" "" "" "on Youtube, it was uploaded without cuts, but was only a revised version," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib advertises the Arab LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that intolerance against homosexuality does not disagree to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentioned Abu Nuvo, a poet of the eighth century, which still has remained in memory thanks to its homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks: if Abu Nuvo, who should work on behalf of the calibre, in the eighth century openly could write about homosexuality, why should Jordanian do not know?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled, to do.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashemian kingdom there is nothing new that the government attacks attacks on freedom of opinion and that progressive voices are led to silence.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian news service took several former government members and members of the lecturban on the grounds that they had expressed their problems with the deeply in the land root corruption.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of what's the show in Hdaib opinion, only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to be a structural change in the next generation of the Jordan.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him, Mashrou'Leila has now turned into a concert for the second time, but the way of progress - it looks well, deliberate and insignificant changes. it is sure that these changes will take place from day to day in the heart of the Jordanian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">In the last century, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, was also abroad of an Arab world without interventions.</seg>
<seg id="2145">He will not only dreams of it, his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to experience it. "</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps, the region will help the help of music, art, literature and literature, and not through bombs, streetunitions and on artificial sort of guided democracies. at least, he hopes it.</seg>
<seg id="2147">So far as far as far as far, Hdaib will continue to resist and also resist resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2148">This report was created by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, which Aman belongs as a student Fellow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the three biggest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">This big, extravagant wardolls are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Nebuta Festivals.</seg>
<seg id="2152">It is thought that there is a variant of the Tanabata festivals, which is usually considered in August in many opponents, the drums, and the tandem lasted more than one thousand years, to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the Emishi in the knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We were able to catch some great seats, therefore we have a great view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">One can hardly imagine hard, how large these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A joint centre in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, organised a two-month exhibition at Wa no Akari (littl).</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have been watching the Meguro Gajoen for a long time: two paws are straight to see.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nevertheless, for many people who take away the journey to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival is the only landmark - and a breathtaking way to spend his summer:</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>
<seg id="2160">Yattemare! "# summer festival in the north of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2161">I was there and I watched the # NebutaFestival.</seg>

<seg id="2167">Rarely, outer apparition and body care were as important as in this story, because they help to maintain the Peruvian youth from the crime and to promote a legitimate profession as the course of the hairdresser.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Perus most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, near the historical center of Lima, a region with a very high crime rate, where street children and illegal drugs are daily.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey, published in April 2017, showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region do not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time, Peru experiences Peru - how many other Central and South American countries - a rising demand for men for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, the appearance and therefore also the unusual hairstyles of famous sports athletes like Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Peru), gave himself more normal citizens into the experienced hands of hairdressing, which can produce these elaborate hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">An unprecedented demand for hairdos, which go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity, has even inspired an annual event, the competition of hairdressers "Batalla de Barberos" which has been taking place since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">There are experts from each other to show, who can see from them the eccentric leooks, as you can see in the following Video (other videos on current competition there are on public Facebook-profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions such as School Augusto Salazar Bondy, located in El Callao, found here an opportunity to exchanging young people, to exchange their weapons against hairdressing tools, which allows you to find work in the hairdresser of art, which allows them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and some possibilities, dozens of young people saw that they can take a job, currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">The school offered special apprenticeship workshops in the beginning of March and reported about some of their successes:</seg>
<seg id="2177">In 1995 we were the only specialist school in the municipality and the district, which we are very proud because of love to the children we have built this educational community.</seg>

<seg id="2181">"" "the following article is the revised version of the" "" "Liebesverbot on Guerilla fighters" "", "published the international online magazine Tea After Twelve." ""</seg>
<seg id="2182">The contribution is published here within a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we write little letters to people who we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not much more importantly, people who feel well-made?</seg>
<seg id="2185">Exactly this question was the two young colleague of Leonardo Párraga von der Foundation Bogotart and Cristian Palacios from the head and inspired them to the campaign cartas por la Reconciliación (letters for reconciliation), the young people exhort, guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Only recently, her country was called for a historical event, and they wanted to contribute to their part: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government had closed a peace treaty with the guerrilla movement FARC (German: revolutionary forces of Colombia), which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">International applied the signatories of the peace agreement as an important that the Colombian President José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for its merits services.</seg>
<seg id="2188">But before the column, however, there is still a long way until one can speak of a real conciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla struggles, who lived for many years in illegitimate camps, were subjected to a prisoner of war crimes and contributed around the clock their weapons with themselves, to integrate them into life as civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">"" "" "" "the Colombian company again struggling to life in perpetual fear and in some cases were used to absorb guerrilla fighters" "" "and they must support this in its rows and support them in creating a new life." ""</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian we convinced that young Columbus could join together and help the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And exactly what did they do: until now, thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former guerrilla fighters to welcome them again in the company.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for every former guerrilla fighting - which then should be handed over to personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The Valentine's Day as inspiration for the Campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for reconciliation was created on the World Summit of the Nobel Peace Laureates that took place in Bogotá in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to speak shortly with Kailash Satyarthi, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">"" "" "" "this declared that we love to write on the day of thousands of love letters, but those that need them much more necessary." ""</seg>
<seg id="2197">"" "he reads, he told his love to share his love with people who needed the most urgent show." ""</seg>
<seg id="2198">So, the plan was made to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC. "the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a war history to a common history of peace," they say.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Until now, more than 2000 letters were collected during the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'I never would have thought that someone might forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over on March 19 in one of the UN camps in the Calendo Cauca region.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the city administration of Cali and Leonardo from the Foundation Bogotart traveled into the camp to get the letters personally.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC shown so, as they had done it earlier to accept the commands of their leader.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they did not receive orders, but letters full of subsubject from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for all involved. "it's incredible how many different feelings one can run in just a few hours - from anxiety to luck and everything that is between" says the political science student Manuela Jiménez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a member of the governor of the province of Valle del Cauca described this unforgettable experience as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After we had handed over the letters, a former fighters led me by the camp of guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">"" "when I saw in one of the" "" "CamBook" "" "(a kind of cottage, where the guerrilla fighting live), I saw a guerrilla fighting who wrote something." ""</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to enter, because in addition to him on bed the MGL-Granatwerfer, a deadly weapon in the village of thorn.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "I said to him," "" "Hello, what do they just do?" "" "he answered," "" "I am answering a letter which someone has written to me." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Never before me in my life has something so nice, I am thinking about it. and suddenly I left the tears over the cheeks.</seg>
<seg id="2214">I embraced him, and set me beside the pomegranates.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was sorry for the war, I was sorry for all the years of loyal efforts of this fighting, and would help him to write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he never had something different from life as war. he had never thought to preserve him and his six brothers before the hunger strike. "I would never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">"" "but now I know that there is a company without an open poor." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now I have learned, how I have to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">"" "but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and do in dignity" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">Students and some leader of the FARC joined a discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="2222">They were all grew up as early as war and the FARC already revealed in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">Therefore, the leader of the FARC declared the history of the organization, their ideals and gave insight into their views over the peace process. "for many years, we experienced the opportunity to develop us to a political party, we can help us to design the society in this country.</seg>
<seg id="2224">"" "for a target of these orders, it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles," "" "said one of them." ""</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">"" "" "" "these people have never found hearing, and had no electoral right yet, and to know that people who had often been seen as a monster, and they even turned around with beautiful emotions, which were surrounded by their lives and environment, was very painful for me." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality, where the land lives, does my hurt to me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">"" "" "" "but it comfort me that all men - even those who have killed and so much harm has done to give us something, and a smile and a hug can give us." ""</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have answered the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo González, the commander of the camp in Caldono Cauca, wrote for instance Darío de Jesús Monsalve, Archbishop of the city of Cali, following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The column was made, that after deforestation peace would reign peace.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not true.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as it is inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment possibilities, there will always be people who are ready to hold to arms, and to protest to their rights. and that's also entirely justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">We now rely on the FARC now in peace, on a policy without weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call all the defenders of peace - no matter what breed, religion or ideology - to rise over all those who dream of a country in war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, afford our contribution and offer sacrifice, because we know from my own experience, that nothing is simple. those among us who defend the life as the basis of existence, many difficulties are imminent.</seg>
<seg id="2237">On our way, there will be many obstacles, but we will overcome them together.</seg>

<seg id="2406">He died short time later.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide that has happened in August within the Arab Ahwazi minority, and activists appear before the spot that even more men could take life.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights asked that this month some other - Hamid Manifestat, Ali Hazbawi, Ali Hazbawi, Ali Hazbawi, Sayyed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have a thing in common: there were all family-fathers, who were based on persecution by the Iranian government, helpless and immorable to keep their families to live and secure their work.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab Ahwazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region, which is based on the majority of the Arab Ahwazi community in Iran, was shaken by a profound economic crisis which makes it difficult to contest her living in the domestic Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2412">Before a century, the Arab bewaz was a predominantly independent region in Iran, until the Pahlavi-monarchy took power and took over in 1925 great efforts to finish ethnic autonomy in the whole Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahwaz region, there are some of the biggest in Iran's largest oil and gas fields as well as some of the richest and most valuable areas for the Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite these precious resources, the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the native population gets a little bit of this wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often victims of untreated diseases, hunger and emptying.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime is refusing the ancestors of the ancestors of the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government has also built a variety of demmen, the water of the Arabic territories into the Persian areas where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom are redirect.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These manifestations have led me to destroy those in the region by dryness, devastation, local farming as well as the fish and palm-industry.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab Ahawzi-adolescents now increased to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian General Director of cooperation, work and social welfare, noted that 5% of the ancestor who had a work completed primary school, 55% have completed a secondary school and 45% have completed a university degree.</seg>

<seg id="2423">Keni Keni said that particularly the unemployment remains worse than worse. reason for this, a combination of a high number of Ahwaz went to ethnic Persians and an anti-Arab discrimination in the constellations process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">Since officials and institutions are not preferred for the Arab labour, the local Arab Ahwazi will resume access to work opportunities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">That is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their lives outside their country Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to change their benefits and surnames, in order to hide their citizenship to the ancestor, since the Arab names are not tolerated, because speaking the Arab language, or the Tragen Arab clothes.</seg>

<seg id="2436">They can be read in the comments under the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">If I say that I'm not a feminist, react many women - especially the white women who can designate themselves as intersectionaries of feminists - with frustration.</seg>
<seg id="2438">You wonder why I am not part of movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">She even thought good and well thought scientific and social arguments against me why I should be a feminist and why we generally should all feminist *.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, women today still earn less money for men in spite of equal education.</seg>
<seg id="2441">"" "" "" "that women still are still under strict observation, if it comes to work with their bodies." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social standards are still ensuring that women sojourn or later in various areas of life to a glacne ceiling, and that discrimination based on gender is still across many different countries and beliefs.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All this is aware and known.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced of it and I suffer twice and triple them.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet, if I speak on skin colour, on black cis women, on black women in the LGBTIQ church or on black women from the Diaspora; if I mention, on which kind of feminist movement, many white feminists and white intersectional feminists were to be silent.</seg>
<seg id="2448">However, they all agree that women - all women - together should come together to sing "their voices, to sing" Kumbaya, my lord "to sing the equality (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they don't want to speak to sexual violence a institutionalised form of assimilated violence, which are exposed to black women on two times.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or in that, black women and women are less deserving as white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls with a migration background to the school are respected as white girls, due to apparent integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">"" "" "" "or that women in black spans and women with migration background to a higher risk have been subjected to domestic violence and violence in the partnership as white women." ""</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the other hand, I wish that all men, all men, and all human beings have either a movement, in whose center the white woman stands, who refused to take account of unmistakes in their thinking which refer to both gender as well as the skin colour of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I'm exhausted and become no more about my citizenship in a white-feminist orientated sphere, killing me and innumerable other black women always and again rejected.</seg>
<seg id="2455">In 1851, Soil filed a speech in 1851, saying, "Am I not a wife?" and I also refused to maintain a ideology in which the black woman has a significant and marginal nature.</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refresh me to join me groupings, which also assimilate through cultural enrichment of our customs and customs to drive its egocentric program.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will no longer try to grow white women the importance of the overthroat of skin colour and sex almost. some of them will continue their significance in black women for feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to revive them.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although intersectionial Feminism was founded to give women's home to a home and turn from the white feminism, still the word "feminism" in its name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I take it to dissolve my full and whole of feminism, which was called for my dark skin and my status as wife, rather than for a white feminist paradigm, that is very persistent that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now, it is more important than ever before we define our own ideas towards us and we will help us to give us to our own ideas that we will be created for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the Book Africana regenism (about: Africa-Womanism: how we can defend ourselves to defend our own kind, in which they can defend ourselves in this way into which the cultural, spiritual, secular, physical and even the spiritual elements can be encouraged.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectionate feminists immediately refer to separatism and exclusion after they have read these lines, please inform yourself about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of feminist movement, of which the black woman is affected.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a bluristic environment I can lift up black women and women of other cultures, because in this paradigm exist.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I will be recognized as part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and because of my existence.</seg>
<seg id="2465">I, a black woman, can flourish in a environment, in which my life has no overlap, nor are ignored, nor denied.</seg>

<seg id="2547">More than one year ago, the omic authorities have closed the independent Arab newspaper Azamn due to their reporting on corruption in the Sultant.</seg>
<seg id="2548">Yousef Al-Haj, one of the editors of the newspaper, continues to be in prison, where he was a prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2549">Two other editors of Azamn, Ibrahim Al-Maamari, and Zahir Al-Abri, were also arrested and returned to court but later came back.</seg>
<seg id="2550">Oman has been ruled by Sultan Qabus ibn Said since 1970, who came to power after he had lost his father, Said ibn Taimur, by a state of jurisdiction.</seg>
<seg id="2551">Since then, he suffers from his role as the only Sultan, the most important offices in the country: Prime Minister, Minister of Defence, Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, Finance, Foreign Affairs, Chairman of the Supreme Council for the planning and president of the Central Bank.</seg>
<seg id="2552">The Sultan's rule is characterized by the harassing efforts of security forces, particularly of domestic violence, including freedom of freedom, including press freedom, independent journalist, blogger and other activists.</seg>
<seg id="2553">The authorities restrict peaceful and legitimate activities in human rights, systematically, activists, their views over the public affairs of the country such as corruption in authorities and institutions in both online and offline.</seg>
<seg id="2554">The attack on the newspaper Azamn, its closure and the arrest of three of their editors in the last year is a hard blow for the press freedom in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2555">Azamn is an independent newspaper, which has been reported on corruption in Oman (a absolute monarchy) since its inception in 2007, until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016.</seg>

<seg id="2569">On 22 August 2016, Al-Abri was appointed a security deposit of 5000 Iberian Rial (13000 US dollars) and he was released from prison on 22 August 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2570">At a hearing on 26 December 2016 at a hearing on 26 December 2016, Al-Haj sentenced to six months "imprisonment for Al-Haj.</seg>

<seg id="2578">Due to the ongoing closure of Azamn and the arrest of journalist Al-Haj, the impression is that the omic authorities are still not willing to prepare an end for the extensive violation of the press freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2579">The Gulf Centre for Human Rights (Gulf Centre for Human Rights, GCHR) demands the omic authorities on:</seg>
<seg id="2580">1. Yousef Al-Haj moved immediately and unconditionally release;</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, figure out with his understanding</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is only rarely or not mentioned in the media. this is the growing area that addresses the most urgent matter of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">For the need for medical research there are two reasons: for a lack of global healthcare, many medicines and vaccines that cover the special medical requirements on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have significant effects in the poorest countries in Africa than elsewhere, and lack of investments for the investigation of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies are a big problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Secondly, research, which is carried out by African scientists in Africa, has its own research capacities in Africa. a larger role of science and technology can only be eligible for the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is director of the Centre for Infectious diseases in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew in the 1990s in Lusaka, Zambia, just as the AIDS epidemic was the first gradient to national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for studying in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">When Postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he researched even on HIV-virus before he decided to go back home to support the samic health system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and beyond this research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(Disclaimer: Dr. Warrier speaks to a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment, the focus is on the application of research results. in this process, I support the samic national program for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">I just starved a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">Gv: what are your opinion about the important current scientific topics in your country and general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How are they different from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no basic research here. we only have solutions to have been developed somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="2604">That must change, otherwise we will always remain the receiver instead of himself Macher.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions that we get, are often usable in our surroundings, and sometimes it is impossible to use them here.</seg>
<seg id="2606">Gv: where does financing and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it enough?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How easy or difficult, to find suitable scientists for projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are funded differently well.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who want to return or to come here, because funding and development chances are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Gv: how is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What obstacles are there in your routine research work that you didn't had before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: basic infrastructure does not comply with standards in developed countries. it costs much money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory materials is expensive, and it takes months to import them from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">Gv: how is the public opinion about Science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there are already interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would propose that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Gv: as large, in your opinion, according to the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should it concentrate, and how can we assist development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I've seen great students of all age groups.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There are need of special scientific training, starting at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer science, big data, research of space, health care (non-transferable and contagious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine are benefiting from it.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Gv: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as scientists in Africa against Western countries, based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often there are the limited speed, things to do, and the equivalent values to scientific expertise, which represent the challenges.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The system that magazines are only accessible against payment (the so-called "Paywall"), also limits the amount of available information and speed of research.</seg>

<seg id="2628">This post of Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website Ensia.com, a magazine published on solutions for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been bred already since the 1980s in the USA salad.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company offers 114 varieties, such as Outreddish, the first plant, which was added from NASA's astronauts in space, and has been consumed.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years, mortal work was given only by its own offence and the question, how many ointments can he get limits.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000s, he noticed that more salads were patented, and that he could not only use them for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents are not only for individual varieties but also for certain properties like resistance to diseases, a special red or green or green leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the past few years, more such patents have been registered for more plants such as cereal or cartottoman. due to this trends, plant breeding, environmentalists and experts have taken care of food safety in the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representatives of millennia-millennia tradition, Morton is still a salad, he needs to be longer, because his work will always be more constracted with always more constraints.</seg>

<seg id="2639">However, however, he is very careful and endeavoured to use any material that is protected as intellectual property.</seg>

<seg id="2643">It is not a coincidence that this name does rather sound so as the movement from the IT area would come and not from the area of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (Initiative for Open Source "seed) can be inspired by the movement for free" open source "software, providing alternatives to copyright protected software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was launched in order to ensure that some plant species and gens are not protected as intellectual property and are suitable for plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2646">In the context of the initiative, called Ossi's initiative, US breeders can also undertake to use that other one from them farmed seeds free of charge.</seg>
<seg id="2647">This does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and do not sell it. "open source" breeders allow you to cross it to make your own sorts - two aspects which are prohibited by many plant patrons or prescribed by many plant patrons.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Whispering views</seg>
<seg id="2650">Professor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi's board member Jack Kloppenburg are control of the seed and possibility of breeding new plants, both important for food security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">It plays an important role in larger cohappings such as biodiversity, rights of farmers, control over the nutrition system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeder would not attempt to use the latter, not just a little while making use of natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg is emphasised that the "open source" movement are not busy with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetable, grain, genetically modified or not, from environmental sustainability, which is the most recent examples of being offered in the global agricultural industry, such as being offered on farmers in August and September 2016, should also know that the way how this vegetables is bred and threatened.</seg>
<seg id="2654">Nutritional sovereign without seed sovereignty is not possible. "</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed initiative undertake care of that their seed will continue to be available free of charge. thus, your advantages are in contrast to patenting seeds and plant features.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo of Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi-Supporters argued that the future of food supplies are endangered, since the available genepool due to the increasingly large-quality intellectual property rights on plant material, which is therefore always limited to shrink.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, Executive Director of Ossi, engaged in her PhD thesis with genetic variation on carrots and their availability. it found out that about one-third of all raw materials are protected as intellectual property, making it either available either as a plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2659">For other plants, there are still no estimates, but experts, such as Luby, that massacred plants such as wheat in even bigger style are patented as salad or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of vision</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants become so farmed that they have targeted attributes - from such that their taste or their colour improves until such, because of them prospers and threats like pests and diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponent of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders are increasingly paying by more patents. genetic diversity be currently more needless than ever before, since the changing conditions are much worse than ever before climate change are worse.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail, Monsanto-spokesperson Carly Scaduto believes that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsantos's activities. with altogether four cooperative banks and co-operation with institutions such as the United States, set up the company for the preservation of the genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">However, they contradicts that intellectual property is other breeders, since "patents and the protection of plant varied innovation". "a patent is basically taken into a plan that everyone can keep when the patent is expired.</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often this instructions help others to come with another method to get the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Such a protection is not inhibits innovations, but encourages them to the public more material and know-how can be made available. "</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton does not look at it: 20 years to wait until a patent is certainly no innovations.</seg>
<seg id="2668">"" "" "" "and if you have to wait for a long time to make plants, which have been adapted to the changed environmental conditions, one would have lost the struggle." ""</seg>
<seg id="2669">The main argument for Morton requires that genetic resources have always been a general public and continue to remain: "independent plant breeding have neither the time nor the money for such formalities, and monetaries are not attractive for us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want to make farmers to ease their work.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"" "what is it that leads us, and it is impossible to use us if we are not able to use the best and most recent genetic resources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2672">"" "all in all Morton defends himself to patented, plant features:" "" "we are not creating the characteristics." ""</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form them out and the breeder, we finally have no idea how the plants do it.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeding in the U.S. state, Oregon and Ossi's Executive Board, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "whoever builds a sort of breeding even his own values in them.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believes in industrial agriculture with large farms and monoculture believes, are needed to produce measures in herbicide, breeding in its varieties of this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is highly respected. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized enterprises (such that move on international markets, but smaller than Z. B. Monsanto are) patents, do not create most smaller seed companies, even without patents - either reject it or do it for too expensive and therefore do not remuneration or both is the case.</seg>

<seg id="2682">I need to do new material for my catalogue, since I know that my competitors are reseller to sell my varieties in a few years ago, "he says." with a patent for 20 years ago it is just beautiful. "worldwide resonance</seg>
<seg id="2683">Indeed, the US seem to be the leader in the "Open Source" breeding leader, but the concept spreadeth quickly to all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ("Centre for Sustainable Agriculture"), which itself itself as professional organisation in the area of resources, is an "open source" seed sector. "to preserve the seed of traditional commercial applications, the centre of farmers collaborates and helps them to achieve new varieties that fulfill certain requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports them to come to "Open Source" -seeds and sell their own.</seg>

<seg id="2687">(regulations for breeding themselves differ from country to land, for the Ossi obligation not just one can be found one in Europe or other parts of the world.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">At the beginning of November 2016, the executive of the European Union, the European Commission, declares that conventionally bred plants should not be patented. thus, it speaks against the current practice of the European Patent Office, the patents applied on conventionally bred plants.</seg>
<seg id="2689">However, a statement is not yet a law; now it is now to the governments of the Member States to implement the Patent Office to implement these new line.</seg>
<seg id="2690">In October 2016 the Dutch organization Hivos organized a conference on "Open Source" plant systems in Ethiopia to speak non-governmental organizations and seed companies from all East Africa to learn something about the "Open Source" seed movement and the worldwide trend towards patmentation of seeds.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos' Program for Open Source "seeds declares that the organization is currently generating a worldwide alliance for" Open Source "plant systems that will fall off the official start next year.</seg>

<seg id="2721">An increasingly unlock the Egyptian authorities in the internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it hit the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a column.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend of the 5th August the Egyptian government made the website of the Human Rights for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world.</seg>
<seg id="2724">In August, the network published a position on Facebook in which it criticized the Egyptian authorities for this step of sharp, promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The law for Human Rights Information, in spite of this attack and the constitution of the Egyptian right and the Constitution by the authorities, has never been so difficult to overcome this part of the world, so that all technical possibilities would be exhausted, and not to admit it. we wait on it to meet our task.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is regarded as the first censored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt, after the authorities blocked up the independent news page MADA Masr, Arabic-speaking edition of the Huffington Post and Qatar of Qatar concerning congenital "support of terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1st Human Rights Organization of the Wave of the Weblateral casts for victims. @ anhri like one of the main sources of human rights in Arabic language https: / / t.co / NIZVOpDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">Besides ANHRI there is no access to the blog of the columnist and human rights advocated Ahmed Gamal Ziada is no access in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada took advantage of his blog for spreading of column and articles that he writes in Egypt's not accessible websites and media.</seg>
<seg id="2730">"" "" "" "now the blog which he set up in order to bypse the Zensurion of the Egyptian government, even the aim of an attack." ""</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, the supplier is native to Ziadas blog, however, is further accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity, after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces, while he reported about the student protests and experienced a video as the police force physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His article turn mainly around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a facebook page, Ziada is expressed by the government and reflected what this means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">The blogs to lock is very old, but has priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi, and even if the blocking of blogs may not be meaningful for the world, it is now for two reasons for me:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It has managed to mediate to me the feeling of a siege; an arrest, an attempt to murder, pre-charging at the national Security Council, the blocking Blogs, and every other website, for which I worked.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You have proven that I wrote not in vain. in other words, my words have an effect if also only a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I want to mention that this Blog was one Archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First, I used it to the post of articles to handle the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">But now, after they have locked him, and that they are afraid of words, can I change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The courageous goes to the way up to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (AFTE), Egyptian authorities opened up from 24 May to 06 August 133 web pages. this resulted in technical testing in the networks of different Internet Service Provider (ISP), including orange, Vodafone and Etisalat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">AFTE also documented the options of vendors, by changing newspaper censorship and private surfers, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">AFTE reported in their research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12, we beckoned how to offer the blocking of websites that offer VPNs.</seg>
<seg id="2746">A such practice indicates the intention of the government to block content and filtering content that could have access to the Egyptian users.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"" "" "" "the situation will be changed in addition to the implications of the sealed doors, so that the Egyptian population has no jurisdiction for the Egyptian population, through which it can proceed for judgment against these acts." ""</seg>

<seg id="2887">A few days after his escape, Asharaf found himself again in Pakistan.</seg>
