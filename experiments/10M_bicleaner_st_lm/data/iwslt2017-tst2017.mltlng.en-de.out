this is James R@@ isen .
you might know him maybe because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times @-@ repor@@ ter .
for a long before someone list@@ ened to Edward Snow@@ den , R@@ isen wrote a book , in which he spectacular released that the N@@ SA &apos;s illegal phones are heard by Americans .
but it is a different chapter , which should leave a permanent impression .
in this he describes a cat@@ ast@@ roph@@ ic US intelligence operation in which the CIA had literally over@@ thrown to Iran for a nuclear bomb .
if it sounds crazy , read it .
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who didn &apos;t really liked the chapter at all ?
the U.S. government .
for almost 10 years , the government filed against R@@ isen and called him to call his alleged sources .
in this train , he was ordained as a symbol for the design of the government , W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower , and journalists .
according to the first Constitutional Court , the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right , if media doesn &apos;t receive this information , and if they can &apos;t protect the identity of the cour@@ ageous they give .
so when the government arrived at R@@ isen , he did something that many cour@@ ageous repor@@ ters were already before him : he refused and said that he would prefer to go into prison .
from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen was still living with the risk to go into prison .
but then , only days before the process , happened something unusual .
suddenly , even though it was necessary for years , they were crucial for their case , the demands of the government were dropped .
the reason : in the time electronic monitoring , the repor@@ ters and sources can always have to hide .
instead of f@@ ails and cen@@ tives to fulfil , this also could do his digital foot@@ steps for him .
and then the investig@@ ator have not wor@@ ried about his understanding , his telephone numbers ,
as well as his e @-@ mail data , financial and ban@@ kin@@ dly information , its credit balance , and even travel documents with the list of its flights .
in the midst of these information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling , a CIA @-@ W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower and Ris@@ ens source .
unfortunately , this is just one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower by his arrival , but instead the judi@@ ci@@ ary has condemned more than all US governments in front of him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now you can imagine what a problem can be , especially because the government is involved much from their work as ge@@ home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since September 11 , almost every article on national security was the result of that a W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower went to a journalist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we therefore put the press work on the game that should be protected by the first Constitutional Treaty , because the government has always more possibilities to increase all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but just as the technology of the government allows to b@@ yp@@ ass the rights of Rep@@ orters , the press can also use technologies to protect their sources better .
and indeed they can pick up from the moment in which they contact us , rather than in the night , in the testimony .
today there are communication software that it still didn &apos;t have to be , when R@@ isen had written his book , and it is much more secure than normal e @-@ mails or telephone calls .
such a technology is a Secure@@ Drop , an open source crossing system designed by Aaron S@@ wart@@ z , which was originally developed by us and has been working today by the Freedom of the Press Foundation .
rather than send an e @-@ mail , go to a news website , such as the Washington Post here .
there you can upload documents or send documents , such as in any ordinary contact form .
these will then be encrypted and stored on a server , which has access the relevant news agency .
so the government does not expos@@ e more information secretly , and many of the information that would like to request it would not be available in advance .
Secure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments around the world still develop new sp@@ y technologies that all are at risk .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not only that the supplier of technology such as Edward Snow@@ den offer an opportunity to protect mis@@ cellaneous abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important that we protect the next W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the alarm against abuse of soldiers in the supply of soldiers who wants to report from over@@ crow@@ ded hospitals . or to the next environmental worker , the alarm to the sigh@@ ted water of F@@ lin@@ t . or a Wall@@ wall @-@ Insider who warned us before the next financial crisis .
however , these technologies were not only made for those who want to cover crime , but to protect all of the constitutional rights .
thank you .
&#91; on April 3 , 2016 the largest data le@@ ck of history was published . &#93; &#91; what does this mean ? &#93; &#91; what does this mean ? &#93; &#91; what does this mean ? &#93; &#91; what does this week have been hidden by News about a L@@ eck of 11 million documents of the local law firm Mos@@ pack Fon@@ se@@ ca
publication of these documents have a small insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
we get an impression how customers , banks and lawyers are going to companies such as Mos@@ bag Fon@@ se@@ ca and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set it up ? &quot;
we really see the e @-@ mails , the exchange of messages , how the whole system works as it works .
this has already led to the first very direct consequences .
Iceland Prime Minister has withdrawn .
there are also reports that an alliance of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator B@@ ar al @-@ Assad , which has been signed at tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
it claims that a track of 2 billion US dollars on Russia &apos;s president Vladimir Putin is leading to a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous C@@ elli@@ sts .
now there will be a lot of rich people and others give the nervous about the next release , and to the next revealed documents .
it sounds like the plot of one agency &apos;s house or a John @-@ Gr@@ ish@@ am @-@ ROM .
it seems to be a cry of you , to me the ordinary people .
why should this be ?
but the truth is : if the rich and M@@ ighty is able to hide their fortune in tax ha@@ v@@ ases and not all of their taxes , then it means less funds for important public services such as healthcare , education , and roads .
and this affects us all .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revel@@ ations are phenom@@ en@@ al .
throughout the world , media and leading politicians , such as secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens are used by some few , to hide and dis@@ close their assets -- something that we have been discus@@ sing and un@@ cover for ten years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think many people will be very conf@@ using this whole world , and it is difficult to understand how this tax ha@@ v@@ ases work . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I always place it like a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sh@@ kap@@ i .
so , in another company , in another company , in another company what makes it almost impossible to understand , who is behind this prayer .
it may be very difficult for prosec@@ uting and tax authorities , as well as journalists or civil society really understand what is the matter .
I think it is interesting that there is less reports about this matter in the USA .
probably , because there are no prominent American Americans that came in these revel@@ ations , in this sc@@ andal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well , it is not so that there are no more rich Americans to hide their fortune in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but by the principle , after which these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ pack Fon@@ se@@ ca has less American customers .
could we have a d@@ le@@ ck of the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the United States .
in fact , it is so that in some U.S. states , less information needs to specify less information to found a company than to get a li@@ br@@ ID card .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this type of In@@ transparent in the US has allowed the employees from school districts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; school children &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has more ru@@ ff@@ ed , especially vulner@@ able che@@ eses .
it is this type of behavior , which affects us all .
here at the Global Wit@@ ness , we &apos;ll need to figure out how all this is in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a secret investigation into the offices of 13 companies in Manhattan .
our investigations gave himself as an African minister , who wanted to bring the suspected money to the United States to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
it really sho@@ cked it that all until an advoc@@ ate from our investigations , how he could transfer his money .
all of these lawyers were all pre@@ ferences . none of these lawyers accepted us as a client and of course there was no man to get there money . however it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important to consider this not as individual cases .
it is not going to give a certain lawyer , who presented our secret investig@@ ator suggestions .
it is not dealing with a single top of pol@@ ishes , wrapped in a sc@@ andal .
it &apos;s how the system works , through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability are being established .
and to handle this , we must change the rules of rules .
we must change the rules to make this type of behavior difficult .
this may all be very angry when we could do anything else ; as if nothing had changed anything , it &apos;s always the we@@ al@@ we@@ al@@ thy and M@@ ighty One .
but as bor@@ row@@ ed Optim@@ us , I really see that a lot has begun to change .
in the past few years we have seen signs to greater transparency , which concerns the owners of companies .
the theme found political attention by the British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
ever since then , the EU has been group@@ ed in central regist@@ ers on the national level , who is really behind companies in Europe , and who controls them .
one of the un@@ pleasant facts is that the US will leave behind .
representatives of both parties have taken a bill in both Parliament &apos;s chambers , but this makes not the progress that we would like to see .
we would really like to see how this Panama &apos;s revel@@ ations , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , used as resources to ensure greater transparency in the US and global .
for us , at Global Wit@@ ness , this is a moment for changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need common people who are mad when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind head@@ lights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need Directors in the business , standing and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ transparent is not good for the business &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we need leading politicians that recognize the problem and deplo@@ y themselves through the laws of this kind of transparency .
together we can end the In@@ transparent , which now makes this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing , finally complete .
this is the story , as I was almost ab@@ duc@@ ted and in the trunk of a red Maz@@ das would be .
a day after I finished my design studies , I made a rear shop .
a guy in the Maz@@ da was left and looked down my stuff .
he bought one of my works .
he was alone in the city and made a road trip to the whole country . afterwards he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while we paid the invoice , I made the mist@@ akes to ask him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Where do you sleep today ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he did the whole thing even worse : &quot; I don &apos;t know it . &quot;
and I thought : &quot; Oh , man !
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer sleeping space now ?
but I just didn &apos;t know it ! he says he would go to the peace cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans . I don &apos;t want to lie down in the boot of a Maz@@ das !
that &apos;s a small car boot !
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How please ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
night I was in bed , I was star@@ ed to the ceiling , I thought , &quot; Oh ! what haven &apos;t I j@@ ump@@ ed to me ?
a wild adult sleeps in my living room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what if he is crazy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I got a fear that I went out of bed , at the ti@@ a @-@ pointed to the door , and closed my sleep door .
but he was not mad .
we are still in touch .
the artwork , which he had bought from me today depends on his class@@ room . he is a teacher now .
that was my first experience as a host . it has completely changed my viewing angle .
perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood have been sold , actually , friends who were waiting for it ?
people on my air mattress was to accommodate me . it was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress .
we make a leap , two years later ...
I am jo@@ bless , almost ple@@ ite , my roommate draws up and the rent is increased .
I learned that there had been a design conference at that time . all hotels were fully booked .
I think , creativity can do it , fear in fun .
I wrote my best friend and new fellow coun@@ try@@ men Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I could bring it to a designer @-@ bed @-@ and @-@ breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk including breakfast , a mattress and every morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a site and founded such a &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were able to sleep for 20 dollars on air matt@@ resses on wooden floors .
they found it great , and we also found .
I &apos;m sure to decor@@ ate our cheese ham and cheese . completely different because we made them for our guests .
we t@@ oured them through the whole city . as we did our last guest , and at the door to the castle , Brian and I joined us .
had we just discovered that we could find new friends and we were able to pay our rent ?
the things came into rolls .
my former roommate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out how to make a business concept .
so we presented to the investors : &quot; we want to create a site , on the people public images of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their homes -- the kind of rooms whose doors one closes when you come by .
over the Internet , they can invite wild people to stay with them .
this will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited that the miss@@ ile had been ign@@ ited .
but she did not .
no one who is still in consol@@ ation , would invest in a business , which allows foreigners to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we have learned to all children , strangers are dangerous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have a problem , you explain to things that can be good . we were designed to design .
at the Academy of Fine Arts , we learned that design is much more than just look and h@@ ap@@ ti@@ k -- it &apos;s the overall life .
we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create trust through design , among people who had never met before .
can design be so anything ?
is it possible to create with design confidence ?
I would like to give you a sample , which degree trust we moved .
it &apos;s a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort one .
thum@@ bs up if you are ready .
take your mobile phone in your hand .
now I would like to un@@ lock your mobile phone .
enter your ent@@ lock mobile phone on your left seat .
this silent suit of pan@@ ic , which you will feel -- -- is exactly what hosts will feel when they open the door first time .
for the only thing that is still personal as your mobile , is your home .
visitors can not only read your text , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to keep the un@@ locked mobile phone of a foreig@@ ner in the hands ?
most feel the responsibility .
so , most guests feel when they are somewhere else .
only this reason , our company may exist .
only so , who actually has Al Go@@ res cell now ?
could you preach the Twitter that it should be elected to the president of the president ?
you can return the cell phone now .
you have experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I would like to tell you of some discover@@ ies .
what if we had changed a small detail in this experiment ?
what if your neigh@@ bor would have been presented once again with his name ; if he would have told what he comes , like his dog or his children ?
imagine , you might have 150 convic@@ tions that say : &quot; he can really hold fast the mobile phones ! &quot;
how would you feel then if you would have to give your mobile phone ?
the trust also strengthens the confidence of a well @-@ per@@ ate feedback system .
at the beginning , we have made some things wrong .
it was hard to aband@@ on people &apos;s neg@@ atives .
finally , we decided to wait for both hosts and guest their findings , before we presented them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we studied with Stan@@ ford a study . we examined how likely it is that people trust in each other as they are similar to age and residence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; little sur@@ prisingly , we trust the people most , who are most like the most like . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the more differences we find , the less trust we .
this is a natural social security engineer .
exciting , if you add the call of a person -- in our case by app@@ ra@@ isal .
if you have fewer than three convic@@ tions , there is nothing changes .
but it has more than ten , changes all .
a good reputation is common simil@@ ar@@ ities .
so , the correct design can help us to overcome some of our deeply ro@@ oted pre@@ ferences .
Moreover , we drove that confidence is dependent on it , how much one gives off .
here you see the reactions to the first news of a guest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you tell a little bit , like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hi ! &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you don &apos;t get any answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one tells you too much , such as : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- the request is also not accepted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is therefore an optimal degree of open@@ ness , for example &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tol@@ le Art@@ work &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in your apartment ! I &apos;m doing with my family holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how can you create it with design to create these degrees in Open@@ ness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct quantity text . we also give tips to what subjects should write something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help to overcome our advantages against foreigners . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with which we did not reck@@ oned , the great amount of people who were more than ready to lay down these advantages .
here you see how many people take our offer .
you can recognize three things .
first : incredibly good luck .
secon@@ dly , the un@@ ti@@ ring work of our team .
third : a need that was not covered before .
the shop is just very good for us .
of course , there &apos;s also times if not everything goes smooth .
there were guests who have been celebrated parties celebrated or devast@@ ated homes .
hosts must have guests in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked on customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I got at the front when confidence is broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it already hur@@ ting when I think only .
the dis@@ appoint@@ ments , which list@@ ens to the voice of the anus , was and will always be our biggest motivation to improve us further .
fortunately , only a fra@@ ction was one problem of the 123 million overnight stays .
for people confi@@ ded one to another .
when confidence is working , won@@ dro@@ us works are created .
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . he suffered a heart attack there .
his hosts went into the hospital .
he even stopped blood for the necessary surgery !
here is his assessment :
&quot; perfect house for travelers that tend to heart attack because of sitting activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with plenty of hospitals .
Javier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real man@@ s@@ ails that save life , even though they don &apos;t know it .
you drive a car to the hospital , when you die , and wait , while you get a b@@ yp@@ ass .
because they don &apos;t want that one feels , they bring books by .
you can stay one even longer , without charging the extra night .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
it is , of course not any stay .
but these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when I became the first time about this term , I asked me : &quot; &quot; &quot;
how does the thought of part with money transactions put together ?
it goes here to commercial trade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it just call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lease industry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not just the case . &quot; &quot; &quot;
share Economy describes a trading that promises human relationships .
people lay a part of themselves , and that changes all .
if you travel today , it is easily compare with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
but what would be , if traveling a rich buffet is from local impressions ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what if you have visited every place , you have visited a group there , a group there would be a thoroughly re@@ plen@@ ished and one of the K@@ nei@@ pent@@ our district , one of whom you have never heard . &quot; &quot; &quot;
or if you want to learn about a five @-@ star chef ?
nowadays apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what would be if we would like to arrange apartments from the ground up to the roomm@@ ates ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would have in the thoughts of common groups ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I set up the cities which allow us and relationships , instead of sol@@ itude and fir@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this project was begun in South Korean , where this project started . lots of parking that belonged to the government ,
17 people were offered . students who were looking for a stay of lead in the search of a residence ,
they were convey@@ ed to humans whose children were gone out , they were incub@@ ated programs .
in order to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy , over our platform alone 7@@ 85 000 people are participating in 191 countries by a stranger , a stranger , or even hosts .
the idea seems to be so crazy about how it was taught us .
we didn &apos;t invented the wheel .
hospitality has also been previously .
there were already similar websites before us .
so why did our work ?
apart from luck and timing we found that you can find the right design with the components of confidence .
design can help us to overcome deep root parts .
I find it in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ing ,
almost absolutely overwhelming .
I have to think about it , when a red Maz@@ da drives me over .
we know of course , that design can not solve every problem .
but if it could help us if it had this great influence , I wonder how we can use design soon .
thank you .
what do you think when you see me ?
a cred@@ itor ? a expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or supp@@ resses , under@@ taking a brain under@@ wear , a terror female ?
or simply a delay about the airport of security at the airport .
that is indeed true .
I don &apos;t give you the fault to your negative impressions .
such is the media , such as I look like .
a study revealed that 80 % of the coverage of Islam and Muslims are negative .
studies show : the Americans have known my , most would have no Muslims .
probably the people don &apos;t speak with their U@@ ber drivers .
for all those who have never met an Muslims : it is great , you want to know .
I tell you , who am I .
I am a mother , a coffee @-@ operated -- double es@@ pres@@ so , with wh@@ ipped cream extra .
I am persu@@ aded ,
a carr@@ y@@ holder @-@ fan @-@ fan in ,
and I am a pract@@ ising , spiritual Muslim min .
but not like Lady G@@ aga is singing , because , baby , I was not born .
I op@@ ted for this .
when I was 17 , I met the decision to ou@@ ten me .
no , not as hom@@ os@@ exual man , as some of my friends but as Muslim . I decided to bear the Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head cover .
my femin@@ ist friends were astonished : &quot; why do you afflic@@ t yourself ? &quot;
the L@@ ust@@ y was : at that time it was a femin@@ ist declaration of independence , namely with the pressure that I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old , give me a perfect and un@@ achiev@@ able beauty ideal .
I have not only accepted the faith of my parents .
I have clu@@ ster@@ ed with Kor@@ an .
I read it , thought after the question , doub@@ ted and believed last .
my relationship to God was not love at first sight .
it was confidence and slow dev@@ otion , which deep@@ ened with each reading of the Kor@@ an .
the beauty of rhyth@@ mi@@ k bring me sometimes to the wines .
I acknowledge myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
had you ever feel the feeling that someone doesn &apos;t perc@@ eive you ? is it som@@ eh@@ ow like that som@@ eh@@ ow like ?
so it feels .
later I married and started , like all the good Egyptians , my career as a engineering .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I later , after my marriage , a child , and lived in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then came the terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I sat in my kitchen , at the end of the breakfast , looked on the screen and saw the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Eil@@ feedback &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was smoke , air@@ planes flo@@ at in buildings , people spread from buildings .
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical distur@@ b@@ ance ?
my sho@@ ck was turning quickly into indig@@ nation .
why should one do something ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I changed the channel and heard : &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; Muslim terror@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ji@@ had ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oh my God .
it is not only that my country was attacked , but in the N@@ u converted me the deeds of another by a civil war into a susp@@ ects .
that same day we had to go through the Central West of the USA to draw back into a new city and start the post@@ graduate course .
I remember - as we knew -- as we were silent -- so deep it went into my seat , and I feared the first time when Muslims are recognized .
we moved to our apartment in this night , in a new city , where it felt like a completely different world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then I heard and read the war@@ nings of the national Islamic organizations that said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be careful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Do not be careful in good fighting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not deceived you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed all the week indoor .
then it was Friday in that week -- the day when Muslims gathered to prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and again the war@@ nings , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Go not on this first Friday , the mosque could be a target . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I saw my extensive coverage .
the feelings were under@@ stand@@ ably , and I heard of attacks on Muslims or of people who had stayed for Muslims who destroyed and struck down .
there were really ag@@ gi@@ es on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because people who had attacked this country had attacked our country .
I pushed the rage of people to terror@@ ists .
imagine ! I was too angry .
it is not easy to explain itself .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
these are the alleg@@ ations that are hard .
nowadays we can actually hear people : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims .
when will we go ? &quot;
people want to beat Muslims and mos@@ ques .
they speak about my congregation , like a tumor in the body of the USA .
it is only the question : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or good ?
you know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tumor is removed as a whole and a good tumor is under observation .
the alternatives are point@@ less because the question is wrong .
Muslims are , like all other Americans , no tumor in the body of the USA , but an important organ .
thank you !
Muslims are inventor and teachers , nar@@ ro@@ fer and Olymp@@ ik Ris@@ ks .
will the locking of mos@@ ques America do more secure ?
there may be a couple of parking lots but not stop the terror .
regular visits to a mosque manages to consider people with other faith more toler@@ ant , and greater civil participation .
and as I told me a lad@@ der in the Washington area , DC recently told : people are actually not al@@ loc@@ alized in mos@@ ques .
they are ra@@ dic@@ alised in their cellar or bed in front of a computer .
during the radio process , it is found that he begins online . as a result , the person &apos;s person has been cut off , even from their family that the terror@@ ists are taking true Muslims , and everyone who ab@@ h@@ ors their behavior and their ide@@ ology , is a tra@@ itor or belief .
if we want to prevent radi@@ cal@@ ization , we must keep the people to keep the mosque .
some are still in claim that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group such as the IS had its brut@@ ality with the Quran .
as Muslim , mother , as man , I believe that we must do everything to stop a group as the IS .
but we would like to put us in their performance world when they recognize them as a representative of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ club @-@ Kl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ide@@ ology reasons on their &quot; Holy Book . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when you saw a look at it , they don &apos;t drive them up what they had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Scrip@@ tures &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is her brood , which they can read these things in the Scrip@@ tures .
an outstanding impression told me recently an amazing story :
a girl came to him , because they came to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked if they had been in contact with radi@@ al religious leaders .
he said , the problem was the opposite . any cl@@ ergy with whom she had spoken , she brought her away to silence , and said her to her mind for un@@ righteousness in the world , only in trouble .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of nothing insp@@ ires and something that had given her anger , she was a main goal for instrum@@ ent@@ alisation by extrem@@ ists who promised a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this im@@ am turned the connection to God and its church again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
instead of working for her anger , he showed her construc@@ tive ways for a real change in the world .
what she met in the mosque , she kept them before joining the IS .
that was an insight , like the Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia and aff@@ ecting my family .
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it affect every other ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of anxi@@ ety every day on our democracy , to our freedom of thoughts ?
a study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we fear us , at least three things happen .
we rather accept an authorized governmental system , conformity and pre@@ judi@@ ces .
one study shows : if one reports a test subjects , in which negative was reported on Muslims , they represent more military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not just an academic problem .
when you look , when the mood for Muslims were up in relation to Muslims -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it was in advance of the Iraq war and during the two @-@ day periods .
so , Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia is not simply the natural response to Muslim terrorism , as I expected it .
it can actually be a tool for manip@@ ulating the public to acquire the foundation of a free society , the sensible and well informed citizens .
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we perhaps feel it as the first , but the toxic air of the fear gives us all .
in the assignment of collective bonds it is not only to explain himself to himself .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school .
De@@ ah was a sport@@ s@@ men .
he was involved in the dental fac@@ ulty , talented , of promising ...
his sister would say to me that he was the sweet , a generous person whom she knew .
she visited him and he showed her cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um . she was amazing and said :
&quot; when ever happened to my breasts such an experienced young man ? &quot;
just a few weeks after visiting Su@@ z@@ anne for her brother and his wife , Craig Stephen H@@ icks , she was murdered , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an who visited the afternoon . he did it in her apartment , as with a execution after he had posted be@@ ats against Muslims on his Facebook page .
he shot eight times on De@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism can not only be fatal , but also deadly .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
are we gone to the mosque , or we stayed safe at home ?
we bes@@ ought it and for us it was not a light decision , because it was therefore that America we want to leave our children : one that would control us through fear , or one in which we can exercise our religion .
we decided to the mosque .
with our son in child &apos;s seat , we moved to the mosque .
I took him out , and my shoes went out , went into the building hall , and what I saw , let me hold .
the hall was completely filled .
then the im@@ am made a announcement , and was welcomed our guests , because half of the meetings were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hist@@ s , Ath@@ ei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but by us .
in this moment I am collap@@ sed .
these people were there , as they had courage and compassion pan@@ ic , and pre@@ judi@@ ces .
what will you choose ?
what are you going to choose the fear and fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism at the moment ?
will you go on number safe ?
or will you join them that are my : we are better than those who are .
thank you very much .
thank you beautiful !
Helen Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a Ner@@ ve .
but I wonder what you say that you might say that you &apos;re talking a T@@ ED@@ Talk , a monument with dr@@ au@@ ght work , thus an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say that you don &apos;t think . I &apos;m totally normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am so usual , as it is allowed .
if one can look at Muslims in all over the world , and I did that with the largest ever carried out on Muslims in the world , people want normal things .
they want to be well @-@ being for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I &apos;m not an exception .
if people like an exception to rule , then often the rule is broken , and they are not the exception to rule .
HW : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists began to make one billion business shortly before .
monitoring , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for professional dr@@ ones . it is made possible in research institutions around the world .
before air @-@ package in our social consciousness , a autonomous fleet of flight machines at the Fra@@ c Centre in France was built live in front of the audience a six @-@ metre high tower of 1 500 bricks . some years ago it started to fly with arrows .
by connecting the aero@@ drome , high speed and acceleration of the smallest space can be connected .
you can also build self @-@ lev@@ able structures .
they learned to carry loads , to deal with tur@@ bul@@ ences and generally respond to natural laws .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the limits of possible in autonomous flight .
so that a system aut@@ on@@ om works must know it collective compl@@ ying , where in the room the mobile objects are located .
in our lab at the ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects . this allows us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
we use a new loc@@ alization technology of Ver@@ ity Studios , a branch of our laboratories .
there are no external cameras .
each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the space , calculations on board determine what the machine should do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; external commands are available in the highest layer . for example , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; land &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called tail@@ starter ,
one aircraft , trying to beat two flying with a f@@ lap .
like other star@@ ters , it is efficient in the down@@ ward flight , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all their variations .
in contrast to most of the star@@ ring gl@@ ers , it can be flo@@ at , and therefore has great advantages with start and landing , and is very versatile .
but there is always a swe@@ eping page .
a limitation of tail@@ or @-@ star@@ ters is that they are sensitive to tur@@ bul@@ ls like wind turbines .
we develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the device doesn &apos;t matter what is capable of recovered position and improves performance by practice .
okay .
during our research , we often ask fundamental abstract questions which lead to the core of cause .
such a question would be : what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there is practical reasons to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known as a machines that are known as machines with a thousand movable parts that I did to viol@@ ate you .
for decades ago , trained pilots could fly @-@ controlled flight units , which only had two moving parts : a propeller and a stern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ long discovered we discovered that flies only works with only one . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the Mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechanically eas@@ iest and remote flight . it was short invented in short .
it only has a movable part , a propeller ,
no s@@ apping , hing@@ es and trans@@ verse lines , no other positions or control surfaces , only one propeller .
although there is mechanically simple , inside life happens very much so that it can fly as stable and can move in the room .
nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear star@@ ters . to bring it to flying , I have to throw it exactly right .
the lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood of seeing it exactly right when I see all , is small , therefore I show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening .
when the mon@@ opol@@ y is an exercise in pleas@@ ures , this machine is here , the Omni@@ cop@@ ter with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in over@@ flow .
what to do with all this over@@ flow ?
they see that he is only symmet@@ ri@@ cally .
therefore he is ambi@@ val@@ ent in his orientation .
thereby he receives the remaining ordinary skill ,
in the room to move in all directions , no matter what direction he is rot@@ ated , or even like it rot@@ ates .
of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers of eight prop@@ ellers .
some is available in models , the rest is lear@@ ns directly at the flies .
let us see that .
if flight machines are to be part of our everyday life , it must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine is composed of two separate two @-@ propeller aircraft engines .
this turns in clock@@ wise
and the other about the clock@@ wise .
when you build them , they are like a high @-@ performance Quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
but if something wrong -- a motor or propeller falls off , the electronics or a battery -- the machine can continue to fly if also restricted .
we will demonstrate it now by making a half air@@ worthy .
the last demonstration studied synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units facilitates a pallet on aesthetic expression .
we took commercial micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- every single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equ@@ ip them with loc@@ alis@@ ing technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where it is in space and is self @-@ controlled . therefore there is no limit .
hop@@ efully , you hop@@ efully motiv@@ ate this demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine as dr@@ one wants to get a flying lamp screen on Broadway .
of course it is difficult to predic@@ table the influence of this technology .
for types like us , the reward in the development and the Schaff@@ ner act .
it serves as a reminder , how wonderful and magical our universe is , and that it is creative to shape them in so spectacular fashion .
the fact that this technology has such a massive and economic potential , the bag is on the i .
thank you very much .
more than 1.3 billion years ago , in a very far distant galax@@ y , two black holes are always qu@@ icker , you walked so the mass of three lights in a tenth of a second in pure energy .
for short moment , they lights brigh@@ ter than all stars along the galax@@ ies of the entire universe .
it was a very big kne@@ eling .
but they didn &apos;t bring their energy in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was given into space @-@ time po@@ s ourselves and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we arrange the events initially tim@@ ely .
just 1.3 billion years ago , the life was formed on Earth .
ever since then the earth has brought much : cor@@ als , fish , plants , sau@@ rier , people and -- God stand up for us with -- even the internet .
about 25 years ago , a group of particularly cour@@ ageous -- R@@ ai Weiss decided to build a huge laser detector by Ronald Dre@@ ver , a gig@@ antic laser detector , which arise out by gra@@ vit@@ ic@@ ating black holes .
the majority kept them crazy .
but enough people saw them as crazy gen@@ ies , so that the US National Science Foundation was financed their idea .
after decades of tel@@ eg@@ ger development , design , conception and extremely hard work , they built the detector L@@ IG@@ O : the Laser Inter@@ fer@@ ometer Ob@@ servatory .
in the following period , the precision of L@@ IG@@ O could significantly increased significantly , significantly improved the recognition rate .
therefore , it is called Advanced L@@ IG@@ O .
at the beginning of September 2015 L@@ IG@@ O was launched for a final test run around certain smaller , hard @-@ hard problems .
on September 14 , 2015 , only a few days after the start @-@ up of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ality shafts of both colon@@ ized black holes through the Earth .
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hug@@ hes : only two moments in my life were emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the good@@ bye to my father &apos;s father .
basically these were the fruits of my life .
all this , what I worked , is no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hug@@ hes , theoretical physi@@ cist at the MIT . he studied Gra@@ vity from black holes and their observ@@ atories like L@@ IG@@ O . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ?
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is an forces in the area of space and time .
when passing the shaft , the space and its entire content will be stretched into one direction and into the other .
to illustr@@ ative teaching in courses in courses for the theory of rel@@ ativity , often a really al@@ ber@@ ed dance .
&quot; stretching and dust , stretching and dust . &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves extremely weak , even ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous .
on 14 September , for example , everyone was stretched by us when gathering of the waves and stretching . the expansion of an average people amounted to 10 high -@@ 21 .
this means 20 n@@ ul@@ ls according to the comm@@ a , followed by 1 . this is the L@@ IG@@ O employees for crazy .
with a five @-@ kilometer @-@ long laser detector , which is already ab@@ sur@@ d , it would have to be exactly measured on less than an exchange of the radius of a nuclear @-@ core . this is Gr@@ ot@@ es@@ k .
at the end of his classic text about grav@@ itation
&quot; &quot; &quot; described K@@ ip Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder L@@ IG@@ Os , hunting after waves as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the technical difficulties for the construction of such detectors are enormous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but physi@@ c@@ ists are final and with the support of the public , all obstacles are overcome . &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this in 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to L@@ IG@@ O . Scott claims that L@@ IG@@ O be more an ear than an eye .
I want to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavelength , which is much smaller than the things around us : facial features , the size of your phone .
that &apos;s quite practical . for this way you can produce a picture or a map of things by taking it from several points to feed you around you .
with sounds that is different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters .
therefore it is very hard to produce a picture of things that are particularly important to you :
about the face of your child .
instead , we listen to certain characteristics , such as clay and height , rhythm and volume to close behind the history .
&quot; now Alice &quot; speaks .
&quot; and Bob comm@@ ends her . &quot;
&quot; stup@@ idly Bob . &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we can do with them any simple images of objects in all .
but having regard to changes in am@@ plitude and frequency of waves , we can listen to ourselves their stories .
at least for L@@ IG@@ O , the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble range .
if we trans@@ form the shaft of shaft into all , we can literally hear the universe .
the grav@@ itation to listen , can tell us about the coll@@ ision of two black holes , which my colleague Scott are busy very long .
SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , zir@@ cons are simple : w@@ up@@ p !
the two bodies are very quick , sounds the same cir@@ cl@@ ed with an additional tone of sound . this is listening to : W@@ u @-@ wu : amount of :
it is a kind of movement , shaped into the wav@@ e@@ form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date , which at least I never heard here@@ after , I heard the sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with each 30 times the solar mass , turning around as fast as the rods of your mix@@ ers .
AA : we read about what this means .
two black holes , the di@@ ch@@ est body in all , one with a mass of 29 tons , the other with a mass of 36 tons , revol@@ ve hundreds of times per second before they col@@ li@@ de .
imagine the forces .
fantastic .
and we know it because we heard it .
it consists of the lead importance of L@@ IG@@ O .
L@@ IG@@ O eb@@ net a totally new way to explore the universe , as never before it was possible .
on this way we can listen to all sounds and the invisible .
we can not see much in all -- practically or basically --
a super@@ nova , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ al stars explo@@ de in Super@@ nov@@ ae .
they are very useful . of whom we learned much about the All .
the thr@@ illing physical processes can be done in the core , which is hidden behind thousands of iron , carbon and silicon kilometers .
we will never go through , because this op@@ ak are .
gra@@ vit@@ ation waves per@@ me@@ ates iron , as if it is a transparent glass . the prim@@ rose it would like to investigate the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it as the prim@@ rose from his own rep@@ ents .
with the help of gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , it should be possible to reflect back to the beginning .
and the most important thing : I &apos;m optim@@ istic that we have never seen in all things we have never seen , which we will never see . things we can only discover by hearing it .
in fact L@@ IG@@ O took part in the first attempt of things we did not expect .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Evans , a major member of the L@@ IG@@ O project says to this topic : me : the kind of stars that produce black holes , as L@@ IG@@ O they are observed , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe
they are enormous , ancient body from prehistoric times . the black holes are so fu@@ cking the Sau@@ erk@@ erk@@ y for our arch@@ e@@ ological work .
L@@ IG@@ O gives us a completely different viewing angle to the events in all , on the origin of the stars and ultimately , as we went out of that chaos .
AA : the challenge is now to be so cour@@ ageous as just as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thanks L@@ IG@@ O , we know how to build great detectors and l@@ ur@@ k the noise and bul@@ ls of the cos@@ mos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we need ideas for new Ob@@ serv@@ atories -- a completely new generation of Ob@@ serv@@ atories on Earth and in All .
for what could be more beautiful than to listen to the jung@@ le ourselves ?
now the time of great dreams .
dreams you with us .
thank you .
I tried out a experiment before some time .
one year long would I say to everything &quot; Yes ! &quot; I was afraid of which I was afraid .
no matter whether it got me nervous that brought me into un@@ pleasant situations , I forced me to say &quot; Yes . &quot;
would I speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
do I want to be live on television ?
no , but yes !
do I want to start playing with the show ?
no , no , yes , yes , yes .
and a foolish thing happened : exactly what I was afraid , when I was afraid , my fear terri@@ fied me .
my fear , talk to speak , my social fear -- Pu@@ ff , weg .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; Yes &quot; has changed my life .
&quot; Yes , changing me .
but there was a specific Yes , that my life pro@@ found@@ ly altered , an un@@ exp@@ ec@@ tedly art . it started with a question of my little ones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett , and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the youngest , calls for all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; estim@@ oni@@ als &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as it would be a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; prize , I need milk for my be@@ ak @-@ asse . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she asked them once , if I could play with her when I was just in the go . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes , I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this Yes it was the beginning
a new living setting in my family . by there , I swe@@ ars me always to play with them . no matter what I am doing , or wherever I go , I &apos;m always say Yes -- every single times .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I &apos;m tired .
it has a magical effect on me , on my children , to our family .
but it also has an amazing tri@@ gu@@ ing effect : I actually did it just short , that &quot; Yes &quot; would I saved my career with my children .
I have a real dream job .
I &apos;m a writer . I think myself from , set up life .
dream job .
no . no .
I am a titanium .
dream job .
I create TV . I create TV .
I &apos;m doing television , in a large style .
in this TV season , I &apos;m responsible for use to carry 70 hours of program into the world .
four TV programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production .
each shipment has hundreds of jobs , which did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a TV station can lie between three and six million dollars .
let &apos;s say five .
a new episode every nine days of four shows , i.e. every nine days 20 million dollars , four TV programs , 70 episodes : Grey &apos;s , 21 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours Television ,
350 million dollars for one season .
my television series will run on Thursday night in America .
all over the world , my series are running in 256 languages in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broad@@ casts , which I myself have created , and not only produced , so still alive . I must visit time , really silent , creative time to tell my fans of bon@@ fires and tell my stories .
four TV series , 70 hours television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , wareh@@ ouses around the world .
do you know who makes it even more ?
no one , that is why I am a titanium .
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to im@@ press you .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I tell it , because I know what you think , if the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; author &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; falls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I tell you , that all of you who work so hard , whether you work a company , a country , or a household , make me serious when I say , I say that I don &apos;t understand it with a dream job .
everything is a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all swe@@ at -- no tears .
I have been working much , hard and I love it .
if I got deeper into the work , there is no other feeling .
my work will always create a country out of no@@ where .
it &apos;s when I turned over to a screen when I got a painting .
as a dream , one is a high sound , lie@@ fs one marathon .
it feels like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that is at the same time .
I love it to work .
it is creative , mechanically , an@@ str@@ ati@@ ous and l@@ ump , funny and fear@@ ful , clin@@ ically and fear@@ ful , cru@@ el@@ ly and reasonable . and the best thing is the sum@@ s .
there is such a change in me when the work runs fine .
a sum@@ s starts in my head , and it grows and grows , and the sum@@ s list@@ ens as a busy street , I could go for you on it .
many people take , when I declare to them the sum@@ s that I persu@@ aded writing to my writing .
don &apos;t understand me wrong , this does it .
but the sum@@ s -- as I began to work and work as I began to work and to work , to create and collabor@@ ate , I discovered this thing , this sum@@ s , this energy . the sum@@ s !
the sum@@ s is more than write .
the sum@@ s is action and activity . the sum@@ s is drug .
the sum@@ s is music . the sum@@ s is light and air .
the sum@@ s is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have a sum , you cannot do differently compared to size .
the feeling , not different to achieve , regardless of size , no matter what price .
that is the sum of the sum@@ s .
or maybe it also means a Work@@ ah@@ olic .
perhaps it is gen@@ ius .
perhaps it is E@@ go .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I do not know .
I know only that I am not my failure , and I know only that I love the sum@@ s .
I just want to tell you , I &apos;m a titanium , and I know that I would not plan it in question .
in order to make a clear : the more broad@@ casts , the more broad@@ casts , the more broad@@ casts , the more work at the same time , the more things simultaneously , the more do I write history , the more things I write and more expectations there &apos;s more expectations .
the more I work to be successful , the more must work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the land , which I create , the marathon , I run , the army , the screen , the high sound , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s .
I like this sum@@ s . I love the sum@@ s .
I need the sum@@ s . I am the sum@@ s .
am I only this sum@@ s ?
and then the sum@@ s stopped .
revised , over@@ drawn , ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated , ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated .
the sum@@ s stopped .
now my three daughters are acc@@ ust@@ omed to the truth , that her mother is a single employee title .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my m@@ om will not be there , but you can write to my N@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Emer@@ ald says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to go to Sh@@ onda country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the children of a titanium .
they are Baby @-@ Titan@@ en .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the sum@@ s heard .
the sum of the engine was silent .
I loved my work anymore . the engine was out .
the sum@@ s did not return .
my sum@@ s was broken .
I made the same things as always : the same titanium work , 15 hours @-@ days , not a weekends , no Reu@@ ter , not deleg@@ ating , a Titan Store does not exist , with all your heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no sum@@ s .
in me was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was an indication of Titan ,
everything was gray , I just had no fun anymore .
and this was my life .
all that I did .
I was the sum@@ s and the sum@@ s was I .
so what do you do if what to do , the work which you love , suddenly f@@ ades ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know , some may think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Heu@@ l , cast you out , bl@@ ending the author Titan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know , you do it , man works to be someone dear to be a teacher , a ban@@ ker knows how to feel the sum@@ s when you knew the sum@@ s when the sum@@ s stops , who is it then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a titanium ?
when the song of my heart hears I can survive in silence ?
then my &quot; Southern States Kell@@ ys &quot; presents me a question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am on the way to the outside , too late and she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ om , don &apos;t you play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I will already say no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be aware of two things : &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; fir@@ stly , I have to say Yes to everything and second , she called me not &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prize . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she calls no more &quot; prize . &quot;
when did it happen ?
I hate it when I &apos;m playing Titan I and my sum@@ s , and here everything change my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ om , don &apos;t you play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I say , &quot; Yes . &quot;
it is nothing special .
we play and her sisters , we laugh too much , and I read out very dramatic from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot;
nothing exceptional .
but it &apos;s outstanding because my pain and my pan@@ ic , in sol@@ itude and lack of sum@@ mer@@ cies , I cannot do anything beyond .
I am foc@@ usses .
I am quiet .
the land , which I create , the marathon , I run , the army , the screen , the great sound - they do not exist anymore .
everything that exists , st@@ icky finger and hum@@ id k@@ isses , delicate voices , wa@@ ist pins and song , in which it goes to Los@@ sl@@ ate , or whatever the girl in &quot; The Ice Queen can &quot; get rid of .
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air in this place is so close that I hardly can bre@@ athe .
I can hardly believe that I might .
play the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ solves .
a mental door goes on and an energy differential comes in .
and that &apos;s not immediately , but it happens .
I feel it .
the sum@@ s come back slowly .
no full volume , hardly visible , it is quiet , hardly audi@@ ble , but it is there .
but not the sum@@ s , but a sum@@ s .
and now I feel when I know a magical mystery .
but let &apos;s remain with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . just love .
it is something that we forgot .
the sum , the work@@ men , the titanium , which is only the replacement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if I wonder if I say you will I tell you by the help of broad@@ casts and television and how working my brain is , then I &apos;ve forgotten what the real sum@@ s is . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sum@@ s is no strength and it is not working .
it depends on the joy .
the real sum@@ s depends on love .
the sum@@ s is the power that comes from the way of life .
the real sum@@ s is self @-@ conscious and peace .
the real sum@@ s are ig@@ no@@ red the printing of history , the expect@@ ation of the tasks , expect@@ ation and pressure .
the real sum@@ s is simple and original .
the real sum@@ s is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps I whis@@ per@@ ed to God the wrong words , for which God said to me that I am a titanium ?
it just love love .
we all need a bit more love , much more love .
once my child wants to play with me , I will say Yes .
I am doing this to a solid rule , so that I can deliver me as a workflow of any gu@@ ilt .
it &apos;s law , I have no other choice . I have no other option if I want to hear the sum@@ s again .
I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
play I don &apos;t play ans@@ at@@ zwe@@ ise as they work .
the truth does hurt ,
but I don &apos;t like it .
I always work , because I love it .
I rather am at work as a home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this conf@@ ession is pain@@ ful , for what a man should better be more than to be home ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
well , yes , I .
hon@@ est@@ ly , I call myself &quot; Titan . &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I am relaxed , it is none of them .
we round off in the garden , before and back , and back .
we make small dance parties ,
we sing and play Ball .
we cut bub@@ ble bub@@ bles .
in doing so I feel mainly sti@@ ff , ab@@ sent and conf@@ used .
I always take ri@@ pe after my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
my children show me how to live , and the sum@@ s of the universe met me .
I play and games until I ask myself : why have we ever heard with games ?
you can also say it ! Yes , if your child wants to play with you .
perhaps you will keep me for n@@ ai@@ v , for a day dre@@ amer .
there you may well , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et @-@ Show figure .
you can find less interesting than you think .
it is just 15 minutes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my little ones want to play at most 15 minutes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; playing with me until they want to make something different . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes , it replaces me a Marien@@ Beet@@ le or bis@@ cuit .
and he speaks my te@@ ie daughter whole 15 minutes long with me , I am the mother of the year .
there are only 15 minutes , more needs it not .
each can set up a piece of 15 minutes , even on a tu@@ ous @-@ La@@ une day !
15 minutes a piece !
no mobile , no clothes , no clothes .
the day is short : dinner , making children ready .
but 15 minutes are outside !
my children are my pro@@ sper@@ h@@ are , my world . it must not be the children . it is considered to feel the sum@@ s to have a place for his soul fri@@ eden .
it doesn &apos;t work with her own children . it &apos;s about pleasure ,
around the &quot; Play &quot; in general .
get out the 15 minutes !
find out what you do well .
find out it out and store it .
I &apos;m not perfect this . I f@@ ere and I fall . friends meet , books , enjoy the day --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will you play it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is short for all that I was abandoned , when I got my first TV show , when I was playing a titanium in the training , when I wanted to sur@@ pass myself more and more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
15 minutes on the piece , why doesn &apos;t it take full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the sum@@ s came back in my leisure time . the sum@@ s seems to return , when I do not work .
work is not working without gaming .
it takes time , but after a few months the power opens , and I find me again in my office . I list@@ ened to me and my soul . she inst@@ ances me new ideas . I use it in full bre@@ wing and love my work again .
I like the sum@@ s , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I am not the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s is not I ... no more .
bub@@ bles and st@@ icky fingers , dinner with friends .
this is my sum@@ s .
the sum@@ s of life .
the sum@@ s of love .
the sum@@ s of the work is part of me , but just one part . and I am so than@@ k@@ ful .
it is mine to me that I am a titanium . I never seen a titanium , who plays the journey to Jerusalem .
I said Yes to less work and more .
and yet have everything in the handle . my brain is still working . my camp fire still burn .
the more I play , the happ@@ ier are I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel better than a good mother .
the more I play , the more clear is my head .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the sum@@ s . the land , which I create , the marathon , the lin@@ ers , the fla@@ x , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s of life .
the more I feel this sum@@ s , the more making this unusual , ex@@ cl@@ ing , naked , and new feeling of life in me . less Titan -- more I !
the more I feel like this sum@@ s , the more I know who I am .
I &apos;m a writer . I think myself from , I awak@@ ening to life .
that is a job , that means to live his dream .
that is the dream of this jobs ,
for a dream job should have a little dream .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to less work and more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Titan@@ en have no chance here .
what do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you beautiful .
I am Neuro@@ sur@@ gin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human tragedy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I know how to change your life from one second to the other , after a heavy stroke , or after a car accident .
for neuro@@ surgery it is very fru@@ str@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability to support self @-@ healing .
after a severe injury of the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent , severe disability .
this is the reason why I functional Neuro@@ sur@@ ge .
what is a functional neuro@@ sur@@ geon ?
a doctor who tries to improve ner@@ ve functions by various surgical measures .
in certain they have one of the best known , the &quot; deep brain stimulation . &quot; thereby , you im@@ planted a electro@@ de deep in the brain to influence the circuits of neur@@ ons , so that the neuro@@ logical function improves .
it really is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Park@@ inson &apos;s fate , who suffered severe trem@@ ors and severe pain .
but Neuro@@ mod@@ ulation is not Ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geon is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion , we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close .
with some help , the brain can help themselves .
the story began 15 years ago .
at the time I was an Senior Physi@@ cian and worked in the emergency .
I often provided patients with skull @-@ trau@@ ma .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you need to imagine that the brain trau@@ ma is arbitr@@ ary and the brain cell is increasing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to save life , one must decrease the skull pressure .
for this , sometimes you need to remove a portion of sl@@ ender mass .
instead , instead of the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analy@@ ze us with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a biolog@@ ist , the brain mass .
what should I do ?
we wanted to grow cells from this t@@ issues .
this is no easy task .
found cells from a tissue piece is comparable with all small children that can be taken out of your families .
you need to find the right diet , temperature , moisture and the environments to prosp@@ er .
that exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts we managed Jean @-@ François .
he saw under his micro@@ scope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked exactly as a stem cell culture . with big green cells , surrounded by small , un@@ mature cells .
you may still know from the Bi@@ ological Less@@ ons that stem cells are un@@ ri@@ pe , which can trans@@ form into every cell type of organis@@ m .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small gro@@ oves of the brain .
it is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of brain mass in the surgery .
we made a further fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very fast .
they never die , they are imm@@ ort@@ al .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they were slowly and after a few weeks they died even .
so we saw a new , strange cell@@ ist population that looked like the stem cells , but was different .
we needed long to understand whence they came .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ b@@ lec@@ tic in @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make 4 % of our wholesale fish cells .
they play an important role in our development .
in the stage of the fet@@ us , they ensure the brain in the brain .
but why do they keep us ?
we don &apos;t know this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that it takes part in the healing of the brain , as we can find them in higher concentrations in brain injury . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that is not so certain .
one thing is however clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells .
we stand before a potential cell source that enables the brain healing .
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop a experiment .
we wanted to take a piece of brain areas out of the non @-@ lingu@@ istic area and then the cells accur@@ ately did as it did Jean @-@ François
and then mark them far@@ ther , in order to trace them in the brain .
during the last step , we im@@ planted them at the removal of the same individuals .
we call the aut@@ ologist Tran@@ splantation -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ splantation .
one of our first questions was : what happens when we im@@ planted these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we re@@ treat the same cells in dig@@ ged brain tissue ?
with the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller we were able to work with monkeys .
in the first scenario , we planted the cells in a healthy brain and we observed that they were completely lost after several weeks , they would go back home . the room is already occupied , they will not be used there , so they disappear .
in the second scenario , we added a violation and im@@ planted the same cells and now the cells remained , and they were able to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could watch under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that were im@@ planted .
the evidence that they show , are these little points . these are the cells that we stain@@ ed in vitro .
we could not stop natural .
do these cells help to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual D@@ exter@@ ity task .
they had to take fe@@ eder from a tray .
they made it very good .
when they had achieved a stable D@@ exter@@ ity level , we had the motor motor@@ ized in the motor bi@@ tex .
then the monkeys have been par@@ aly@@ zed , they could not move their hand anymore .
just as it would happen in humans , they recovered spont@@ ane@@ ously up to a certain degree , just like after a stroke .
patients are par@@ aly@@ zed and then try to recover a certain type of plastic mechanism . they get up to a certain degree , just like the monkey .
when we were sure that the monkey reached its degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted its own cells .
on the left , you &apos;ll see the monkey , which won &apos;t be spont@@ ane@@ ously .
he can deliver approximately 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from injury .
it is not so accurate and not so fast .
now you see , when we im@@ planted the cells : the same monkey , two months after the matur@@ ation .
I can tell you , that &apos;s also very exciting results .
since this time we have found much more about these cells .
we can install it fre@@ eze and later .
we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example at Park@@ inson &apos;s .
but our dream is still always to im@@ pet@@ us to humans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really hope that I can show you soon as the human brain gives us the means to heal himself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you very much .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Jo@@ cel@@ y@@ ne , this is wonderful , I &apos;m sure that just now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who need this . &quot;
I definitely go .
of course , the question is what the greatest obstacles are before you can start clinical studies on humans .
Jo@@ cel@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results you need to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to run this kind of studies .
BG : it is under@@ stand@@ able , the brain is very del@@ ik@@ at etc .
J@@ B : Yes , but there &apos;s a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team .
BG : take a look at the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to launch of clinical trials . if you go further into the future , how many years it lasts until someone can come into the hospital , and this medication will be available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s difficult to say .
first it depends on the approval of the clinical study .
will we allow the authority to start it soon ?
then one must perform this study with a small group of patients .
it already needs a long time to select the patient to perform treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to do this type of treatment .
then you must apply to a multifunctional study .
you have to really prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : natural .
BG : Jo@@ cel@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting T@@ ED and that you have told us of it .
BG : thank you very much .
democracy . to democracy .
we make a great mistake in the West , having a course of course .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t see democracy not as the frag@@ ile plant , which is in reality , but as an inventory of our society . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we tend to consider them as un@@ changeable emot@@ ion .
we believe capitalism leads to democracy .
that is not right .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and its great im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing have no doubt that it is quite possible to have a blo@@ oming capitalism and impressive growth , while the policy remains un@@ democratic .
in fact , democracy is dis@@ appears with us in Europe .
at the beginning of the year , when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was declared unto me as the Minister of Finance in the Euro@@ group -- our elections -- not the au@@ ster@@ ity programs influence , which were realized in Greece .
in this moment I thought that there could be no better just@@ ification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my ref@@ res@@ our@@ able friends that told me that the democracy would be abolished if it would change anything .
in this place , I would like to imagine a public model for a real democracy .
I would like to believe together with me that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group of a mistake , we could save the democracy , but that we need a tru@@ thful and def@@ ensive democracy .
for without democracy , our companies are common , our future is dim and our great , new technologies are w@@ asted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the topic of waste I would like to refer to an interesting contra@@ diction which currently uses our economic activity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I call the &quot; twin summit par@@ ad@@ ox &quot; .
a summit is known to you . they know and recognize him as the debt , who casts its long shadow over the USA , Europe , and the whole world .
we all recognize the debt of the debt ,
but only few recognize his dy@@ mus .
a mountain of un@@ used cash , which belongs to the se@@ al@@ ant savings and corpor@@ ations , however , to invest it would be able to invest , and also all the things might be able to produce the debt , such as &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
over the past 3 months , 3.4 trillion U.S. dollars were invested in the United States , in all the wealth of producing goods , such as industrial equipment , machines , office buildings , schools , streets , equipment , so on and so on .
3.4 trillion U.S. dollar sounds a lot of money , until one compar@@ es it with the 5.1 trillion U.S. dollars , which are at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing , except the stock markets and the real estate prices .
thus , debts and un@@ productive capital form the twin summit that are not affected by the usual market mechanisms .
the results are stag@@ n@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 year olds in the United States , Japan and Europe , and therefore they are able to invest a low demand in which they could not invest in which they would not kill him , that his son would kill him when he is growing ,
the circumstances caused un@@ wanted to carry the circumstances that Ö@@ di@@ pus kill him .
that is my hair with capitalism --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his extremely specific capital was to be used to improve our lives , developing and effectively finance human talents and particularly all the technologies , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
is democracy so the solution ?
I think about it . but before we continue , what do we understand among democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the society form , controlling the free and the arms as a majority of the government .
ath@@ en@@ ical democracy , of course , too many , --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
however , it would be a mistake to minim@@ ize the importance of ath@@ en@@ ical democracy due to these expres@@ sions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decisive point of the ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was that they gave the working arms , but is not only the right to freedom of expression , but important and crucial to them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have the right to political &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; issues relating to political parties &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ath@@ en@@ ical democracy is not long kept --
like a candle that sh@@ ines very bright , it is quickly hat@@ ched .
however , our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies have not their roots in the ancient Athens ,
but at Magna Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American Constitution .
while the ath@@ en@@ ical democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working arms , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Cart@@ a which ultimately was a statute for the ruling .
for the liberal democracy first came up only when a complete separation of politics and economy is possible and the democratic process was bound for politics , whereas the economy -- so the world of the concert -- a democracy @-@ free zone .
in our current demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time , in which this separation of politics and economy began , an in@@ her@@ edit@@ ary struggle between the two , by taking the economy gradually dis@@ fe@@ as@@ ible .
are you wonder@@ ing why the politicians are no longer than before ?
it is not possible at a de@@ generation of their DNA .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is due that we can be in the government today and nevertheless not in power because the power is derived from politics into the economy and the areas are separated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I mentioned my Ha@@ che with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is about such as a herd of smo@@ kers , which are so sustainable the animals , of whom they nour@@ ished , dec@@ im@@ ated that they are hungry at the end .
similarly , it is similar to the economy that affects the policy so far @-@ causing economic crisis itself . the power of corpor@@ ations is increasing , economic demand falls , and the managing director of companies are to be changed to invest in cash of their companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; demo@@ s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &#91; the people &#93; extracted from democracy , the higher the twin summit , and the excess of human labour power and pro@@ sper@@ ity of humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if this is true , it is obvious that we must res@@ ili@@ ze the politics and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; demo@@ s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ret@@ ains control , apart from the exclusion of the slaves , women and foreigners . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a new idea .
the Marx@@ ist Lin@@ ke had already left this idea 100 years ago and did not strange .
the doctrine of Deb@@ ac@@ el of the Soviet Union should be that the working arms should only obtain a position like in ancient Athens without creating new types of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is a solution : the working arms !
capitalism does it , by replacing low @-@ wage employed by automation and robot .
the problem is to be so long the economy and politics of separate areas , the automation makes the twin summit , so how it is very soon as I think -- in countries like China .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to re@@ design the economy and the fields of economy and politics again , and thereby compl@@ ying that we will democr@@ at@@ tract the re@@ unified field of surveillance , otherwise we will show the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a documentary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the question is not whether the capitalism has brought up the technical achievements , which he has to survive --
the most interesting question is whether the capitalism is replaced by a D@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to the &quot; Star Tre@@ k , &quot; in which machines will serve people , or into a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ ener &quot; Ag@@ ora , &quot; in long talks about the meaning of life .
I think we must be optim@@ istic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what would it happen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such utop@@ ia instead of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; -@@ similar D@@ yst@@ op@@ ia &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in practical implementation I would like to give you some examples in the future .
in the field of companies : please ask for a capital market , where you work money , while you work and in which your capital is for the next , and the company -- no matter which one has just works -- is property of those who currently work in the company .
then all income from capital and proceeds from Er@@ trig@@ gers and the concept of wage work is completely over@@ hau@@ led .
no distinction between those who belong to companies , but they do not work therein , and employees who do not work there , but there are no di@@ ver between capital and labour , no large g@@ aps between investment and spo@@ res , and ultimately won &apos;t exceed the twin summit .
in the area of global political economy , please indicate that our national currencies could have a free fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , which is issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interest of whole humanity .
imagine that the entire world trade will be tra@@ ded in this currency , we call &quot; the cos@@ mos , &quot; in units of &quot; Kos@@ mos &quot; &apos; -- and every government pay the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or trade excess of the country in a joint fund .
imagine that this fund has invested in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world , in which investment funds are ra@@ r .
this is no new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes had suggested in the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference of 1944 .
the problem was that one did not implement the technical resources at that time .
today we have , especially in the background of a restored politics and business .
the world , which I describe you is con@@ ferred at the same time , in which they privileg@@ ed people , and mar@@ x@@ ist@@ ically , because she is buried the separation of capital and work in the tr@@ ash@@ can of history , and key@@ n@@ as@@ ian , globally key@@ n@@ as@@ ian .
but above all others , it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy .
are we awak@@ ening in such a world
or will we drop in a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar D@@ yst@@ op@@ ia sin@@ king ?
the response depends on how we decide to work together polit@@ ically .
it is in our hands , and we do it better .
thank you .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Y@@ an@@ is ...
you are in your biography itself as liber@@ ate Marx@@ ists .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Y@@ an@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if any of what I have just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant .
the reason for re@@ unification of politics and business ... do we do not know that the technological development will produce a massive decrease in overall economic demand , which is called Larry sum@@ mers as &quot; long @-@ term stag@@ nation . &quot;
through the transfer of this crisis in a part of the earth to the next , as we can experience it , it will not only dest@@ abil@@ ize our democracy , but also the countries whose interest is limited to liber@@ ally democracy .
if this is true , Marx is quite relevant ,
as Hay@@ ek , that &apos;s why I am a liberal Marx@@ ist , and as Key@@ nes , and therefore I am perfectly active .
BG : actually , and now we are well .
Y@@ V : if you do not work , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosoph@@ ical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually , it was Einstein , who said . BG : in your talk , you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday when dinner of the speakers have you really told what you think from the point of view to China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a large number of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liber@@ als demo@@ cra@@ cies we have the note of democracy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I said in my lecture , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We have limited the democracy to politics , whereas the sector plays , the most part of the economy -- a fully @-@ democratic zone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a sense when I have this pro@@ voc@@ ative , China is similar to China today to the 19th century England .
for -- let &apos;s recall -- We tend to combine liber@@ alism with democracy -- that &apos;s a mistake , histor@@ ically .
liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , as John Stuart Mill --
he was especially sk@@ ep@@ tical , regarding the democratic development .
what one can watch now in China , resem@@ bles very the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
now to rule China now to do what the West has done in the 19th century , sm@@ ells powerful according to hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I &apos;m sure that many people are curious about your experiences as the Minister of Finance of Greece beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I informed that this is coming .
BG : Yes ...
how do you look back six months later for the first half year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal view , and very dis@@ appointing because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone ,
not only Greece , but the Eurozone ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; namely , to say good@@ bye to compl@@ ac@@ ency , and to den@@ ying that a massive amount line through the Eurozone ran off and continues to ampli@@ fy the development of the whole European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we had the opportunity to establish the first proposal by the way , the first proposal that den@@ i@@ fies these things --
unfortunately it is right to do . unfortunately , the powers were within the Eurozone , within the European group , continues to den@@ ial .
but you know what comes .
this is the experience from the Soviet Union --
if one tries to keep an economic system that is not su@@ vi@@ able to receive through political will and authorization of life , one may occur in a while , but when the change occurs , it happens ab@@ rupt@@ ly and destroyed .
BG : which change do you advance ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future if we do not change its setup .
BG : have you made any mist@@ akes in your time as the Minister of Finance ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- harvest juice ...
if there is a Minister of Finance , or any minister , who is in office after 6 months in office , especially in an so @-@ called situation , claims that he had no mist@@ akes , then it is a dangerous person .
of course I made mist@@ akes .
the largest error was to sign the request for the extension of the debt program at the end of February .
I believed that there was an hon@@ est interest on pages of the don@@ ors to find a common solution .
but this did not do .
they only wanted to bring back our government , only because they would not want to deal with the indications that they ran through the euro zone .
they would not have collap@@ sed that they have been cat@@ ast@@ roph@@ ic program for 5 years in Greece .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is worse than the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Depression &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
no one of the tro@@ ika of the wal@@ let , which has imposed us this policy , is a : &quot; that was an col@@ os@@ ano@@ int mist@@ akes . &quot;
BG : despite all that , and despite the aggressive t@@ ons of the convers@@ ations , you seem to be just a European @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
my cr@@ iti@@ que of the European Union and the Eurozone is in contrast to someone who lives and loves Europe .
my greatest fear is that the Eurozone is not survived .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for when it is not survi@@ ves , all the charges shall be eradi@@ cated , and destroy the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will not have disast@@ rous consequences for Europe , but for the entire world economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we pursue ourselves the way of a post modern 1930 , after that it appears to me , it will also be considered to be the future of Europeans like the non @-@ Europeans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : we hope you are very happy to lie in this point .
Y@@ an@@ is , thank you very much for you were at T@@ ED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
by Roy Price , most of them have never heard even though he probably is responsible for the moderate @-@ hour of your life on April 19 , 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entert@@ aining minutes , but not for many of you .
this goes back to the decision that the Roy arrived three years ago .
Roy Price is senior employee at Amazon Studios ,
the TV production company from Amazon .
he is 47 years old , slim , has a fresh fr@@ ur and describes herself on Twitter as &quot; films , TV , technique , Tac@@ os . &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for the shows and the content that will produce Amazon .
of course , this is a very hard fighting sector .
there are so many TV @-@ series that Roy can &apos;t select anything .
he must find shows that are very , very good .
in other words , he must find shows that are located quite right at this curve .
this curve is the evaluation process of over 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the evaluation is from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this review will receive .
if your show is nine and higher , this will be a winner .
then one has a successful show .
these are shows as &quot; Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that ad@@ dic@@ tive , where , after you have seen a season , your brain asks : &quot; where are there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this type of show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the left hand side , here are shows how &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- that &apos;s what you should say anything at that end of the curve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy Price does not work on the left side of the curve , because I think you already need special intelligence in order to accommodate &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
he makes more thoughts about the average out@@ patient , the average television -- the shows that neither good nor bad , they are simply beautiful .
thus , he must ensure that it is really on the right side .
the pressure is present , and of course it is the first time that Amazon is something like this , so Roy Price does not want to risk .
he wants to create successes .
he needs a guaranteed success , so he keeps a competition .
he takes a lot of ideas for TV shows and elec@@ ts eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of this shows and presents them online , where they can watch each free of charge .
and if Amazon is going out free for free , do you still feel right ?
millions of viewers see this episodes .
however , they don &apos;t know that they are watching the shows of this shows .
they are observed by Roy and his team to record all these things .
when you register when the show starts , when you &apos;re p@@ au@@ sible , what parts you jumps and check again .
you collect millions of data to decide to decide which show you should produce them .
in fact , they collect the data , process these and from it yields the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com over four republi@@ can U.S. trans@@ itions . &quot;
they made this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; Yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alpha House , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it seems that not many of them can remember the show because it wasn &apos;t so good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s only an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the Word -- since the average of this curve 7,4 is 7.4 -- and Alpha House arrives at 7.5 -- so slightly above average , but not exactly what else by Roy and his team .
about the same time in another company has another manager creates a top @-@ show through data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy is always searching for this a super show and he uses data for it , but it does something different .
instead of running a competition , he and his team have looked on the existing data about Net@@ fli@@ x spectators , thus the reviews that they give the shows , which shows her gigs , etc .
then they ut@@ ili@@ ze these data to find out these little details about the spectators : which shows they like what producers , which actors .
when they had together all the parts they went a car , and decided to do not a Sit@@ com over four transmitters , but a drama series about an Senator .
do you know this show ?
Yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has hit one hit , at least for the first two seasons .
house of Cards &quot; gets a 9,1 rating on this curve . so exactly there where they wanted .
of course , is the question : what happened here ?
one has two very competent , data experienced firms .
they connect these many data and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is this about ?
because logic was sur@@ som@@ eh@@ ow that that should work with everything .
if you collect millions of data , for a decision to meet you , then you should make a good choice .
it has 200 years of statistics as a back @-@ up .
we are optimized with very powerful computer .
the least what you can expect is good television , or ?
if data analysis is so wrong , this is quite strange because we live in a time , in which we continue to attack more and more to make serious decisions , far beyond television .
does anyone know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
nobody . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that nobody ever comes in contact with this software . come in contact , you are in prison .
if someone asks here in the United States and asking for release , it is likely to determine whether the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dis@@ mis@@ sal is given or not .
just like with Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but rather than decide whether a show is good or bad , it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad .
moderate television , 22 minutes that can be really bad , but more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that these data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results . this is not aware that a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
even the dates of the most diversi@@ fied companies are wrong .
Yes , even Google can make mist@@ akes .
in 2009 , Google announced that it can be caused by data analysis out@@ breaks of flu , the worst kind of data analysis -- by data analysis of the Google research .
it worked mira@@ cul@@ ously and was a great news station . the success was cul@@ min@@ ated in a publication in the journal Nature &quot; magazine .
it worked perfectly , year about year , until it suddenly didn &apos;t work anymore ,
and no one could say why .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it just didn &apos;t work , this was once again a sens@@ ation , including the re@@ vocation of the publication &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nature &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the dat@@ ast@@ er@@ able companies such as Amazon and Google has sometimes mis@@ understood something .
despite all these errors , data in the decisions of the life include a -- at the workplace , in which the en@@ forcement is in medicine .
so , we should rather make sure that data are helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in the computer @-@ assisted genet@@ ics -- a field where some very wise man should use un@@ imag@@ in@@ able many data to make serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy
or the development of a drug . over the years I recognized a few patterns on the difference between successful decisions by using data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be dissem@@ inated .
ever , you have to solve a complex problem , do mainly in two things :
as gran@@ dest of this problem , you can analyse this problem , so that you can analyse the single parts ; as a result of the individual parts you put together to hold a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : apart and set up again .
and now the most important : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only be able to dis@@ assem@@ ble a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to comp@@ ile the parts again and then come to a decision .
there is another tool and we all have : our brain .
if there &apos;s something , when the brain is good , it is parts and pieces again put together , even if the information is un@@ complete , in order to hold a good conclusion -- especially when the brain is an expert .
therefore , I believe that Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they &apos;ve used data and understanding , where they also belong to the process .
you can use the data to understand their audience , for which otherwise it would not have been able to dis@@ assem@@ ble all these parts , and how to make all these parts , and there is no show such as &quot; House of Cards &quot; which did not stand in the data .
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , which meant that they entered a large personal risk with this decision .
Amazon , on the other hand , did the wrong way .
they used to control all their decisions , first as they voted by TV ideas as they voted &quot; Alpha House &quot; as show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe decision because they could always say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we say the data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data are helpful for better cho@@ ices , but I think that things going wrong when data start to control our decisions .
no matter how ma@@ cht@@ ing them are , data is only one tool , and in order to forget that this device is quite useful .
many of you will ...
before it was data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions by means of a Ja@@ ime or no @-@ question you must shake only the ball about . &quot; most likely &quot; -- exactly here in this moment .
I &apos;m going to be later with a technology demo .
I have met some decisions in my life , with which I should have list@@ ened to the ball .
but , as you can , of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace them through something much dis@@ covering , such as data analysis to make better cho@@ ices .
but this does not change the foundations .
for example , the ball will be cl@@ ashed and cl@@ ashed . finally , there is no decision to meet decisions if we want to achieve something exceptional at the end of the right curve .
and I feel good as very encour@@ aging news that it will always be able to make decisions in spite of the great amount of data , an expert in which you do , and risks to enter risks .
because at the end , it is not the data but the risks involved with which you were at the right end of the curve .
thank you beautiful .
