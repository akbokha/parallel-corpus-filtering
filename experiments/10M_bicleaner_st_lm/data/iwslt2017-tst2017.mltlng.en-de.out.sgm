<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him maybe because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times-reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">For a long before someone listened to Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book, in which he spectacular released that the NSA's illegal phones are heard by Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is a different chapter, which should leave a permanent impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this he describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation in which the CIA had literally overthrown to Iran for a nuclear bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If it sounds crazy, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who didn't really liked the chapter at all?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For almost 10 years, the government filed against Risen and called him to call his alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this train, he was ordained as a symbol for the design of the government, Whistleblower, and journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the first Constitutional Court, the media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right, if media doesn't receive this information, and if they can't protect the identity of the courageous they give.</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government arrived at Risen, he did something that many courageous reporters were already before him: he refused and said that he would prefer to go into prison.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015, Risen was still living with the risk to go into prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, only days before the process, happened something unusual.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly, even though it was necessary for years, they were crucial for their case, the demands of the government were dropped.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time electronic monitoring, the reporters and sources can always have to hide.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of fails and centives to fulfil, this also could do his digital footsteps for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And then the investigator have not worried about his understanding, his telephone numbers,</seg>
<seg id="21">As well as his e-mail data, financial and bankindly information, its credit balance, and even travel documents with the list of its flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of these information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA-Whistleblower and Risens source.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately, this is just one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect Whistleblower by his arrival, but instead the judiciary has condemned more than all US governments in front of him.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "now you can imagine what a problem can be, especially because the government is involved much from their work as gehome." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, almost every article on national security was the result of that a Whistleblower went to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "" "" "we therefore put the press work on the game that should be protected by the first Constitutional Treaty, because the government has always more possibilities to increase all." ""</seg>
<seg id="28">But just as the technology of the government allows to bypass the rights of Reporters, the press can also use technologies to protect their sources better.</seg>
<seg id="29">And indeed they can pick up from the moment in which they contact us, rather than in the night, in the testimony.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today there are communication software that it still didn't have to be, when Risen had written his book, and it is much more secure than normal e-mails or telephone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such a technology is a SecureDrop, an open source crossing system designed by Aaron Swartz, which was originally developed by us and has been working today by the Freedom of the Press Foundation.</seg>
<seg id="32">Rather than send an e-mail, go to a news website, such as the Washington Post here.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send documents, such as in any ordinary contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These will then be encrypted and stored on a server, which has access the relevant news agency.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government does not expose more information secretly, and many of the information that would like to request it would not be available in advance.</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments around the world still develop new spy technologies that all are at risk.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "it's" "" "It's" "" "it is not only that the supplier of technology such as Edward Snowden offer an opportunity to protect miscellaneous abuse." "" "it is important that we protect the next Whistleblower." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The alarm against abuse of soldiers in the supply of soldiers who wants to report from overcrowded hospitals. or to the next environmental worker, the alarm to the sighted water of Flint. or a Wallwall-Insider who warned us before the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, these technologies were not only made for those who want to cover crime, but to protect all of the constitutional rights.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on April 3, 2016 the largest data leck of history was published.] [what does this mean?] [what does this mean?] [what does this mean?] [what does this week have been hidden by News about a Leck of 11 million documents of the local law firm Mospack Fonseca</seg>
<seg id="43">Publication of these documents have a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">We get an impression how customers, banks and lawyers are going to companies such as Mosbag Fonseca and say: "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set it up?"</seg>
<seg id="45">We really see the e-mails, the exchange of messages, how the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to the first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland Prime Minister has withdrawn.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that an alliance of the brutal Syrian dictator Bar al-Assad, which has been signed at tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">It claims that a track of 2 billion US dollars on Russia's president Vladimir Putin is leading to a close friend of children's days, a famous Cellists.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of rich people and others give the nervous about the next release, and to the next revealed documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">It sounds like the plot of one agency's house or a John-Grisham-ROM.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems to be a cry of you, to me the ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should this be?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: if the rich and Mighty is able to hide their fortune in tax havases and not all of their taxes, then it means less funds for important public services such as healthcare, education, and roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And this affects us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">Throughout the world, media and leading politicians, such as secret tax havens are used by some few, to hide and disclose their assets -- something that we have been discussing and uncover for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">"" "" "" "I think many people will be very confusing this whole world, and it is difficult to understand how this tax havases work." ""</seg>
<seg id="59">I always place it like a Matrjoshkapi.</seg>
<seg id="60">So, in another company, in another company, in another company what makes it almost impossible to understand, who is behind this prayer.</seg>
<seg id="61">It may be very difficult for prosecuting and tax authorities, as well as journalists or civil society really understand what is the matter.</seg>
<seg id="62">I think it is interesting that there is less reports about this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">Probably, because there are no prominent American Americans that came in these revelations, in this scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">"" "" "" "well, it is not so that there are no more rich Americans to hide their fortune in tax havens." ""</seg>
<seg id="65">But by the principle, after which these tax havens work, Mospack Fonseca has less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">Could we have a dleck of the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, it is so that in some U.S. states, less information needs to specify less information to found a company than to get a librID card.</seg>
<seg id="68">"" "this type of Intransparent in the US has allowed the employees from school districts," "" "school children" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="69">It has more ruffed, especially vulnerable cheeses.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this type of behavior, which affects us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at the Global Witness, we'll need to figure out how all this is in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a secret investigation into the offices of 13 companies in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigations gave himself as an African minister, who wanted to bring the suspected money to the United States to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">It really shocked it that all until an advocate from our investigations, how he could transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">All of these lawyers were all preferences. none of these lawyers accepted us as a client and of course there was no man to get there money. however it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this not as individual cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not going to give a certain lawyer, who presented our secret investigator suggestions.</seg>
<seg id="79">It is not dealing with a single top of polishes, wrapped in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">It's how the system works, through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability are being established.</seg>
<seg id="81">And to handle this, we must change the rules of rules.</seg>
<seg id="82">We must change the rules to make this type of behavior difficult.</seg>
<seg id="83">This may all be very angry when we could do anything else; as if nothing had changed anything, it's always the wealwealthy and Mighty One.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as borrowed Optimus, I really see that a lot has begun to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">In the past few years we have seen signs to greater transparency, which concerns the owners of companies.</seg>
<seg id="86">The theme found political attention by the British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="87">Ever since then, the EU has been grouped in central registers on the national level, who is really behind companies in Europe, and who controls them.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US will leave behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties have taken a bill in both Parliament's chambers, but this makes not the progress that we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how this Panama's revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, used as resources to ensure greater transparency in the US and global.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us, at Global Witness, this is a moment for changes.</seg>
<seg id="92">"" "" "" "we need common people who are mad when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind headlights." ""</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "we need Directors in the business, standing and say:" "" "Intransparent is not good for the business" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">We need leading politicians that recognize the problem and deploy themselves through the laws of this kind of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="95">Together we can end the Intransparent, which now makes this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering, finally complete.</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story, as I was almost abducted and in the trunk of a red Mazdas would be.</seg>
<seg id="97">A day after I finished my design studies, I made a rear shop.</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the Mazda was left and looked down my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and made a road trip to the whole country. afterwards he would go to the peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "while we paid the invoice, I made the mistakes to ask him," "" "Where do you sleep today?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">He did the whole thing even worse: "I don't know it."</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought: "Oh, man!</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer sleeping space now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just didn't know it! he says he would go to the peace corps, but I don't know if he really plans. I don't want to lie down in the boot of a Mazdas!</seg>
<seg id="110">That's a small car boot!</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "then I heard me," "" "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "a voice in my head said," "" "How please?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">Night I was in bed, I was stared to the ceiling, I thought, "Oh! what haven't I jumped to me?</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild adult sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">"" "what if he is crazy?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="116">I got a fear that I went out of bed, at the tia-pointed to the door, and closed my sleep door.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not mad.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in touch.</seg>
<seg id="119">The artwork, which he had bought from me today depends on his classroom. he is a teacher now.</seg>
<seg id="120">That was my first experience as a host. it has completely changed my viewing angle.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood have been sold, actually, friends who were waiting for it?</seg>
<seg id="122">People on my air mattress was to accommodate me. it was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress.</seg>
<seg id="123">We make a leap, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I am jobless, almost pleite, my roommate draws up and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that there had been a design conference at that time. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think, creativity can do it, fear in fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote my best friend and new fellow countrymen Brian Chesky: "Brian, I could bring it to a designer-bed-and-breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk including breakfast, a mattress and every morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a site and founded such a "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were able to sleep for 20 dollars on air mattresses on wooden floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it great, and we also found.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure to decorate our cheese ham and cheese. completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured them through the whole city. as we did our last guest, and at the door to the castle, Brian and I joined us.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we could find new friends and we were able to pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">The things came into rolls.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out how to make a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">So we presented to the investors: "we want to create a site, on the people public images of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their homes -- the kind of rooms whose doors one closes when you come by.</seg>
<seg id="139">Over the Internet, they can invite wild people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">This will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited that the missile had been ignited.</seg>
<seg id="142">But she did not.</seg>
<seg id="143">No one who is still in consolation, would invest in a business, which allows foreigners to sleep in apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">"" "" "" "because we have learned to all children, strangers are dangerous." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="146">If you have a problem, you explain to things that can be good. we were designed to design.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Academy of Fine Arts, we learned that design is much more than just look and haptik -- it's the overall life.</seg>
<seg id="148">We had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create trust through design, among people who had never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design be so anything?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create with design confidence?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a sample, which degree trust we moved.</seg>
<seg id="152">It's a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort one.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up if you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone in your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Enter your entlock mobile phone on your left seat.</seg>
<seg id="157">This silent suit of panic, which you will feel -- -- is exactly what hosts will feel when they open the door first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">For the only thing that is still personal as your mobile, is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your text, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to keep the unlocked mobile phone of a foreigner in the hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">So, most guests feel when they are somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only this reason, our company may exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Only so, who actually has Al Gores cell now?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you preach the Twitter that it should be elected to the president of the president?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can return the cell phone now.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I would like to tell you of some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a small detail in this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor would have been presented once again with his name; if he would have told what he comes, like his dog or his children?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine, you might have 150 convictions that say: "he can really hold fast the mobile phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel then if you would have to give your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">The trust also strengthens the confidence of a well-perate feedback system.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning, we have made some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard to abandon people's negatives.</seg>
<seg id="175">Finally, we decided to wait for both hosts and guest their findings, before we presented them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We studied with Stanford a study. we examined how likely it is that people trust in each other as they are similar to age and residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">"" "little surprisingly, we trust the people most, who are most like the most like." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less trust we.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social security engineer.</seg>
<seg id="181">Exciting, if you add the call of a person -- in our case by appraisal.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have fewer than three convictions, there is nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But it has more than ten, changes all.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation is common similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">So, the correct design can help us to overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">Moreover, we drove that confidence is dependent on it, how much one gives off.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first news of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "if you tell a little bit, like" "" "Hi!" "", "you don't get any answer." ""</seg>
<seg id="189">"" "one tells you too much, such as:" "" "I have problems with my mother" "" "--" "" "-- the request is also not accepted." ""</seg>
<seg id="190">"" "there is therefore an optimal degree of openness, for example" "" "Tolle Artwork" "" "in your apartment! I'm doing with my family holiday." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="191">How can you create it with design to create these degrees in Openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct quantity text. we also give tips to what subjects should write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">"" "" "" "our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help to overcome our advantages against foreigners." ""</seg>
<seg id="194">With which we did not reckoned, the great amount of people who were more than ready to lay down these advantages.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people take our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can recognize three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: incredibly good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Secondly, the untiring work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third: a need that was not covered before.</seg>
<seg id="200">The shop is just very good for us.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course, there's also times if not everything goes smooth.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have been celebrated parties celebrated or devastated homes.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts must have guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked on customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I got at the front when confidence is broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it already hurting when I think only.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointments, which listens to the voice of the anus, was and will always be our biggest motivation to improve us further.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately, only a fraction was one problem of the 123 million overnight stays.</seg>
<seg id="209">For people confided one to another.</seg>
<seg id="210">When confidence is working, wondrous works are created.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holidays in Uruguay. he suffered a heart attack there.</seg>
<seg id="212">His hosts went into the hospital.</seg>

<seg id="276">No, not as homosexual man, as some of my friends but as Muslim. I decided to bear the Hijab, my head cover.</seg>
<seg id="277">My feminist friends were astonished: "why do you afflict yourself?"</seg>
<seg id="278">The Lusty was: at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence, namely with the pressure that I felt as 17-year-old, give me a perfect and unachievable beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only accepted the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have clustered with Koran.</seg>
<seg id="281">I read it, thought after the question, doubted and believed last.</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship to God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was confidence and slow devotion, which deepened with each reading of the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of rhythmik bring me sometimes to the wines.</seg>
<seg id="285">I acknowledge myself in it. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">Had you ever feel the feeling that someone doesn't perceive you? is it somehow like that somehow like?</seg>
<seg id="287">So it feels.</seg>

<seg id="300">Oh my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">It is not only that my country was attacked, but in the Nu converted me the deeds of another by a civil war into a suspects.</seg>
<seg id="302">That same day we had to go through the Central West of the USA to draw back into a new city and start the postgraduate course.</seg>
<seg id="303">I remember - as we knew -- as we were silent -- so deep it went into my seat, and I feared the first time when Muslims are recognized.</seg>
<seg id="304">We moved to our apartment in this night, in a new city, where it felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">"" "and then I heard and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said:" "" "be careful," "" "Do not be careful in good fighting," "" "not deceived you." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="309">I saw my extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">The feelings were understandably, and I heard of attacks on Muslims or of people who had stayed for Muslims who destroyed and struck down.</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really aggies on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something did not feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because people who had attacked this country had attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">I pushed the rage of people to terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was too angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to explain itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">I have nothing against questions, I love questions.</seg>
<seg id="319">These are the allegations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">Nowadays we can actually hear people: "there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we go? "</seg>
<seg id="322">People want to beat Muslims and mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak about my congregation, like a tumor in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">It is only the question: are we malignant or good?</seg>
<seg id="325">You know: a malignant tumor is removed as a whole and a good tumor is under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">Muslims are, like all other Americans, no tumor in the body of the USA, but an important organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventor and teachers, narrofer and Olympik Risks.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the locking of mosques America do more secure?</seg>
<seg id="331">There may be a couple of parking lots but not stop the terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">Regular visits to a mosque manages to consider people with other faith more tolerant, and greater civil participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as I told me a ladder in the Washington area, DC recently told: people are actually not allocalized in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their cellar or bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">During the radio process, it is found that he begins online. as a result, the person's person has been cut off, even from their family that the terrorists are taking true Muslims, and everyone who abhors their behavior and their ideology, is a traitor or belief.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent radicalization, we must keep the people to keep the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some are still in claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group such as the IS had its brutality with the Quran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As Muslim, mother, as man, I believe that we must do everything to stop a group as the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would like to put us in their performance world when they recognize them as a representative of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku-club-Klan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology reasons on their "Holy Book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"" "but when you saw a look at it, they don't drive them up what they had" "" "Holy Scriptures" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is her brood, which they can read these things in the Scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding impression told me recently an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him, because they came to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked if they had been in contact with radial religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said, the problem was the opposite. any clergy with whom she had spoken, she brought her away to silence, and said her to her mind for unrighteousness in the world, only in trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">"" "" "" "of nothing inspires and something that had given her anger, she was a main goal for instrumentalisation by extremists who promised a solution." ""</seg>
<seg id="351">"" "" "" "this imam turned the connection to God and its church again." ""</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of working for her anger, he showed her constructive ways for a real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she met in the mosque, she kept them before joining the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">That was an insight, like the Islamophobia and affecting my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect every other?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of anxiety every day on our democracy, to our freedom of thoughts?</seg>
<seg id="358">A study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show: if we fear us, at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">We rather accept an authorized governmental system, conformity and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="360">One study shows: if one reports a test subjects, in which negative was reported on Muslims, they represent more military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">When you look, when the mood for Muslims were up in relation to Muslims -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It was in advance of the Iraq war and during the two-day periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So, Islamophobia is not simply the natural response to Muslim terrorism, as I expected it.</seg>
<seg id="365">It can actually be a tool for manipulating the public to acquire the foundation of a free society, the sensible and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We perhaps feel it as the first, but the toxic air of the fear gives us all.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the assignment of collective bonds it is not only to explain himself to himself.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was a sportsmen.</seg>
<seg id="371">He was involved in the dental faculty, talented, of promising...</seg>
<seg id="372">His sister would say to me that he was the sweet, a generous person whom she knew.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him and he showed her curriculum. she was amazing and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"when ever happened to my breasts such an experienced young man?"</seg>
<seg id="375">Just a few weeks after visiting Suzanne for her brother and his wife, Craig Stephen Hicks, she was murdered, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan who visited the afternoon. he did it in her apartment, as with a execution after he had posted beats against Muslims on his Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="376">He shot eight times on Deah.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanaticism can not only be fatal, but also deadly.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Are we gone to the mosque, or we stayed safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">We besought it and for us it was not a light decision, because it was therefore that America we want to leave our children: one that would control us through fear, or one in which we can exercise our religion.</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in child's seat, we moved to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took him out, and my shoes went out, went into the building hall, and what I saw, let me hold.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the imam made a announcement, and was welcomed our guests, because half of the meetings were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, Atheists, believers and non-believers who came not to attack us, but by us.</seg>
<seg id="387">In this moment I am collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there, as they had courage and compassion panic, and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What are you going to choose the fear and fanaticism at the moment?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you go on number safe?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you join them that are my: we are better than those who are.</seg>
<seg id="393">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thank you beautiful!</seg>
<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have hit a Nerve.</seg>
<seg id="396">But I wonder what you say that you might say that you're talking a TEDTalk, a monument with draught work, thus an exception and not the rule.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">Dalia Mogahed: I would say that you don't think. I'm totally normal.</seg>
<seg id="399">I am no exception.</seg>
<seg id="400">My story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="401">I am so usual, as it is allowed.</seg>
<seg id="402">If one can look at Muslims in all over the world, and I did that with the largest ever carried out on Muslims in the world, people want normal things.</seg>
<seg id="403">They want to be well-being for the family, they want work and they want to live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So I'm not an exception.</seg>
<seg id="405">If people like an exception to rule, then often the rule is broken, and they are not the exception to rule.</seg>
<seg id="406">HW: thank you. Dalia Mogahed.</seg>
<seg id="407">What a platform for hobbyists began to make one billion business shortly before.</seg>
<seg id="408">Monitoring, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for professional drones. it is made possible in research institutions around the world.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before air-package in our social consciousness, a autonomous fleet of flight machines at the Frac Centre in France was built live in front of the audience a six-metre high tower of 1 500 bricks. some years ago it started to fly with arrows.</seg>
<seg id="410">By connecting the aerodrome, high speed and acceleration of the smallest space can be connected.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build self-levable structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They learned to carry loads, to deal with turbulences and generally respond to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to exceed the limits of possible in autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">So that a system autonom works must know it collective complying, where in the room the mobile objects are located.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our lab at the ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects. this allows us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">We use a new localization technology of Verity Studios, a branch of our laboratories.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the space, calculations on board determine what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "external commands are available in the highest layer. for example," "" "and" "" "land" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called tailstarter,</seg>
<seg id="422">One aircraft, trying to beat two flying with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other starters, it is efficient in the downward flight, much more efficient than helicopters in all their variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">In contrast to most of the starring glers, it can be float, and therefore has great advantages with start and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">But there is always a sweeping page.</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of tailor-starters is that they are sensitive to turbulls like wind turbines.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the device doesn't matter what is capable of recovered position and improves performance by practice.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research, we often ask fundamental abstract questions which lead to the core of cause.</seg>
<seg id="431">Such a question would be: what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There is practical reasons to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known as a machines that are known as machines with a thousand movable parts that I did to violate you.</seg>
<seg id="434">For decades ago, trained pilots could fly-controlled flight units, which only had two moving parts: a propeller and a stern.</seg>
<seg id="435">"" "" "" "unlong discovered we discovered that flies only works with only one." ""</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the Monospinner, the mechanically easiest and remote flight. it was short invented in short.</seg>
<seg id="437">It only has a movable part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No sapping, hinges and transverse lines, no other positions or control surfaces, only one propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although there is mechanically simple, inside life happens very much so that it can fly as stable and can move in the room.</seg>
<seg id="440">Nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear starters. to bring it to flying, I have to throw it exactly right.</seg>
<seg id="441">The likelihood of seeing it exactly right when I see all, is small, therefore I show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening.</seg>
<seg id="442">When the monopoly is an exercise in pleasures, this machine is here, the Omnicopter with its eight propellers, an exercise in overflow.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this overflow?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that he is only symmetrically.</seg>
<seg id="445">Therefore he is ambivalent in his orientation.</seg>
<seg id="446">Thereby he receives the remaining ordinary skill,</seg>
<seg id="447">In the room to move in all directions, no matter what direction he is rotated, or even like it rotates.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of interactive rivers of eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">Some is available in models, the rest is learns directly at the flies.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let us see that.</seg>
<seg id="451">If flight machines are to be part of our everyday life, it must be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine is composed of two separate two-propeller aircraft engines.</seg>
<seg id="453">This turns in clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other about the clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When you build them, they are like a high-performance Quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">But if something wrong -- a motor or propeller falls off, the electronics or a battery -- the machine can continue to fly if also restricted.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will demonstrate it now by making a half airworthy.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration studied synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units facilitates a pallet on aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took commercial micro-Quadcopter -- every single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with localising technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where it is in space and is self-controlled. therefore there is no limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully, you hopefully motivate this demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe machine as drone wants to get a flying lamp screen on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course it is difficult to predictable the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us, the reward in the development and the Schaffner act.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a reminder, how wonderful and magical our universe is, and that it is creative to shape them in so spectacular fashion.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such a massive and economic potential, the bag is on the i.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="469">More than 1.3 billion years ago, in a very far distant galaxy, two black holes are always quicker, you walked so the mass of three lights in a tenth of a second in pure energy.</seg>
<seg id="470">For short moment, they lights brighter than all stars along the galaxies of the entire universe.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big kneeling.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they didn't bring their energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was given into space-time pos ourselves and the universe exploded in gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">We arrange the events initially timely.</seg>
<seg id="476">Just 1.3 billion years ago, the life was formed on Earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Ever since then the earth has brought much: corals, fish, plants, saurier, people and -- God stand up for us with -- even the internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago, a group of particularly courageous -- Rai Weiss decided to build a huge laser detector by Ronald Drever, a gigantic laser detector, which arise out by graviticating black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">The majority kept them crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people saw them as crazy genies, so that the US National Science Foundation was financed their idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of telegger development, design, conception and extremely hard work, they built the detector LIGO: the Laser Interferometer Observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the following period, the precision of LIGO could significantly increased significantly, significantly improved the recognition rate.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore, it is called Advanced LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="484">At the beginning of September 2015 LIGO was launched for a final test run around certain smaller, hard-hard problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On September 14, 2015, only a few days after the start-up of the detector, the gravitality shafts of both colonized black holes through the Earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the goodbye to my father's father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically these were the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">All this, what I worked, is no longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at the MIT. he studied Gravity from black holes and their observatories like LIGO. but what are gravitational waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is an forces in the area of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">When passing the shaft, the space and its entire content will be stretched into one direction and into the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">To illustrative teaching in courses in courses for the theory of relativity, often a really albered dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and dust, stretching and dust."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational waves extremely weak, even ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On 14 September, for example, everyone was stretched by us when gathering of the waves and stretching. the expansion of an average people amounted to 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">This means 20 nulls according to the comma, followed by 1. this is the LIGO employees for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five-kilometer-long laser detector, which is already absurd, it would have to be exactly measured on less than an exchange of the radius of a nuclear-core. this is Grotesk.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text about gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">"" "described Kip Thorne, a co-founder LIGOs, hunting after waves as follows:" "" "the technical difficulties for the construction of such detectors are enormous." ""</seg>
<seg id="503">But physicists are final and with the support of the public, all obstacles are overcome. "</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this in 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to LIGO. Scott claims that LIGO be more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than the things around us: facial features, the size of your phone.</seg>
<seg id="508">That's quite practical. for this way you can produce a picture or a map of things by taking it from several points to feed you around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">With sounds that is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">Therefore it is very hard to produce a picture of things that are particularly important to you:</seg>
<seg id="512">About the face of your child.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead, we listen to certain characteristics, such as clay and height, rhythm and volume to close behind the history.</seg>
<seg id="514">"now Alice" speaks.</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob commends her."</seg>
<seg id="516">"stupidly Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We can do with them any simple images of objects in all.</seg>
<seg id="519">But having regard to changes in amplitude and frequency of waves, we can listen to ourselves their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for LIGO, the measured frequencies are in the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">If we transform the shaft of shaft into all, we can literally hear the universe.</seg>
<seg id="522">The gravitation to listen, can tell us about the collision of two black holes, which my colleague Scott are busy very long.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, non-rotating holes, zircons are simple: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">The two bodies are very quick, sounds the same circled with an additional tone of sound. this is listening to: Wu-wu: amount of:</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of movement, shaped into the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date, which at least I never heard hereafter, I heard the sound of -- SH:... two black holes with each 30 times the solar mass, turning around as fast as the rods of your mixers.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: we read about what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the dichest body in all, one with a mass of 29 tons, the other with a mass of 36 tons, revolve hundreds of times per second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine the forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know it because we heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">It consists of the lead importance of LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="533">LIGO ebnet a totally new way to explore the universe, as never before it was possible.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way we can listen to all sounds and the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">We can not see much in all -- practically or basically --</seg>
<seg id="536">A supernova, for example. I would like to know why masseral stars explode in Supernovae.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. of whom we learned much about the All.</seg>
<seg id="538">The thrilling physical processes can be done in the core, which is hidden behind thousands of iron, carbon and silicon kilometers.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never go through, because this opak are.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitation waves permeates iron, as if it is a transparent glass. the primrose it would like to investigate the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it as the primrose from his own repents.</seg>
<seg id="541">With the help of gravitational waves, it should be possible to reflect back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And the most important thing: I'm optimistic that we have never seen in all things we have never seen, which we will never see. things we can only discover by hearing it.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact LIGO took part in the first attempt of things we did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, a major member of the LIGO project says to this topic: me: the kind of stars that produce black holes, as LIGO they are observed, are the dinosaurs of the universe</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient body from prehistoric times. the black holes are so fucking the Sauerkerky for our archeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">LIGO gives us a completely different viewing angle to the events in all, on the origin of the stars and ultimately, as we went out of that chaos.</seg>

<seg id="798">I know how to change your life from one second to the other, after a heavy stroke, or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For neurosurgery it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low ability to support self-healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a severe injury of the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent, severe disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is the reason why I functional Neurosurge.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve nerve functions by various surgical measures.</seg>
<seg id="804">In certain they have one of the best known, the "deep brain stimulation." thereby, you implanted a electrode deep in the brain to influence the circuits of neurons, so that the neurological function improves.</seg>
<seg id="805">It really is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's fate, who suffered severe tremors and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">But Neuromodulation is not Neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeon is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion, we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help, the brain can help themselves.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was an Senior Physician and worked in the emergency.</seg>
<seg id="813">I often provided patients with skull-trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">"" "you need to imagine that the brain trauma is arbitrary and the brain cell is increasing." ""</seg>
<seg id="815">To save life, one must decrease the skull pressure.</seg>
<seg id="816">For this, sometimes you need to remove a portion of slender mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead, instead of the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyze us with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist, the brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="818">What should I do?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells from this tissues.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is no easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">Found cells from a tissue piece is comparable with all small children that can be taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You need to find the right diet, temperature, moisture and the environments to prosper.</seg>
<seg id="823">That exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts we managed Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked exactly as a stem cell culture. with big green cells, surrounded by small, unmature cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">You may still know from the Biological Lessons that stem cells are unripe, which can transform into every cell type of organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small grooves of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made a further fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very fast.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They were slowly and after a few weeks they died even.</seg>
<seg id="836">So we saw a new, strange cellist population that looked like the stem cells, but was different.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand whence they came.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublectic in-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make 4% of our wholesale fish cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play an important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the stage of the fetus, they ensure the brain in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they keep us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We don't know this.</seg>
<seg id="846">"" "" "" "we believe that it takes part in the healing of the brain, as we can find them in higher concentrations in brain injury." ""</seg>
<seg id="847">But that is not so certain.</seg>
<seg id="848">One thing is however clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We stand before a potential cell source that enables the brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop a experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to take a piece of brain areas out of the non-linguistic area and then the cells accurately did as it did Jean-François</seg>
<seg id="853">And then mark them farther, in order to trace them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">During the last step, we implanted them at the removal of the same individuals.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologist Transplantation -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens when we implanted these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we retreat the same cells in digged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">With the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we were able to work with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario, we planted the cells in a healthy brain and we observed that they were completely lost after several weeks, they would go back home. the room is already occupied, they will not be used there, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario, we added a violation and implanted the same cells and now the cells remained, and they were able to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could watch under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that were implanted.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence that they show, are these little points. these are the cells that we stained in vitro.</seg>
<seg id="863">We could not stop natural.</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells help to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual Dexterity task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take feeder from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made it very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they had achieved a stable Dexterity level, we had the motor motorized in the motor bitex.</seg>
<seg id="869">Then the monkeys have been paralyzed, they could not move their hand anymore.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen in humans, they recovered spontaneously up to a certain degree, just like after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">Patients are paralyzed and then try to recover a certain type of plastic mechanism. they get up to a certain degree, just like the monkey.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were sure that the monkey reached its degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted its own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left, you'll see the monkey, which won't be spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">He can deliver approximately 40% to 50% of its original performance from injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so accurate and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Now you see, when we implanted the cells: the same monkey, two months after the maturation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you, that's also very exciting results.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since this time we have found much more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can install it freeze and later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use them in other neuropathological models, for example at Parkinson's.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still always to impetus to humans.</seg>

<seg id="886">Of course, the question is what the greatest obstacles are before you can start clinical studies on humans.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results you need to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to run this kind of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: it is understandable, the brain is very delikat etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: Yes, but there's a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: take a look at the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to launch of clinical trials. if you go further into the future, how many years it lasts until someone can come into the hospital, and this medication will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's difficult to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First it depends on the approval of the clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will we allow the authority to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then one must perform this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It already needs a long time to select the patient to perform treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to do this type of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">Then you must apply to a multifunctional study.</seg>
<seg id="897">You have to really prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: natural.</seg>

<seg id="905">We believe capitalism leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">That is not right.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and its great imitators in Beijing have no doubt that it is quite possible to have a blooming capitalism and impressive growth, while the policy remains undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">In fact, democracy is disappears with us in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year, when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was declared unto me as the Minister of Finance in the Eurogroup -- our elections -- not the austerity programs influence, which were realized in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">In this moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my refresourable friends that told me that the democracy would be abolished if it would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">In this place, I would like to imagine a public model for a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I would like to believe together with me that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup of a mistake, we could save the democracy, but that we need a truthful and defensive democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">For without democracy, our companies are common, our future is dim and our great, new technologies are wasted.</seg>
<seg id="914">"" "" "" "to the topic of waste I would like to refer to an interesting contradiction which currently uses our economic activity." ""</seg>
<seg id="915">I call the "twin summit paradox".</seg>
<seg id="916">A summit is known to you. they know and recognize him as the debt, who casts its long shadow over the USA, Europe, and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the debt of the debt,</seg>
<seg id="918">But only few recognize his dymus.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash, which belongs to the sealant savings and corporations, however, to invest it would be able to invest, and also all the things might be able to produce the debt, such as "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">Over the past 3 months, 3.4 trillion U.S. dollars were invested in the United States, in all the wealth of producing goods, such as industrial equipment, machines, office buildings, schools, streets, equipment, so on and so on.</seg>
<seg id="922">3.4 trillion U.S. dollar sounds a lot of money, until one compares it with the 5.1 trillion U.S. dollars, which are at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing, except the stock markets and the real estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus, debts and unproductive capital form the twin summit that are not affected by the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The results are stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54 year olds in the United States, Japan and Europe, and therefore they are able to invest a low demand in which they could not invest in which they would not kill him, that his son would kill him when he is growing,</seg>

<seg id="928">Is democracy so the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">I think about it. but before we continue, what do we understand among democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the society form, controlling the free and the arms as a majority of the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">Athenical democracy, of course, too many, --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">However, it would be a mistake to minimize the importance of athenical democracy due to these expressions.</seg>
<seg id="934">"" "" "" "the decisive point of the athenian democracy was that they gave the working arms, but is not only the right to freedom of expression, but important and crucial to them," "" "they have the right to political" "" "issues relating to political parties" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="935">Athenical democracy is not long kept --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle that shines very bright, it is quickly hatched.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, our liberal democracies have not their roots in the ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But at Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American Constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the athenical democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working arms, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta which ultimately was a statute for the ruling.</seg>
<seg id="940">For the liberal democracy first came up only when a complete separation of politics and economy is possible and the democratic process was bound for politics, whereas the economy -- so the world of the concert -- a democracy-free zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">In our current democracies, since the time, in which this separation of politics and economy began, an inhereditary struggle between the two, by taking the economy gradually disfeasible.</seg>
<seg id="942">Are you wondering why the politicians are no longer than before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not possible at a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">"" "" "" "it is due that we can be in the government today and nevertheless not in power because the power is derived from politics into the economy and the areas are separated." ""</seg>

<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is about such as a herd of smokers, which are so sustainable the animals, of whom they nourished, decimated that they are hungry at the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">Similarly, it is similar to the economy that affects the policy so far-causing economic crisis itself. the power of corporations is increasing, economic demand falls, and the managing director of companies are to be changed to invest in cash of their companies.</seg>

<seg id="951">The Marxist Linke had already left this idea 100 years ago and did not strange.</seg>
<seg id="952">The doctrine of Debacel of the Soviet Union should be that the working arms should only obtain a position like in ancient Athens without creating new types of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: the working arms!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it, by replacing low-wage employed by automation and robot.</seg>

<seg id="961">In practical implementation I would like to give you some examples in the future.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the field of companies: please ask for a capital market, where you work money, while you work and in which your capital is for the next, and the company -- no matter which one has just works -- is property of those who currently work in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all income from capital and proceeds from Ertriggers and the concept of wage work is completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="964">No distinction between those who belong to companies, but they do not work therein, and employees who do not work there, but there are no diver between capital and labour, no large gaps between investment and spores, and ultimately won't exceed the twin summit.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the area of global political economy, please indicate that our national currencies could have a free fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, which is issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of 20 largest emerging countries], in the interest of whole humanity.</seg>
<seg id="966">Imagine that the entire world trade will be traded in this currency, we call "the cosmos," in units of "Kosmos" '-- and every government pay the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or trade excess of the country in a joint fund.</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that this fund has invested in "green" technologies, especially in parts of the world, in which investment funds are rar.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is no new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes had suggested in the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944.</seg>

<seg id="972">The world, which I describe you is conferred at the same time, in which they privileged people, and marxistically, because she is buried the separation of capital and work in the trashcan of history, and keynasian, globally keynasian.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all others, it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Are we awakening in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we drop in a "matrix" - similar Dystopia sinking?</seg>
<seg id="976">The response depends on how we decide to work together politically.</seg>

<seg id="1038">By Roy Price, most of them have never heard even though he probably is responsible for the moderate-hour of your life on April 19, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision that the Roy arrived three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is senior employee at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">He is 47 years old, slim, has a fresh frur and describes herself on Twitter as "films, TV, technique, Tacos."</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for the shows and the content that will produce Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course, this is a very hard fighting sector.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV-series that Roy can't select anything.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He must find shows that are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he must find shows that are located quite right at this curve.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the evaluation process of over 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the evaluation is from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this review will receive.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is nine and higher, this will be a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then one has a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">These are shows as "Breaking Bad," "Game of Thrones," "The Wire" -- all the shows that addictive, where, after you have seen a season, your brain asks: "where are there more of these episodes?"</seg>
<seg id="1053">This type of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"" "on the left hand side, here are shows how" "" "Toddlers and Tiaras" "" "-- that's what you should say anything at that end of the curve." ""</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price does not work on the left side of the curve, because I think you already need special intelligence in order to accommodate "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">He makes more thoughts about the average outpatient, the average television -- the shows that neither good nor bad, they are simply beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="1057">Thus, he must ensure that it is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is present, and of course it is the first time that Amazon is something like this, so Roy Price does not want to risk.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs a guaranteed success, so he keeps a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes a lot of ideas for TV shows and elects eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of this shows and presents them online, where they can watch each free of charge.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon is going out free for free, do you still feel right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers see this episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they don't know that they are watching the shows of this shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are observed by Roy and his team to record all these things.</seg>
<seg id="1066">When you register when the show starts, when you're pausible, what parts you jumps and check again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">You collect millions of data to decide to decide which show you should produce them.</seg>
<seg id="1068">In fact, they collect the data, process these and from it yields the answer, and this is: "Amazon should make a Sitcom over four republican U.S. transitions."</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anyone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"" "Yes," "" "alpha House," "" "but it seems that not many of them can remember the show because it wasn't so good." ""</seg>
<seg id="1072">It's only an average show -- in the truest sense of the Word -- since the average of this curve 7,4 is 7.4 -- and Alpha House arrives at 7.5 -- so slightly above average, but not exactly what else by Roy and his team.</seg>
<seg id="1073">About the same time in another company has another manager creates a top-show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming of Netflix. just like Roy is always searching for this a super show and he uses data for it, but it does something different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of running a competition, he and his team have looked on the existing data about Netflix spectators, thus the reviews that they give the shows, which shows her gigs, etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they utilize these data to find out these little details about the spectators: which shows they like what producers, which actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had together all the parts they went a car, and decided to do not a Sitcom over four transmitters, but a drama series about an Senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards." Netflix has hit one hit, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">House of Cards "gets a 9,1 rating on this curve. so exactly there where they wanted.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course, is the question: what happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">One has two very competent, data experienced firms.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this about?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic was sursomehow that that should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If you collect millions of data, for a decision to meet you, then you should make a good choice.</seg>
<seg id="1086">It has 200 years of statistics as a back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">We are optimized with very powerful computer.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The least what you can expect is good television, or?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis is so wrong, this is quite strange because we live in a time, in which we continue to attack more and more to make serious decisions, far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">Nobody. OK, that's even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that nobody ever comes in contact with this software. come in contact, you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone asks here in the United States and asking for release, it is likely to determine whether the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dismissal is given or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like with Amazon and Netflix. but rather than decide whether a show is good or bad, it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Moderate television, 22 minutes that can be really bad, but more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that these data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results. this is not aware that a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the dates of the most diversified companies are wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google can make mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009, Google announced that it can be caused by data analysis outbreaks of flu, the worst kind of data analysis -- by data analysis of the Google research.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked miraculously and was a great news station. the success was culminated in a publication in the journal Nature "magazine.</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked perfectly, year about year, until it suddenly didn't work anymore,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"" "it just didn't work, this was once again a sensation, including the revocation of the publication" "" "Nature" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the datasterable companies such as Amazon and Google has sometimes misunderstood something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">Despite all these errors, data in the decisions of the life include a -- at the workplace, in which the enforcement is in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So, we should rather make sure that data are helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in the computer-assisted genetics -- a field where some very wise man should use unimaginable many data to make serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years I recognized a few patterns on the difference between successful decisions by using data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be disseminated.</seg>
<seg id="1110">Ever, you have to solve a complex problem, do mainly in two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">As grandest of this problem, you can analyse this problem, so that you can analyse the single parts; as a result of the individual parts you put together to hold a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: apart and set up again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only be able to disassemble a problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to compile the parts again and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool and we all have: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there's something, when the brain is good, it is parts and pieces again put together, even if the information is uncomplete, in order to hold a good conclusion -- especially when the brain is an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Therefore, I believe that Netflix was so successful because they've used data and understanding, where they also belong to the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">You can use the data to understand their audience, for which otherwise it would not have been able to disassemble all these parts, and how to make all these parts, and there is no show such as "House of Cards" which did not stand in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show, which meant that they entered a large personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon, on the other hand, did the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used to control all their decisions, first as they voted by TV ideas as they voted "Alpha House" as show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"" "it was a safe decision because they could always say:" "" "we say the data." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data are helpful for better choices, but I think that things going wrong when data start to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how machting them are, data is only one tool, and in order to forget that this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before it was data, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It is also called "Magic 8 Ball." it's amazing. for decisions by means of a Jaime or no-question you must shake only the ball about. "most likely" -- exactly here in this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I'm going to be later with a technology demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">I have met some decisions in my life, with which I should have listened to the ball.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you can, of course, if you have the data available, you would like to replace them through something much discovering, such as data analysis to make better choices.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the foundations.</seg>
<seg id="1135">For example, the ball will be clashed and clashed. finally, there is no decision to meet decisions if we want to achieve something exceptional at the end of the right curve.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I feel good as very encouraging news that it will always be able to make decisions in spite of the great amount of data, an expert in which you do, and risks to enter risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Because at the end, it is not the data but the risks involved with which you were at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you beautiful.</seg>
