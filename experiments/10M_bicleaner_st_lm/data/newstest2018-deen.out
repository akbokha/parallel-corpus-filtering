Munich 1856 : four cards that change your view onto the city
an Ir@@ ren @-@ An@@ st@@ alt , where young people are to meet today .
a p@@ ft@@ kap@@ elle , where is now under@@ min@@ ed for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
small gar@@ den@@ ers mig@@ rate the lon@@ ely reason of pe@@ as@@ ants .
the oldest official map of Mün@@ ch supports exciting stories about days .
there are nervous when maps are not current .
this knows everyone who had to leave himself because the Auto @-@ Nav@@ i took place a green me@@ adow .
the historic maps of the Digital Bayern @-@ Atl@@ an@@ que , a tender offer by the Ge@@ op@@ ort in Bavaria , are all others as current - but just a very easy @-@ to @-@ circuit .
especially if you compare it with current online @-@ cards .
then , cities and municipalities in the area of Munich Mercury will have changed since the 19th century .
the digital Bayern Atlas is a fli@@ ck@@ du@@ ke that is not equal to such as such .
the large map material were developed to cities and municipalities in more detailed cards , so @-@ called Uran@@ ium , has been incorporated .
these were produced according to the Bavarian Authority of Bavaria between 1810 and 1864 and sk@@ ip the first survey of Bavaria .
your client : Napoleon .
the French army of the army occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
by Napoleon , Napoleon desired an overview of the occupied country and gave a top@@ ographic survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .
even if the French troops were finally pulled down to the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville , Feb@@ . 9 , 1801 , there were today &apos;s neigh@@ bors who created the idea of a country @-@ wide Bavaria @-@ card .
Kur@@ für@@ st Max IV . Joseph drove the project forward , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bay@@ erische Staatsoper Box .
the pri@@ on paper for Munich dates back to 1856 and is like all others can be found on the Bavarian State Library .
the comparison of early / today is the case of the state capital on the most impressive .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
for example , under@@ send@@ ling , which is relatively isolated in the map of 1856 , is still relatively isolated .
the Send@@ ling was born 21 years after the map , in 1877 as a Munich district .
today Unter@@ send@@ ling is in the middle of the city .
in 1856 the houses are concentrated around 1856 along the Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which only was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser , a leader of the Bavarian pe@@ as@@ ants against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where the western park is , you can see nothing as fields - at first sight : in @-@ zo@@ oming , a small @-@ part map with dozens of lines and figures : hand@@ writing marked out of the so @-@ called &quot; Ur@@ ement &quot; from which the basic tax was derived .
there are no farmers there today - but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the plant &quot; Land in Sun . &quot;
the large green area is located north of Unter@@ send@@ ling .
the Theres@@ ien@@ wi@@ ese , founded in the 19th century , was still a me@@ adow and there was no concrete desert in the 19th century .
at the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historic map provides an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the pri@@ on sheet we read in the area of today &apos;s au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen area &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the h@@ ight &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the sk@@ ies &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but also in big letters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ren An@@ st@@ alt &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Yes , here on the outside of the Au@@ er@@ field street , one had once affected people with mad@@ ness .
there was in 1858 / 59 the Munich district of Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; On the Au@@ er Lü@@ ben . &quot;
in 1872 , Dr. Bernhard von G@@ ud@@ den became the establishment of a psychiat@@ rist who is associated with King Ludwig II in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; he was advanced for his time and ended the purchase of the so @-@ called Ir@@ ren . &quot;
in addition , he has under@@ ne@@ ath the staff to apply violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Museum Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who has worked for an exhibition with the Ward .
it was first place for 280 patients and later was extended to 500 seats .
sometimes this capacity was not enough - the reason for construction of the circul@@ ated plant in hair in 1905 .
since 2006 , the Is@@ ar @-@ A@@ MP@@ ER @-@ Klin@@ ikum Munich @-@ Ost is one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ry .
at the site of the former Au@@ er An@@ st@@ alt , young people are in the Munich Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um in Munich .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 , and turned him to a youth center with vocational training .
west is the pitch of the TS@@ V Munich East , east of the 1980s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , the children &apos;s House &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was built in archit@@ ec@@ ologically re@@ jection to the origin of the origin of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by bombing in the Second World War . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Marien@@ platz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Marien@@ platz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was recorded in 1856 as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; head square &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the merchants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; department name &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a decisive change brought the Second World War even in the heart of Mün@@ ch .
the bombs of the Al@@ lies broke out many holes to the downtown in December 1944 .
a big remained until today - at the Marien@@ hof .
the English Institute , small business houses and a greeting from the Middle Ages , once stood on the Marien@@ hof , where these days are scheduled and on 5 April 2017 the ground@@ breaking ceremony will take place for the second S @-@ Bahn line .
with the sli@@ der , the old Munich map can easily compare with the aerial photo of today - and to fill the hole on the Marien@@ hof .
Civil Rights published travel documents for Missouri
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the National Association for Promotion of Far@@ ms has issued a warning for colored people who travel to Missouri . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Guide for the State of Missouri who will come into force by August 28 , 2017 , calls for af@@ ro @-@ American travelers , visitors and mis@@ sour@@ c@@ ans , as a series of frag@@ ment@@ ing , racial inci@@ dents in the last time and here , &quot; says it in the opinion of the Group .
a recent law of Missouri , which makes it difficult to win discrimination against discrimination , as well as the prosecution authorities of the state , imp@@ lic@@ ate the group to release travel documents , the NA@@ AC@@ P said .
&quot; you have injuries of the civil rights to pass through mankind .
they will be put together because of their skin colour , they are defeated or killed , &quot; said the president of the Missouri NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , the Kansas City Star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we listen to complaints in such a frequency we have not heard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the USA .
the group tast@@ ed emer@@ gen@@ cies as rac@@ ist verses against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee .
S@@ anders died under un@@ question@@ able circumstances in the beginning of the year , after he had no petrol more than the journey by the state of Missouri , and was accused of accused of crimes in custody .
the Council also has a recent report by the Office of the At@@ tor@@ ney General of Missouri , in which it is shown that black drivers are more common than white people in the state 75 per cent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that humans are aware and their families , friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; people must be ready to bring whether the deposits should bring , or the relatives have to know that they go through the state . &quot;
Missouri was in the year 2015 100 Hass@@ elt , after the latest numbers from the Hass@@ ver@@ break @-@ report program of the FBI , which enables the state in relation to the number of injuries to the 16th place of the country .
travel is also a reply to a new Missouri law that it would be more difficult to acc@@ use a company for residential or employment discrimination .
previously published the American Civil Liber@@ ian Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) travel agent in Texas and Arizona , following the immigration authorities to commit for@@ wards , people due to immigration fraud , which will contribute to the extension of the AC@@ L@@ U for further breeding .
travel documents are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but in recent days , stakeholders have put the measure as response to certain laws and trends within the United States .
electric fence project is Elem@@ ental
the Li@@ erb@@ ach electric fence project is a success project and will be continued next year .
the CD@@ U Bundest@@ ag@@ s@@ men Peter White and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac have abolished a picture on the spot .
representatives of the family @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ mann family met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two M@@ EP@@ s at the For@@ mer@@ ging Court of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family .
Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann also granted insights into its operation in which he cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and as many young people and houses in five apartments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black Forest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is for him the alternative way for the milk of his cows , so Schwen@@ n@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a regional office is located on the table of the holidays .
since he is also the S HV @-@ Chairman of Fisch@@ erb@@ ach , he called the Wei@@ ght@@ ful Project as &quot; Elem@@ ental Import@@ ant . &quot;
I can do not profit on der@@ art steep surfaces .
the green area is sufficient for much work , much shots with the brush@@ cutter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have shown here with the terms and the top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schwen@@ n@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 he took over the el@@ ial operation and management of these without chemical plant protection and fertilizer , even if it lead no bio @-@ operation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commun@@ e has recognized the importance of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wei@@ dec@@ aun@@ ts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and is delighted about leader promotion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the cost of 3000 to 4000 Euros per hectare the farmers would have to be supported .
one hope that the stress of the land could still be gone out for a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest treasure that we have , are the people who work in agriculture , and imagine thoughts , as they continue their operation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the farmers are often in criticism
in 2013 , there were a total of 25 plots of eleven participants fenced in 2013 .
the dis@@ closure area is thus 40 hectares , which may not be for@@ ged until at least 20@@ 23 .
the half of leader was funded by the total cost of 71 500 Euros , a quarter contributed by the municipality of Fisch@@ erb@@ ach .
thus the farmers stayed 12 610 euros , they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometers of wheat fence .
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; explained Schwen@@ n@@ mann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you do not make a really good job without farmers and farmers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also for Peter White stood there : &quot; here are the best food produced here . &quot;
the Regional Court ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Wur@@ tt@@ emberg enables the state support of fran@@ c@@ ality .
the aim is to maintain the Black Forest .
prer@@ equ@@ is@@ ite is the presence of a donation written by L@@ PR .
in addition , the enclosed area should not be bad @-@ per@@ v@@ able ( hang@@ ar over 35 per cent ) and must therefore be threatened with the loss of power .
for the Fish @-@ Fo@@ aun@@ ting project 2018 , the application is currently running from eight participants with 24 pitches , which would like to build almost 16 kilometers of fence .
the dis@@ closure area corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated cost is more than 112 000 Euro .
is nothing more sacred ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump takes up the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is to attack the statues .
the Americans estimate the same as any other - therefore the carefully produced Saddam Hussein &apos;s place on the Fir@@ dos place in Bagh@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of Tr@@ ump @-@ regime , knew what he did when he did an em@@ bo@@ lic battle with Jim A@@ co@@ sta from CNN about the suggestions for dra@@ stic limitation of legitim@@ ate immigration to the Statue of Liberty .
in order to stay fair , Miller did not handle the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of bo@@ aters and Liberty I@@ mit@@ ators would have been gel@@ yn@@ g@@ ish when he had done it .
but it took their significance , and in particular the meaning that it was attributed to her when the famous po@@ em of Emma found Lazarus , 17 years after the completion of the memorial , its base was added .
when Miller A@@ co@@ sta compl@@ ained : &quot; I don &apos;t want to enter a full thing about history but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom , which enligh@@ tens the world .
the po@@ em , which you refer to that later was added later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
Miller is objec@@ tively true , but how he formulated it itself , is not really a story .
it &apos;s about the contemporary reson@@ ance of Lazarus , the only one , in which a state does not only invites to an old immigrants , but the poor of the poor : &quot; your poor , your poor , and your poor masses , who seek to bre@@ athe free , / the afflicted waste of your rich coasts . &quot;
there never had a time in which the &quot; el@@ ating refuse &quot; was better to see on our screens .
Miller committed himself in literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Tr@@ umps in USA .
this conflict due to its importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural debate : it is in fact a conflict around the importance of America .
Lazarus - and her friends who deplo@@ y their words after her death on the basis - knew very good that they complete a highly political action .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American Repub@@ lic@@ ism , in an un@@ used classical image depic@@ ting the femin@@ ism of freedom .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in its po@@ em is the female figure no more abstract - she has received a voice .
and there is another name : mother of the ex@@ il@@ ant .
the combination of the Ge@@ di@@ ver &apos;s combination with the painting is a brilliant femin@@ ist Cou@@ p and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and exactly like Lazarus the significance of the statue , the people wanted to change the people from the right wing as long as long .
the big Schrei@@ er Rush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argu@@ ed in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty was con@@ serv@@ iced , but rather an early neo @-@ con@@ doms , that put the American flame into the converted world : &quot; Lady Liberty continues .
she is supposed to bear the tor@@ ch of freedom of the United States in the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch should not shine in the United States . &quot;
quite unusual is Lim@@ bau@@ gh click here to something .
the meaning of the statue is quite a matter of perception of perception .
the great imag@@ in@@ ative in@@ ative of Lazarus was built in them to see how they saw from the exhau@@ sted , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible trips on the ships of ships .
it is in the tru@@ est sense to see the world from perspective of people who seek refuge and have a chance to improve their lives .
their statue says to them the words of hope and of the will , which they must hear .
and that &apos;s not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump ever want to know .
their tor@@ ch shall not shine the way , but the hat@@ red that is the only source of power to ign@@ ite .
world Championship 2017 : Neil Black lo@@ ys Scottish Members of the Great Britain
Eil@@ id@@ h Do@@ yle reminds on a time when only two Sc@@ ots belonged to the UK team
the general director of the athlet@@ ics of the United Kingdom , Neil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member of Scottish consul@@ ter in the world championship &quot; has a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes won in London for 2017 , which will start on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; black has believed that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Scotland , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the athlet@@ ics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it , and we try to understand it , and we will continue until we &apos;ll find out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I speak with people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they did . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they did .
British Athletics : it &apos;s something to do with what they did .
and also with the type on the street corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are medals of medals , among them Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ cher , who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m track while Eil@@ id@@ h Do@@ yle was elected to the team of Captain .
&quot; Eil@@ id@@ h is quite modest .
her capit@@ als was incredible , &quot; says Black .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a number of athletes , regardless of whether they were Scottish or exercise , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motiv@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the passion and the real feeling that Eil@@ id@@ h all of course was great . &quot;
the Commonwealth @-@ Silver medal winner , who will compete with its fifth world championships in the 400 @-@ m hur@@ dles , says that it is &quot; incredible &quot; that 16 vill@@ i are in the British team .
Scotland has previously been the best total number of athletes at the World Championship in 1983 and 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ ir &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; centre leads to this path and has positioned five UK and two European records last year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will be able to participate in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m of rounds .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another mo@@ ck which is considered to be a great season , which included the victory of the British team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games .
Do@@ yle is remin@@ is@@ cent of her first world championships as the only other Sch@@ otte in the team Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the capit@@ als says that they are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very proud of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that many of their farmers will not only belong to the team , but in some cases also will be with medals and among the fin@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; to be so special about our team capit@@ als , it is that it was voted by the other members of the team , so that my team mates have voted for me and voted me to something very special for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; obviously , I am very proud of all the vill@@ i who belong to the team .
it shows just how far we arrived .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they are here as well @-@ established athletes , athletes who want to rise to podium . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what my speech about cap@@ turing ?
Yes , I think it went well .
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation , since we have a home world championship .
so it is really important to put on this hom@@ est@@ assi@@ um and to benefit from it , we are back in the Olympiastadion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I get a second chance to go out there and will be just like a great atmosphere because there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
block Kr@@ iti@@ que on Facebook : don &apos;t worry about a public office if you don &apos;t reduce the impact of voters .
the father of our country knew something from bad press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long until the newspapers struck him because of all , from the interior policy up to his political principles .
he imp@@ lied with criticism , safe .
but he did not bring his critics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the year 1783 Washington said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom of speech may be taken away - and , and m@@ ute , we will lead to the sheep . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry H@@ og@@ an who must work to be more like Washington .
H@@ og@@ ans employees have blo@@ cked the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted their opinion on its official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ian Union claimed him this week .
the Staff of the governor left the law@@ suit as the fri@@ ar , and the online @-@ commentary was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; Na , and ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s just Facebook &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; many people said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important if it is a guy like H@@ og@@ an .
this is a republi@@ can Governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is aston@@ ish@@ ingly popular .
he has the second highest consent of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
H@@ og@@ an is no re@@ ac@@ tionary h@@ ill@@ head .
he has shown a fixed hand on the guidance of his state and strict observ@@ ance of the principles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he was also very sent to use Facebook as a primary energy to de@@ activate himself with its voters and playing his hair@@ less head towards chemotherapy on his side . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , the block@@ age of persons coming on the side of the governor - which is a public forum , which will be officially designated as officially and of employees who are paid with public tax dollar - un@@ necessarily and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post def@@ ended H@@ og@@ an spokesperson Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse the acts of the govern@@ ors and argu@@ ed that the block@@ age of the comments was nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it is too easy to use the image of trol@@ ls or chambers or water @-@ filled people which force the wh@@ ip online .
the post spoke with some of the real people who were blo@@ cked by H@@ og@@ an .
and these are just real people who speak with their chosen leaders , a teacher , a business@@ man and a priest , no Tro@@ l@@ le .
they all said that their comments are respec@@ t@@ ful , think and not prof@@ ane .
the priest said the Bible in his post office , and called his name to H@@ og@@ ans &apos;s Catholic faith .
lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , m@@ d . , was not h@@ asser@@ ed but she asked to hate crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote in the commentary sector of the news &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not think that idea , if a number of people will take place at the same subject , in some more than a so @-@ called collective , and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what the members of the governor as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated spam attack &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would call other likely &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inter@@ c@@ ession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to convert a message by simply blo@@ cked a critic or deleted a negative comment .
it is much more clean@@ ers than in history if one had done the same , that employees were sent to collect newspapers with critical conductivity and be burned to silence and to silence .
but exactly that happens now .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public officials , who critic@@ ises Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is compl@@ ained by Twitter users who have been blo@@ cked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question was last week in Virginia .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of Lou@@ dou@@ n County ver@@ ted the First Am@@ end@@ ment , according to the US District Judge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when she committed a voters from their Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Governor Matt Before ( R ) received a visit to AC@@ L@@ U for using Facebook and Twitter .
that should not be so difficult .
at the moment Wash@@ ing@@ tons had a similar effect like the Internet .
the number of newspapers multiply between 1776 and 1800 , and anonymous post@@ p@@ ens on his lead .
and then , Washington had anonymous Tro@@ l@@ le .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people , pseud@@ ony@@ ms , such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Por@@ ti@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington decisions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pet@@ itions , which critic@@ ised its position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , trade and shipping with the United Kingdom , his ministry , according to the historical documents , collected by the Online Papers of George Washington Project .
but he did not get silence .
freedom of speech , freedom of opinion and dis@@ courses belong to our nation .
and true leadership means to accept that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort at Renaissance Club
the former Europeans n ° 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope in the next three days at home entertainment since the Renaissance Club in East Loth@@ ian staged the 25th issue of the Scottish Senior Open .

&quot; the players will see this course from his best side , it &apos;s in a great condition .
Jerry has made a great job when he fixed this place .
he is a jeal@@ ous disc@@ ol@@ y of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great show@@ case for this course . &quot;
Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defend a championship for the first time , although in his 32 @-@ year career , he has won both in the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour .
&quot; this really feels particularly to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the player located in South@@ port . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I haven &apos;t defend the Extre@@ mad@@ ura Open , as it was in the year after I won it out of the program .
back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
the rec@@ olle@@ ctions come back from last year , and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon , last year here .
it was a really special time and one that we always estimate . &quot;
Gary OR@@ R who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50th birthday in this year , returns to the ground floor .
this event will be the first Scottish gig since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it always means a little more if you play at home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OR@@ R , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you want to do it well , but you felt this additional pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again , and I played a solid Golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad , as it is gone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

less lung cancer through passive smoking
in the past two decades , less people are dead because of passive smoking and lung cancer .
scientists from the University Clinic of Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) in one study will come to this result .
&quot; according to our estimates , 167 lung cancer cases came back on passive smoking , &quot; said study director Hei@@ ko Becher .
as a comparison , he moved his own study on this topic in 1994 .
at that time , there were still 400 lung cancer cases due to passive smoking a year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new study is published in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; International Journal of Public Health &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
house connections are subject to a very complex
the construction work in the Vill@@ inger Straße is in full swing and &quot; are acceptable in the period , &quot; says the Head of the Center Fred Hein@@ ze .
in the area of the house connections , the situation is more complex than suspected , as much hidden in the ground that is not listed in the plans .
the traffic , which holds the construction works again , represents a large problem for the construction group of the St@@ ump@@ p company .
&quot; the Ig@@ nor@@ k@@ ance of motor@@ ists in front of red lights and un@@ lock is already huge , &quot; says Hein@@ ze .
the road is closed and only the bus buses be eligible for passage .
Angelo Car@@ uso , Marvin Kost@@ or@@ z and Tim Kost@@ ro@@ z from the St@@ ump@@ p company has been working with works on the bridge since weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days were very beautiful . &quot; &quot; &quot;

poverty and death in the Indonesian Gold@@ land
if Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i cooked dinner , uses no cooker .
they use only rarely a pot .
in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of Pan@@ i@@ ai Reg@@ ent@@ aries in the in@@ und@@ in@@ dones@@ ian province of Papua , lays the house@@ wife normally a sweet potato , locally as &quot; Not@@ a &quot; - directly into the chim@@ ney .
after half an hour , the char@@ gers will be taken with eggs , un@@ washed hands and swal@@ lowed up .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay ground - it has no furniture - where they also perform their daily work , such as garments with cloudy water from the nearby s@@ ump .
a bucket in a hom@@ eless room serves as a lan@@ tern .
as the youngest of four wives of her husband , their fields were assigned .
poly@@ gam@@ ie is common here .
of course you can work too late : most vill@@ agers are unemployed , and many are heavy , and there &apos;s the soldiers here .
&quot; nobody turns out after 17 o &apos;clock in the village , &quot; she says .
it is a rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ lands of Papua , a former Dutch colony , which was taken in 1969 after a controversi@@ al referendum in Indonesia , when only 1.0@@ 26 were supposed to vote against the occupying troops .
an existing movement , which touched the independence against the Dutch rule , turned to the government of Jakarta who maintains control of the region and exclu@@ de foreign journalists or legal status of them .
in 2003 , the province was officially split in Papua New Guinea , whereby the independent part of Papua New Guinea was covered by the eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is so steep like it is br@@ ittle . the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the province of Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a early 5 @-@ hour drive with the car rental .
there are no public transport .
the town of approximately 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses , surrounded by b@@ am@@ bo@@ ot@@ ers , and made of corrugated ro@@ ofs , which were converted by rust in different yellow tones .
only very few Indonesia have done their journey here , because journalists and practically no foreig@@ ner did not depart .
before Christian mission@@ aries came , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans came to a god called U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were also other changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were not acc@@ ust@@ omed to bear these clothing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and indicates its vi@@ bran@@ t , hand@@ woven tur@@ ban , its dar@@ ker shirt and their bright rock . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we just had leaves to our body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Papua is Indonesia &apos;s largest province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and some of the worst children &apos;s worst and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s Gold@@ land .
the biggest and most profitable gol@@ mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort brought gold and copper worth 3.1 billion US dollars .
in addition , Papua resources has a value of estimated 78 billion US dollars .
however , these riches are a source of El@@ mer for the Papua , who ensure that Indonesia has preserved a first military presence .
an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort Local Mil@@ itä@@ ran@@ ge@@ ons and units paid almost 20 million US dollars , including up to 150.000 US dollars to a single officer .
Pap@@ u@@ anian claims after larger autonomy thre@@ aten the golden g@@ ans and they are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly .
according to data from milit@@ ants , more than 500,000 nations have been killed and thousands of thousands have been rap@@ ed by the Indonesian military since 1969 , tor@@ tured and imprisoned since 1969 .
massacre in Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s tri@@ es@@ hi@@ ps in the 1970 @-@ 1990s were executed in accordance with the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission for genocide .
in the region alone , the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we lose all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the year 2016 in a report on atro@@ cities in the year 2016 , including illegal exec@@ utions and torture - rape and tri@@ cr@@ ises are particularly popular according to another report - and the brutal defeat of peaceful demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims due to each week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bolts have reinforced , since Pap@@ u@@ as resources have an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but the demo@@ graphic development changes to become Muslim economic immigrants from the popul@@ ated islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra , and Sul@@ awes@@ i .

the Indonesian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , known in the crow@@ ds and as a Jok@@ ow@@ i , said during his election campaign in 2014 , the in@@ equ@@ alities and the legal injuries in Papua
the former Zimmermann secured 27 of the 29 districts in Papua ( including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jakarta .
but in Papua has changed little , and today the loc@@ als will feel betrayed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our hearts have broken , because we have agreed in 2014 for Jok@@ ow@@ i , with anticip@@ ation that he will fulfill our hopes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says You . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered a deep point for two months after the Jok@@ ow@@ is inauguration in October .
on December 7 , 2014 there was a group of 11 children without and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a camp fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indonesian soldiers broke out in a motorbike through the darkness .
they told them that they should embar@@ k on their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers participated in their sound and later returned with four soldiers , the local Pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had drunk , pursued and struck the group with their ri@@ fl@@ es , they were victims and witnesses .
then fired one of the soldiers into the group of children .
one child , 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so bad@@ ly struck that he fell into the Com@@ a .
a few hours later the building of the nearby government commission was set fire on fire and the things fin@@ ed on the next day .
about 1,000 young people , women and children gathered themselves together at a soccer field before the local police station and the military commander to demand justice .
they carried the colonial hunting ri@@ fug@@ es and led the Wa@@ ita dance - in the circle continuously and a bird @-@ singing im@@ itation - by Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ tribe .
demonstr@@ ators began to overcome a couple of demonstr@@ ators on police and military po@@ res .
when the atmosphere was heated , a command was sent to a command of an internal radio : &quot; if the masses have more than three times , they shoot them , &quot; says it was not released in an official document by TI@@ ME , which was not released in the local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias k@@ ay@@ er , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ quarter of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threat@@ ening danger and called to calm and ur@@ ged the amount to return home .
nobody was listening in the mood .
&quot; when I turned back , I was shot in my left hand in my left hand , &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the veranda of his colorful wooden house .
Kay@@ t@@ ame knows not yet , who swe@@ pt away , but says that the ball came together out of the two rows of the soldiers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was crow@@ ded , many shots were fired , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he adds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was taken three times , his c@@ ousin , the witness of the shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I went to him and under@@ took his body to make sure that he was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , which bears only one name , the TI@@ ME in a dark mood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw that he was dead ... I have kissed him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the che@@ er spec@@ tor of the Papua Police , Y@@ ot@@ je M@@ end , said Rep@@ orters , that his officers only wanted to secure their station only &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because they are attacked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves if people are threat@@ ening to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Papua Police , Commissioner Pud@@ ong Su@@ ff@@ i@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many more viol@@ ated .
the messages about the k@@ illings came first on the following day &apos; to Jakarta .
three weeks in Jay@@ ap@@ ura in Jay@@ ap@@ ura an passionate talk given in the sympath@@ ies for the families of the victims , Sw@@ ab@@ or , the historical mis@@ circumstances in Papua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to be solved by this case , so it will not happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2016 , the Wir@@ anto Minister of Security said that he may establish an extra@@ judicial mechanism for settlement of historic human rights violations .
but the expres@@ sions began almost immediately .
&quot; most injuries are occurred before long time .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we have committed to face these violations , but there are processes that must prevail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then , Wir@@ anto made a re@@ treat , as he said on June 5 in Jakarta with TI@@ ME and said that he had no plans in order to create a complaint mechanism .
instead , &quot; everything is regulated by law , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Wir@@ anto , accused of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which resulted in more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or &apos;s independence of independence from 1999 said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua were already buried , including Pan@@ i@@ ai subur@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
families of Pan@@ i@@ ai victims met these alleg@@ ations with fierce dis@@ believers .
&quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times in the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes .
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says that he still lives in fear for years .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was afraid to be arrested by the military , but I &apos;m afraid to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai was afraid to discuss the incident .
he says that he was defeated by the army after he helped save four of the victims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after I was buried the bodies , the military , after me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says he . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the shooting was not stopped .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police captured local vill@@ agers in the neighborhood of D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai .
during a con@@ front@@ ation between village residents and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma , refused to bring a consciousness to the hospital , a person and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , the 24 year old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was drunk , when he was caught in a nearby river , died on the way to hospital .
reserved village residents protest@@ ed in front of the company &apos;s location .
the police said that the vill@@ agers threw stones into officers , who re@@ acted on it by pressing the warning shots .
but loc@@ als say that the mobile Brigade ( Indonesian par@@ amil@@ itary police ) began to shoot and killed one killing .
&quot; we were so in pan@@ ic , we have fear that there is reven@@ ge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u B@@ adi@@ i who lives and witness close to the hospital , and the TI@@ ME is as fast as the last here .
&quot; I hid myself two days in my house . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai Parliament called to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai parliament to draw officers to draw and draw the mobile Brigade of the Police from the territory . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a bul@@ ky for the Indonesian government .
the lack of sen@@ su@@ al development strengthens the satisfaction of the family @-@ affiliated to Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and Dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Papua .
many joined the &quot; Free State Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the Reb@@ ellen@@ ic Army , who claims to defend the rights of Papua New Guinea , rising by Indonesian troops and demonstrations by Indonesian soldiers .
some of the top @-@ O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , among them T@@ adi@@ us Y@@ og@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das Kog@@ oya .
in response to the recent decades of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai , thousands of people were arrested and arbitr@@ ary in custody , under the pre@@ text of the &quot; securing of national so@@ vereig@@ n@@ ty . &quot;
some never go back again .
among the people in Papua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tra@@ gic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction .
the little rice , which is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is for loc@@ als too expensive .
bread is just beyond the range .
the people here build everything they eat : especially emergency and fruits and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can process four or five fields of sweet potatoes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they retain the majority of the harvest for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ten pieces Not@@ a tast@@ ed only 10,000 Indonesian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 cents ) .
in the course of time , economic im@@ in@@ ctions had grown between the native Papua and the new migrants , which has arrived in bigger number since the opening of new flights to Nab@@ ire &apos;s airport .
the few jobs , which are in the region , go to the better trained and we@@ al@@ thy migrants .
in Papua , the capital or the necessary skills to lead their own company competitive .
&quot; young people are not interested in to stay in the village ... for there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the Council of Pan@@ i@@ ai .
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Papua
Moreover , restrictions on the coverage of international media are sc@@ anned .
at the beginning of the year the French journalist Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ das and Bas@@ ille Long@@ ch@@ amp were deported by lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua ( though they were given rare permission to films ) .
according to Ph@@ el@@ im K@@ ine , the Pre@@ sidents of Asia @-@ Director of Human Rights Watch , the refer@@ endu@@ ms of Jok@@ ow@@ is , were to raise restrictions of reporting to promote transparency and development , not realized .
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists , trying to report from Indonesia &apos;s un@@ quiet eastern provinces of Papua and West@@ pap@@ ua , said : visa @-@ ref@@ usal and a black list , &quot; he said in a statement .
lack of press control means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government remains limited to the immediate neighbours Pap@@ u@@ as .
in March , six Pacific states - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the mar@@ sh@@ al islands and the Salom@@ ons Islands - the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widely used injuries &quot; in Papua
those countries have histor@@ ically seen the O@@ PM .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the spokes@@ man for the Indonesian Ministry of Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha Nas@@ ir pointed out the Group in Jakarta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Indonesia still has a democratic system , and there are free media , so it is difficult to prevent the evidence of human rights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
people want to know that more foreign governments should take this .
when an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the leadership of the human right of ambassador , Ke@@ es Van Ba@@ ar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura visited him . &quot; we want freedom , &quot; according to a source that took part in the session but want to remain anonymous .
in 2019 , Indonesia left one more presidential election , but the Papua say that they probably will not agree on Jok@@ ow@@ i .
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good inten@@ tions , but he is surrounded by people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai Sch@@ wal@@ kers , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the Council .
he wants to know that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai Nation said that it is among the constant threat of a rob@@ ber@@ ian military , in poverty , healthcare and health services .
Gob@@ ai said that the Pan@@ i@@ ai men , like other Papua New Guinea , consider their voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; debt &quot; that he must pay back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t need money , they want only righteousness , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite the thre@@ ats and in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation , families of Pan@@ i@@ ai Sch@@ uss@@ ani led to the last symbolic act of appearance : the dead body of a victim was buried on a site exactly compared to the police and military station .
they perhaps know that they might never forget justice , but at least they will not forget the responsible persons responsible for their crimes .
&quot; a member of our family has been killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us , with a direct head .
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; Wol@@ k@@ enk@@ r@@ atz@@ er from Dubai for the second time
a fire was found on Friday in one of the highest residential doors of the world in Dubai , hundreds of inhabitants , from 337 meters high , 79 @-@ story building to flee .
it is the second brand , which is located in just two years by the high building , which is called by the Tor@@ ch @-@ Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) .
the building was evacu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word on the cause of flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we have stood up with fire alarm and scre@@ ams of people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we burnt down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50th floor to the bottom , &quot; told , a residents named as George attacks , Reuters .
Dub@@ ais civil protection agencies said that the units of fire fighting at 4.00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .00 GMT ) the fire extingu@@ ished and the building det@@ ects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they work on the provision of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Aff@@ ected &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident may have questions regarding safety of materials that are used in external areas of high buildings around the world , revi@@ ved .
a study carried out by the management of the Tor@@ ch @-@ building after its fire in 2015 , that the largest part of the damage caused by the fair@@ ing , the outer covering for decoration or insulation .

no Davis Cup reform : on Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International tennis courts ( IT@@ F ) is marked with his great Davis Cup Cou@@ p at the Annual General Meeting .
in the Ho Chi Minh City meeting , which was only supported for this sport revolutionary proposal , Davis Cup @-@ Individual is only supported on two winners , hood and not supported by the required two @-@ third majority .
although often very long , but therefore also very estimated five @-@ sentence classic remain the same .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 percent of the Member States voted for reform , the goal of the IT@@ F president David Hag@@ ger@@ ty , therefore , was missing just short .
&quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members have not received the complete reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change in order to secure the long @-@ term future of this iconic and historical con@@ tests , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you will continue to work , improve the application .
even at all , the proposal before the vote was already before , the finals has come into a neutral place .
new ones in 2018 are only compar@@ atively smaller details : the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will be announced in the following round in the following round .
to decrease the costs for the organis@@ er , the requirements contained in training places etc . facilitates and players will need to complete the official media event before the Davis Cup .
more than 1 out of 5 US travelers put banned items into the plane , finds a survey
a survey conducted among passengers that revealed more than 20 percent of deliber@@ ately un@@ aware of non @-@ conscious items to the control points of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 per cent , which carried out the plane while they had forbidden knives or other items with blades .
less than 1 percent claimed , they had discovered that they were ir@@ resi@@ ding with fire@@ arms , amm@@ un@@ ition , or explo@@ sives .
the survey conducted at more than 1.000 people - who was conducted by a jet char@@ tered service , the Strat@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , was also determined that younger trav@@ ellers have rather dis@@ regard the rules .
of the respon@@ dents , ass@@ uming that they have been trying to fly with something that was banned by T@@ SA , 19,@@ 7 percent mill@@ enni@@ als , compared to less than 15 percent , members of the generation X were .
the most common objects that were inten@@ tionally related to T@@ SA agents were foods and fluids .
more than 3 percent experienced similar items with clin@@ ches caused by security check , while 2.2 percent of female respon@@ dents and 3.7 percent of the male respon@@ dents have confirmed that they had expressed inten@@ tionally related drugs to the aircraft .
the company said it is inter@@ viewed by travelers in the whole country to find out how many acci@@ dentally had brought low @-@ related products through the airport , and how many might have done it .
no surprise , it is no surprise that people who are in most frag@@ ile and un@@ wis@@ ely - through the security , those were the most common .
the company however , points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are stra@@ ight@@ forward and conf@@ using .
people are often un@@ certain which can take up liquids or how much of them .
so it &apos;s no surprise that the greatest amount of objects of the T@@ SA conf@@ is@@ cated liquids are prohibited .
one time , the people , the T@@ SA could watch books as a der@@ og@@ ative product .
liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k is no matter : tens of thousands of Tesla customers Cancel an order
electric @-@ thous@@ and@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k with the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tesla &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
so far , he has under@@ estimated that a part of the customer has withdrawn its obligation of engagement .
in addition to its triumph@@ ant numbers at sales growth and more gig@@ antic sales targets , Tesla CEO El@@ on Mus@@ k has received another , less gl@@ a@@ ful number : the cancellations made at the new mass market model 3 .
Mus@@ k frequently had more than 500,000 orders for the new car in the past months , whose delivery is just starting .
now Mus@@ k is a : of the total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 orders , 63@@ .000 have been withdrawn .
critics have always noted that it is just for reservations and reservations .
at a cancellation fee , the 1000 Euros ( US $ 1,000 in US dollars ) is paid wholly in the US $ 1000 pounds ) .
currently 45@@ 5.000 of these suggested reservations , nut@@ k in a telephone conference with anal@@ ysts .
that the cancellation of so far approximately twelve percent of all orders could be solved , however , the Tesla CEO does not believe .
his argument : the challenge at the ambitious growth target is not in demand , but on the production site .
last year Tesla 84@@ ,000 cars delivered .
2018 - all models assembled - 500,000 will be one million by 2020 .
the demand is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k , 1800 reservations are currently accepted for reservations .
those who today receive a &quot; Model 3 &quot; may be ordered in the second half of 2018 , if Tesla it creates to drive its n@@ ag@@ el@@ new , never in practice tested high@@ ways without greater interrup@@ tions with maximum capacity utilization .
many experts doub@@ ts that this is possible .
but if the del@@ ays could be del@@ ays , then the in@@ binding of reservations may be made for Tesla .
for then , the company can &apos;t collect un@@ satisfied customers to run in pairs .
EPA CEO P@@ ru@@ itt goes back on to reduce emissions of the Obama @-@ Er@@ a rules to reduce emissions
one day after having been accused of 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the chief of the environmental protection authority , rejected his previous decision to reduce the implementation of the Obama era , to reduce emissions caused by smo@@ g pollution .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change , as his agency proved to meet the needs of the state environmental protection against re@@ ac@@ tionary than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the law@@ suit against his prior job in the Federal Employment Tribunal .
it comes to a deadline that ran on October 1 for States to comply with the standards of level o@@ zone by 2015 .
P@@ ru@@ itt declared in June that he would not hesitate to hesitate any year to study the plan for more time to study the plan and avoid frequent economic decisions in local decisions . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was before his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump State Prosecutor of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , was a long time a reliable opponent on environmental protection regulations .
since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly been repeatedly floo@@ ded or delayed , to retain the chemical industry and industry of fossil fuels .
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the most recent legal redemption for the P@@ ru@@ itts regulatory roll@@ back agenda .
last month , a Federal Constitutional Court decided that the EPA administrator passed its authority as he tried to eradi@@ c@@ ate the implementation of a rule of Obama administration , oil and gas businesses to monitoring and reduce methane emissions .
in a position published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ ined testified that his swe@@ eping force in o@@ zone is simply simply the read@@ iness of EPA for collaboration with the States to intensi@@ fy the new standards of re@@ proof of the new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under previous administr@@ ations , the EPA often has often observed the dead@@ lines and then was waiting to set out of activists and others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who accused the EPA more than a dozen times in its previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in a regulation by court procedure , and we accept dead@@ lines . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also take the law and authority , which gives us serious &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nonetheless , the position of EPA reported that P@@ ru@@ ined sometime his &quot; powers to delay and all others are legally available . &quot; to ensure that the rules &quot; on a solid policy and the best available information are based . &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in the Congress falls on a more comprehensive version of the o@@ zone rules .
a bill in the last month of permission is to be delayed by at least eight years for 2015 .
the measure was not added to the vote in the Senate .
the New York general prosecutor &apos;s At@@ tor@@ ney Eric Ex@@ der@@ man , who led the Coalition led by EPA in this week , said the group int@@ end to just@@ ify the statutory pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the return of the EPA - after our complaints - is an important profit for health and security of these 6.7 million Americans that are directly affected by Smo@@ oth , who flows directly from smo@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said cutting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new York is in this case California , Connecticut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minnesota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ sy@@ l@@ van@@ ien , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
soil @-@ Oz@@ on@@ on , if pollutants from cars , power stations , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere are react to sunlight .
the smo@@ ked smo@@ g can cause serious bre@@ aths to serious problems , and contribute to thousands of premature death cases each year .
representatives of public health and environmental protection attracted more than P@@ itts surprising course .
&quot; it &apos;s qui@@ escent , how much pressure it needs to get this reasonable step by the responsible for the protection of the air which we bre@@ athe , &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d from Center for Bi@@ ological Diversity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must continue fighting the ide@@ ological cross of the Tr@@ ump government to join environmental remedi@@ ation and other interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Society wants to check permission of wind turbines
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sees no legal requirements for the construction and has therefore turned on to the land@@ rat . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has sum@@ mon@@ ed Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) , its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is illegal .
the association argu@@ ed that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 , no wind turbines could not have been approved , as at the time in four verses only at the border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal exists a wind force concentration zone .
within this concentration Zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are possible in principle , at the same time the concentration Zone however delivers an exclusion of wind turbines for the rest of the town .
&quot; &quot; &quot; such zones should prevent a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saving &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the landscape . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the city of Vier@@ sen had a few days earlier through a change of land protection plan for a second wind power zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette - but the Düsseldorf District Government was not approved because of a form of formation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the missing plan of legal conditions , the authorized approval of per@@ taining to such un@@ lawful and therefore also rep@@ aid , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ kens , Chairman of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
state of the things : in front of the summer break , the city council has decided once again the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette . a approval of the district government is still standing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ kens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is excluded at this position as a permit for the construction of wind turbines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the collection .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding writing has been received since the last week during the circle &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said one speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the event , it takes the reason to test the matter again .
however , they do not expect that the procedure is stopped .
with a view of the ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle was unable to express with regards to the arg@@ um@@ entation of the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; .
NEW Re , a subsidiary of NEW , plans on a surface at the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette to build four metres high wind turbines .
last year , the company had already involved in which the city of Vier@@ sen was moderate , p@@ addle contracts with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares are closed .
with the erection of the four wind turbines , the power requirement of around 11 400 households can be covered - that corresponds to roughly one fifth of the current daily requirement of all four households .
the NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
in the past summer , there was a green light for buying three wind turbines at the wind farm Lin@@ ni@@ ch at Aachen and a shar@@ ehol@@ ding in a wind turbines in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district of Hein@@ sberg .

according to Police Regulations , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman left Bor@@ ni@@ ch with their passenger car as part of the accompanying driving with their 53 year old mother as accompanying person the L 333 in the direction of Bo@@ gel .
city and dealer plan &quot; homeland sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; weekend
Bad Lan@@ gen@@ i@@ a@@ er and people from the region are to re@@ discover the shops in the city centre in September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trade association and the city authorities will take advantage of the weekend on September 8th and 9th to at@@ tract the inhabitants to the shopping centre . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the chairman of the commercial partner , Christian König , announced , the &quot; homeland sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; will conduct the customers that offers their own city away from the usual supermarket @-@ product .
planned is therefore a market with regional providers , similar to the weekly market .
in addition , loc@@ als are to present themselves with their apprentices@@ hi@@ ps .
in addition , the shops of the city centre can be stopped at night @-@ shop shopping .
this is not only the inhabitants of the city and the near@@ er region .
in preparation , advertising spots on the radio , a Internet video , and printed bag that refer to the promotional weekend , Christian König .
municipal management and commercial enterprises co @-@ operate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus the commercial society and the town go to a further stage of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; attraction city &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; project . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with these include new offers like the first &quot; acti@@ v Day &quot; for Brun@@ nen@@ fest , with selling Sunday , convers@@ ations with all entrepren@@ eurs and operations to move them to active participation .
also attractive offers to Saturday and the aband@@ oning on parking fees on that day are part of the concept .
customers will also be newly developed or re @-@ opened .
these include spa guests and tourists .
but also many loc@@ als would have lost the centre of shopping at a glance .
by the end , everyone would have to help to revi@@ ve the city centre - to rent the accommodation of all the city and clubs .
it was speaking to overcome the Le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy network that did part spread themselves in the spring of spring .
Birgit Stre@@ ich , head of the Chamber of Commerce in Müh@@ l@@ hausen in Müh@@ l@@ hausen , to participate in the nationwide &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; day , first five Thuring@@ ian cities .
in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ sa this Weimar are Weimar , s@@ so@@ da , Heilig@@ en@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ er@@ ode .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the day should advertise for the appreci@@ ation of local trade and its importance for the simil@@ ar@@ ities of our cities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action under the au@@ spices of the I@@ HK and with many partners do also make clear that every citizen of his department store will influence the direct environment itself .

Tr@@ ump replaced following tran@@ sc@@ anned tran@@ scription from telephone call Mexico under pressure due to the payment of the border wall
tran@@ scription from telephone call between US president Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders from Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
on January 27 , Tr@@ ump in a telephone conversation with the Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto on the occasion to hear that he would not pay for a planned border wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the US president imp@@ lic@@ itly charged him , because he had publicly den@@ oun@@ ced the wall in public . according to reports , he said to him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you cannot say the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump started to build a wall campaign with promise to build a wall on the southern border of the USA , and swore to Mexico for the project .
tran@@ scription of his first appeal with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ les were also released and un@@ veil an exchange called .
Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr. Tort@@ ure said that there was a trade for the USA refugees to take over Australia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that the existence would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; di@@ cul@@ ous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that the existence would look like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after he had proposed a ban to res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees to the US . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Moo@@ res Ford massacre : activists lead r@@ amm@@ ical Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice again
a 1948 @-@ seater Ford Mercury went through a group of spectators in rural Monroe , Georgia , and shr@@ ink to the Ford Bridge by Moore .
before the car , the four black passengers and a white driver , the bridge could reach the bridge , a group of white men came with ri@@ fl@@ es to block his way .
the leader of the Mo@@ bs - a man @-@ aged @-@ aged @-@ aged ho@@ ist - took a long train to his cigarette and looked at the wind@@ shield .
in@@ doors the occup@@ ants in fear .
&quot; we want this n -@@ --- r Roger ! &quot; ro@@ aring the man .
&quot; get him from the car ! &quot;
scre@@ ams to silence , when a young black man was broken off from the passenger seat .
fortunately , this terrible scene was played on July 22 , only a re@@ appointment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; almost all in the audience were very real sig@@ h . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2005 , citizens came back to Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge to follow the night , in which two black pairs - Roger und Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com , as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - from K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one was charged for murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is truly unbe@@ atable that in all these years we have not been arrested in all these years , although we know who are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks that assi@@ sts in the organisation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a dirt on a history , but it is a burden to our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bro@@ oks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former Con@@ gres@@ s@@ led of Georgia and a life of citizens .
the subsequent call for him serves as a dramatic call for action , and represents an annual memory of the Monroe community that a wrong has never been corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to be prosec@@ utions , we want to be delivered , we want to be reconciliation , but first we need to receive righteousness , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot proceed to healing and reconciliation , until we receive justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a court physician puts a paper cloth on the dead body of a Moore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ch on July 27 , 1946 .
according to FBI files that were received by the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding county has been suspected .
but no one was charged ever .
although the susp@@ ects stay on the free foot since decades , Citi@@ zens give you the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch campaigns in the whole city was always known : policies and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court of Justice made a vote for the first time in Georgia to aband@@ on their voice in the summer .
approximately at the same time as choice of the FBI &apos;s label Roger Mal@@ com offers a white base @-@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a fight - supp@@ os@@ edly because of a woman .
Bro@@ oks said that rum@@ or was in the city that H@@ ester had slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy , and that baby she had , not from her husband .
on 25 July 1946 Lo@@ y Harrison , a prominent white landmark , 600 dollars to free Mal@@ col@@ m from prison , the FBI .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her cou@@ sins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey at the prison .
but when she was away from prison , the Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge drew near , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b reached the car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it looked , it was a Harrison , who prepared the mur@@ ders and arranged , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; includes a FBI report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there were a plot between government and local prosecution that had not only been involved in mur@@ ders , evi@@ den@@ oun@@ ce evidence and the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bro@@ oks formulated it even more fun .
&quot; it was a election of voting , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed , to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you register , and if you vote , this will happen here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for almost a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene headed the annual delivery of Moore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
their presentation is descri@@ p@@ tive , moving , and is justified in a kind of deep rac@@ ism , of which many believed that he has no longer exists in America .
it &apos;s hard to view , and more difficult to look , but Gre@@ ene said that the point is .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to speak about the Lyn@@ ch , because we are con@@ fron@@ ted with its wat@@ ery in us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I can &apos;t build a relation to you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or don &apos;t want to hear what I did . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production began in June , and the first day attracted nearly 30 actors - a dozen White and the rest black , as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ played overview of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ de@@ gh is here Gre@@ at@@ co @-@ director .
he has played the role of Chief Cl@@ an@@ member &apos;s role for years , but he said that he never become easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ de@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to receive this story , because we would not want to return to these times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room , the actor D@@ arri@@ us Brad@@ sh@@ aw and Nick Ras@@ ps , the Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester play their lines .
the piece starts with Mal@@ com , the H@@ ester &apos;s ser@@ en@@ ite and they pressed him , so that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; I said , n --- he , win@@ dy from my own property ! &quot;
Ras@@ mi@@ er@@ wi@@ es the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone breaks out ( at least all black actors ) .
Gre@@ ene laugh@@ s at most .
&quot; what ? ! &quot; he asked S@@ all@@ ying .
he is al@@ arms and conf@@ used .
was I too hard ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still k@@ ich@@ ever . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t believe that white people back then &apos; n --- &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; yet , &quot; swe@@ ating one of the other black actors .
&quot; you only need to meet the hard &apos; R. &apos; .
and exactly there is the energy in the room , a feeling of camera body replaces the dis@@ comfort .
everyone is now busy to get this right , not only because of the game , but also for the memory of the four killed people .
the scene begins once .
this time , when Ras@@ mi@@ ds says the N word , he predic@@ ts it sharp and with re@@ print .
absolutely no laugh@@ s .
this repe@@ ating is violent and quick .
there are scre@@ ams , nuts and then silence .
a woman , dressed with a wedding dress , is about the bodies of actors and leads to cheap holidays g@@ ing@@ de &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot;
their voice breaks at every second word .
about a hundred meters behind it , a group of about four dozen people get swe@@ at and tears from eyes .
the audience is almost equally between black and white .
a couple is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , traveled to see the performance , many are just down the road .
they experienced almost eight hours of Geor@@ gi@@ as inhibit@@ ing moisture , when Bro@@ oks leads them on a pilgrimage to the tomb of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
up to this point the mur@@ ders remained a A@@ nec@@ d@@ ote , but now if you were on the same country where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de took place , the air felt sin@@ ks .
if the last notes of the songs , Gre@@ ene invites the amount to come closer and inspec@@ ting the dead bodies .
children so@@ cks on their heads to register the f@@ ake blood and the st@@ oves body and whis@@ per@@ ing each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are not really dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mur@@ ders is a little boy , than that he would remember it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes , Gre@@ ene of the amount - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw the Lyn@@ x arrow away and wi@@ pe their tears .
Brad@@ sh@@ aw embra@@ ced Mar@@ de@@ gh , the man in the suit that the Cl@@ an member has played .
Nick S@@ all@@ ying arm@@ oured two of his fellow @-@ player and then breaks out in her arms , and the emotional load of the performance was finally destroyed by him .
&quot; it is okay , &quot; whis@@ per@@ ed one of women .
&quot; we know that this is not in your heart . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you have done this from a reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
later the audience reli@@ es together with the actors for dinner together .
in a table , a white pair of Atlanta stim@@ ulates over the post@@ ings with a black pair that they had just met .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fought words to inv@@ ent words , which has left the performance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... of people who look like yourself and those things , because they look like , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what do you really do with me , that the Lyn@@ ch is still going on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today it is called the police shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room , Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks farm stops on his table , eating and remin@@ is@@ cent of civil rights .
he said he began to plan the performance in the next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the desc@@ end@@ ment is inspir@@ ing in a certain way because it describes the terror of what we have borne , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s so if we do not learn it , then it will happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whoever does not study his own history , whoever does not know its own story , is sentenced to repeat them . &quot;

the audience was not just a form of peace with cast@@ orf , but it also has an understanding of its vision .
I draw a positive conclusion .
Max amount works as volunteers
they work in several places in their volunteer year .
where everywhere ?
amount : normally in Stein@@ furt in the furniture fair , once in the week I help here in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge .
and I have already worked at the open day at school .
how are your experiences yet ?
quantity : it &apos;s a nice , wide spectrum that I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
they are now 26 years , or a late volunteer volunteer .
how does that come ?
quantity : I made S@@ LC .
and then a civil engineering , let &apos;s say that we were lost successfully .
I knew for me that it is for me the fro@@ gs and I want to make something different to work with people .
and then I asked what do you do .
do a social year , there is an insight , there you can see how it is on site , in the focal point , maybe even , really .
and was it so ?
quantity : I collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the winter semester .
I will be dual study , probably a social worker training and study of students in Ham@@ m at the University of Applied Sciences .
is it not somewhat un@@ common to have several different fields for volunteers ?
quantity : Yes it is very variable .
it always comes on , where you will be his FS@@ Y .
you can make it from Alter@@ sheim to youth work - in all possible fac@@ ettes of social work .
with me it was very diversi@@ fied .
I also was in the O@@ gs , so in the afternoon care .
for me it was exactly the right thing that imag@@ ined me .
I could see my own strengths and see how it really runs .
differently than in civil engineering ?
quantity : well , here it is not to be reck@@ on@@ ably .
one always has another man &apos;s head , each of which have a very different history behind it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether a refugee , a youth who has been brought up out of the family - one must always enter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
very interesting .
and you had no contact anxi@@ ous ?
quantity : I am not the guy .
there is a field that gives a lot .
great love , much friendliness .
there are also negative moments , but so is that life .
Pear@@ son are over@@ thrown over 3,000 jobs and over@@ thrown the dividend to revi@@ ve the business .
the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday , they will cut further 3,000 jobs and cut their intermediate dividend by 72 percent , as another restructuring program may be started to overcome the pressure , with which the company is con@@ fron@@ ted .
the spac@@ ing that Director General John Fall@@ on announced mainly for the end of 2018 and early 2019 , comes in addition to its previous restructuring , which already lost 4.000 jobs .
Pear@@ son announced plans in May in a third cost reduction programme to cost another 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by fast step towards digital learning .
the company , that had sold its shar@@ ehol@@ ding in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House at Ber@@ tel@@ smann , said that the outlook for the business year was unchanged , after it achieved an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds .
Kon@@ vo@@ i attack by Kabul : NATO soldier killed at suicide attacks
a suicide bom@@ bers attacked a military con@@ voy at Afghan capital Kabul , killing a soldier of NATO and several others viol@@ ates officials .
five soldiers and an interpre@@ ter have been viol@@ ated in NATO as a NATO statement .
un@@ approved local reports were killed by the incident in the Q@@ Arab , also three civilians .
the bombing is the last violence that Afghanistan hit this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Her@@ at .
on Monday , a self @-@ murder killed two people near the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul .
in a statement of Nato &apos;s it is to be done , the explosion occurred on Thursday evening when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afghan army was attacked and attacked . &quot;
the statement is saying that all the subjects are in a stable condition and will be treated at the U.S. military hospital on Bag@@ ram .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and group which is known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h , a great concern for NATO troops in nearby Bag@@ ram .
according to UN United Nations , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian cas@@ u@@ alties in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % of them in the capital .
at the end of July , a suicide lor@@ om@@ be killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shi@@ ite district of Kabul .

the violence under@@ lines the pre@@ m@@ ise safety situation in Afghanistan , as U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump is considering to increase the number of U.S. troops to assist military and police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say that the suicide attacks in Kabul may also have a crisis of public confidence in the government , its policies and especially in the call of President Ash@@ raf Gh@@ ani .
EPA returns to the delay of the smo@@ g rule to K@@ lagen
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has made a decision to rev@@ oked the government of Obama &apos;s government , that the states are obliged to prevent smo@@ g @-@ caused emissions to prevent smo@@ g @-@ caused emissions . this was a day after 15 states accused the agency because of the st@@ ep@@ per .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EP@@ O announced late in Wednesday the decision to drive the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oz@@ on@@ regulations 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are committed to the obligation of the agency to collabor@@ ate with states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue with and that we react to our State partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA chef Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in a declaration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt was announced in June the intention of EPA , the O@@ zone provisions - in which a part of the country would have to be noted , to determine where in@@ cis@@ ions must be entered , to keep the stric@@ ter air quality standards - delayed by October 2018 .
a group of 15 mostly democratic states together with the district of Colombia , filed an attempt on Tuesday , and said that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to impos@@ e a wide range of environmental conditions that the former president Barack Obama has set up economic growth as part of a wider agenda , which should boost economic growth according to Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effort however triggered the impact of the Democrats and reserves , who are concerned about the impact of greater emissions on public health . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the C@@ EP@@ s website says that the in@@ hal@@ ation of air , the o@@ zone contains &quot; the lung function , and intensi@@ fy the re@@ spir@@ atory symptoms , such as as@@ thma .
joint hall wants a common room
at the end , the decision was made clear : with two counter@@ parts , the municipal council of Flu@@ ff win@@ nings decides to establishing a community area in future senior citizens .
in front of discussion there is an important information : the purchase agreement for the still missing plot was signed , may@@ ors Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although there is still no planning to the church community until now there is no planning event for this by a private investor to st@@ em@@ m@@ ating project more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is a discussion regarding a common room .
one of the two investors who are still in the ship , offered to meet the congregation .
on the ground floor he would provide a living space of approximately 55 square meters - and a adjacent terrace with all 70 square metres of space available for a special price .
to manage the administration and majority of the Municipal Council , such a community space is not a meeting place just for the residents of sen@@ i@@ or@@ en@@ ne@@ at residence , but open to the municipality .
for example , the word made by the &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; in round .
the decision , which was decided by the provision of funding for the current budget in the past fall , has been decided by funding .
construction is in the renovation area .
the establishment of a shared space would be reported that T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 percent of 30 percent .
the resolution proposal provides to signal the investor to signal its legs in this regard , giving him no b@@ ill@@ el between the legs of both sem@@ it@@ rail@@ ers - as well as P@@ ult@@ d@@ ach - what the tr@@ inal height reduces and the construction of an economic power - it would be possible .
not necessary , this is not only Wil@@ fried Soh@@ o , be this additive .
if it helps : unanimously he succe@@ eds the panel .
it is not so simple to common room .
Daniela &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Daniela Call to the many own buildings , with whom you &apos;re not going on with the common room from the window , says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not make me hard with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ v@@ onne Sta@@ iger speaks absolutely for the common room - but absolutely against a municipal participation .
it looks behind it a covered payout of the amount of Foreign Invest@@ ors .
this is not so , because with the acquisition of the area you give no sub@@ sid@@ y , but get a real , in the case of doubt the market@@ able value , the counter shall be contra@@ sted .
Sta@@ ig@@ ator motion , the decision accordingly to the decision , three advoc@@ ates are found .
for example , with two counter@@ parts in the original program , Stefan H@@ aller summar@@ ises : &quot; if we miss the decision , we make a huge step to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot;

to the star in the resin of Stern
in the Har@@ z , the nationwide &quot; star@@ ring ad &quot; is scheduled to emer@@ ge .
this is the association Z@@ ob@@ servatory Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a planetary trip there in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star@@ ring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; come to meet the information needs of many Har@@ z@@ visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he connected nature , science , movement , and sporting performance .
members want to present along the planned route boards and inform about stars and stell@@ ations .
in the first phase until 2018 the association is planning &quot; well @-@ achiev@@ able installations in five to six locations &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z .
inquire at St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ e@@ ge@@ i@@ ß and Sie@@ ber .
the information on the boards should be supplem@@ ented by the Internet .
therefore a good mobile network is playing with the site selection .
accessi@@ bility is a crit@@ erion .
later the star Train Station is to be extended by train .
&quot; on the star@@ ring , see the viewer &apos;s consider@@ ations , for example , about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; explained the association .
in addition , they learned about that stars might have different colors or why a star stronger than another , although it is much more distant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also , in which constellation can find out a selected star and see when he is best to see . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association already operates in the mountain town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg since 2014 , the highest con@@ servatory in northern Germany .
according to the Federal Office of Natural Conservation , the location in the middle of the national park of Har@@ z is one of the six deep dar@@ k@@ est regions in Germany .
often from there the milk road and even the Andro@@ med@@ a galax@@ y with naked eye can be seen clearly .
since 2003 there has been a little similar to the initiative of the Planet@@ arium Organ@@ izer initiative since 2003 .
starting in front of the Hotel in Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planetary track leads up to Hain@@ berg and the ob@@ servatory , as well as an &quot; alien &quot; location in the emar@@ ks ( municipality of Glei@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the st@@ els with the individual planet - including the P@@ lu@@ to d@@ warf @-@ sided p@@ lu@@ to the end point - have exactly the distance and a scale of one to two billion .
the earth sh@@ run@@ k so on a ball of 6.5 millimeters in diameter , while the sun measures exactly 70 centi@@ metres from the sun .
the total distance of the planet amount is about four kilometers .
while the light from sun to the P@@ lu@@ to takes about eight hours , pede@@ stri@@ ans need a good hour to st@@ ele with p@@ lu@@ to .
the pedestrian is faster than the light in the world .
the march to the next fixation should last a half year .

&quot; I &apos;m a former spring @-@ weight &quot; remin@@ ded Gar@@ cia .
&quot; I got up for Bri@@ oner &#91; on 140 lbs &#93; , but I am not so big .
I am small for 140 .
I want to download the light weight .
and he must move to lightweight design &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then fight .
this will ask the fans .
let &apos;s give it to them . &quot;
Lom@@ ak@@ enko endor@@ sed .
&quot; boxing needs this struggle . &quot;
climate change asked if it should be at pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko must fight with a 135 pound debut in this year to agree on the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Campbell in the forum on September 23rd .
&quot; this battle could take place in the pay @-@ per @-@ view mode because all fans asked after him , &quot; said Gar@@ cia and I pressed later to fight with the network which offers the best financial package .
we are the best .
no other names can produce this type of attention .
when ever they are ready ... &quot;
Gar@@ cia said he sh@@ ak@@ eth Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; an enormous fighter , &quot; and he may take part in his Saturday fight .
but Lom@@ ak@@ enko gave the generous praise to Gar@@ cia and said that he think the tri@@ athlon champion made out of River@@ side , &quot; sorry that I &apos;m sorry for Mik@@ ey ... you wanted to get the K@@ o @-@ Off . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said the focus is to show stroke strength , then boxing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both they said they could feel that Mom@@ entum , which had grown up for their own struggle .

no other fight creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am more than happy to work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lom@@ nick@@ enko said : &quot; I have been waiting for the top fighter , and this is Mik@@ ey .

four last tire fin@@ ders
on Thursday afternoon , four people were injured as part of an accident on the A7 .
after the first information , the driver of a Opel Z@@ af@@ ira lost at 16.30 in front of the connection station , probably after a tire storage it will be controlled by his vehicle .
the passenger car went right into the h@@ ill@@ side where he beat down and then remained on the roof in the gr@@ ale attack .
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were seriously injured during the accident .
during the first supply of the emergency service , the A7 was locked in direction north for about an hour , then the traffic could be enclosed on the left road at the accident place .
Fort@@ y Hoffmann : &quot; Dre@@ aming chain works better &quot;
Andre Hoffmann hopes for the 2 : 2 to the season open@@ er , that the optimis@@ ation of the def@@ ensive information takes place in Au@@ e points .
with the first season , Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the result , as did not the two oppos@@ ites were in the 2 : 2 before Brun@@ swi@@ ck .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the two oppos@@ ites were too much , and we have to fit in au@@ e even better , &quot; says the def@@ ensive player from Fortuna Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Erz@@ gebirge , the thresh@@ ing chain should also be optimised .
and a fool according to a fre@@ eze , they don &apos;t want to keep the f@@ ences .
&quot; for the future , there will be so no more besides Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) on line . &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team will improve even after the experiences in preparation with the turning chain better than with the quad@@ rup@@ ette .
&quot; I don &apos;t know how we &apos;re in au@@ e , &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm radio , but Hoffmann is certainly in his cause , &quot; because we just got up on the half chain in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and N@@ iko G@@ ie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann players who can build up well , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a prer@@ equ@@ is@@ ite for us , but that we don &apos;t want to harmon@@ ize and make us not so many ab@@ ling errors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course Hoffmann also goes to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you cannot speak after a mis@@ sl@@ ant start , don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the performance could be quite okay , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we will focus on Sunday with four points and we will focus on the poker championship , we will certainly be able to talk of a regular season open@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of them his trainer wanted nothing to know .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the start into the season I evaluated only after six to eight playing days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fried@@ helm radio , who would not speak of an advantage over aud@@ e , only because the game of Saxony had to be cancelled due to an un@@ certainty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they can start the season with a home game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the player from Au@@ e might even be something of fresh , since they had no heavy and full game like Fortuna against an asc@@ ending f@@ avo@@ red . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they don &apos;t know as 100 percent where they are currently &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the inner def@@ enders of the Fortuna . &quot; &quot; &quot;
indeed , guests from the Rhineland , as light favorite on Sunday in the infinite ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we have removed it , only because we have the right to come under the first six , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Funk@@ el &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says radio , whose balance is quite positive with only one defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there is no crew in the 2 . Bundesliga , which one must strike in advance , &quot; explains Fort@@ y chef .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such a statement would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ar@@ ro@@ gant , &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and so will Funk@@ el be able to see his player on Sunday .
new results of the Swedish asylum Review Days released
the latest results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , which were subjected to a new method to medical evaluation of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested people are older than 18 years of age . however , everyone may believe on the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish authorities for For@@ ens@@ ische Medicine ( with the growing number ) has begun with the implementation of the tests last year .
they are to be more precise during the asylum procedure , after the Swedish migration ( Mig@@ rat@@ es@@ et@@ et ) was critic@@ ised for failure of some refugees because of the correct age of some refugees .
up to now , mig@@ rations 6.@@ 880 was sent to test@@ ant cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from the period from mid @-@ March to 31st July 2017 .
eighty percent ( 2002 ) were evaluated as 18 or older , while in other 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency reported that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
in 432 cases the conclusion that the person &quot; may be under 18 years old . &quot;
tests are carried out only in cases where the age of the person is question@@ ed .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are durable in the past months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t see any great difference in the statistics of the past months , the numbers are quite constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high percentage of cases where the person was judged as over 18 years , does not necessarily means that the asylum seek@@ ers has to be given over his age .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in May the agency released the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there would be 4@@ 42 cases that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; propose that the person was 18 years or older &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the newspaper sv@@ ens@@ ka D@@ ag@@ bla@@ det published the 5@@ 81 published results , noted that in 243 of these cases the person said frank@@ ly say that it will be 18 years old this year .
the method of medical age assessment , which are made with cor@@ onation of white teeth and MRI images , which are analyzed by dental doctors and radi@@ ologists , has also been critic@@ ised in some areas .
a sc@@ ep@@ tics is the end@@ ocr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ inska Institute , whose work covers the assessment of biological maturity of people to see whether they walked earlier or later than usually through the pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t believe that the type of measurement should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the biological age in this way is very un@@ certain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we cannot tell it , we should not do as if we could , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the newspaper Metro . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency def@@ ended the accuracy of tests : &quot; generally , you can say that the risk of judge a child as an adult is minimal .
the largest risk is in this case , if the person is under 18 , this is approximately 10 percent . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some people love gr@@ illed che@@ eses , and will eat it until the end of their lives . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I am in gr@@ illed cheese , I think , &apos; Oh that was cool , what comes next ? &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot;

after her separation , Kri@@ sten sum@@ med that they bis@@ exual : &quot; I always lived on du@@ alism and believed in the way .
so it has never been conf@@ used or handic@@ apped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I liked it just never , not seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bang show@@ piece &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but in school time , as they loved it as a bush : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this really has very hurt .
when I was 11 , the children , I would like to look like a book .
I felt really attacked , modified and disappointed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now I look back and say to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Girl , be proud of you ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially the public , they don &apos;t like to love their love : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people expect you to keep you in a certain way , and the off@@ end me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps , I call to describe me some friends , but I don &apos;t like to just@@ ify me before the public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; if you like it or not , the Democrats have removed from me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Governor Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and much re@@ thinking ... today I will tell you as a population of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you when I &apos;m a democratic governor . &quot;
the rally broke out in Ju@@ bel .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration for the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , &quot; he added Justice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a coach I would say that it is time to play another game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised before@@ hand a large announcement in the West Virginia Rally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia by 42 points and Justice has not endor@@ sed the democratic candidate Hill@@ ary Clinton in Hill@@ ary Clinton .

in the meantime , the Republi@@ can National Committee on Thursday evening a declaration in which it said : &quot; the party change of Governor Justice is another stroke for a Democratic Party which would rather go out to be our country again . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with only 15 g@@ re@@ ties and the intake of the least legal entities in the history , the announcement of Governor Justice is not able to find a positive , welcoming message , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the R@@ NC @-@ chairman R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel in a statement den C@@ BS News . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the worldwide b@@ oss of athlet@@ ics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised the Thursday that he described as an open ap@@ ologi@@ zing from Russia to a D@@ oping sc@@ andal , but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be resumed in the sport .
Russia &apos;s athlet@@ ics b@@ oss Dmit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ ak@@ ht@@ in said during the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of the World Athletics Championships , that the array of his country was correct and that he decided to fight the doping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all athletes participating at competitors &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gold and silver med@@ ail@@ out &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF @-@ Congress voted for maintaining a D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) in November 2015 , following a report by the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was a very open answer , a very hon@@ est presentation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF @-@ President Co@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the whole Council and the entire congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has experienced itself , that she has experienced some rather hot times and will all possible to ensure that the Federation is redesigned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said it is also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleased that Russia accept the criteria for its re @-@ introduction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it was a very construc@@ tive day , and I think that progress were achieved , but the congress only supports the recommendations of the Task Force , that this is not the moment to re@@ use Russia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must do everything in the next few months to norm@@ alize the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes of the dep@@ ra@@ ved system , &quot; he added
ninet@@ een Russian athletes are competing in the World Athletics Championships , which will begin on Friday in London after the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral actors .
the leader of the IA@@ AF @-@ Task Force , R@@ une Andersen , said on Monday that Russia must meet some of the criteria for a recovery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thr@@ illing tests are still in@@ adequate and forbidden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rep@@ orters in London after a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the ceremony took place in the cathedral city under high security deposits .
in addition , Ursula from the Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) , Minister President Ursula from the Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) said nothing too late .
but they called the two commented drivers but as &quot; C@@ ould of her specialist . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow before this highest victims , which they have produced in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , Kom@@ man@@ de@@ ur of the Reg@@ iment , said : &quot; if this crew could not drop down the crash , nobody could have been mo@@ red . &quot;
doub@@ ts at the UN Mission in Mali showed no doubt : the use of the Le@@ yen was dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he is also of high significance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country , from which we are only separated by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the fun@@ eral service the trap were brought to the cathedral .

Prince Hen@@ rik I want no tomb beside his wife
the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , will not be buried in his wife .
this was the royal house on Thursday .
traditionally , the Danish royal couple is buried in the cathedral of Ros@@ kil@@ de .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ ag@@ us for the two .
the queen , who understood the decision of her husband , was further notice in communication .
where Prince Hen@@ rik was buried , is still un@@ clear .
but he did not int@@ ent to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a Com@@ mit that he was not happy with his title .
he became king to the throne of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 .
in 2016 he retired and lays down the title &quot; princ@@ esses . &quot;
since Hen@@ rik in Denmark would not have the title and function which he wanted to see himself toward his wife - as well as , not after death , explained LE@@ NE Bal@@ le@@ by , the chief spokes@@ woman of the Danish king .
where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ olds should last finally be un@@ clear .
but he did not int@@ ent to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark .
he likes the country , for which he worked for the last 50 years .

he worked on the Th@@ ames in the French Embassy .
during his later woman the sympath@@ ies of the people always flo@@ or@@ ated , Prince Hen@@ rik had completed a heavy stand in his almost 50 @-@ year anniversary with the Dan@@ es .
in a auto@@ biography Hen@@ rik wrote about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did .
my Danish was s@@ lim@@ ming , I preferred wine instead of beer , soap sc@@ ur@@ fs instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Citroën instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , which I smo@@ ked instead of Virginia @-@ tobacco , which had been able to consider the participation of critical intellec@@ tu@@ als , I could not hope to return .
I was different .
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and will not be ashamed .
these were just two mist@@ akes ! &quot;
Prime Minister because I want a f@@ lap of re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP in@@ front of the possible majority in Lower Saxony
precip@@ itation of the Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) is after the loss of red @-@ green government relief for a rapid re @-@ election of the country , but he doesn &apos;t want to go back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because he spoke to the Parliament &apos;s dis@@ solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
previously , the surprising exit of a Green @-@ M@@ EP@@ s from its Land@@ during fra@@ ction in Lower Saxony had over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .
five months before the official date of the Parliament election the red @-@ green Coalition lost its scar@@ ce majority vote against the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the previous green members of El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ed founded its step by step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 election in Rot@@ enburg ( W@@ ü@@ m@@ me ) .
&quot; I see my political future in CD@@ U , &quot; declared it on Friday in Hanover .
CD@@ U @-@ Fra@@ ction Director Bj@@ örn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his Group to record it .
these CD@@ U and F@@ DP had 69 seats in the Lower Saxony &apos;s Parliament , SPD and Green 68 seats .
previously , the ratio was vice vers@@ a .
the new Parliament will be elected on 14th January next year .
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said the red @-@ green state government now decide whether they may continue to rule in this situation without a majority .
and Stephan Weil , however , is advis@@ able that the Parliament today appro@@ ached its self @-@ resolution quickly .
the CD@@ U Group is expected to decide on a further notice on Tuesday .
the state of the country also sees the possibility that the Parliament &apos;s State President draws confidence and cho@@ oses a successor to the Prime Minister &apos;s prime minister .
&quot; our Constitution offers several options .
these possibilities must be legally clean , &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you shall inherit all the questions if they are legally approved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ west@@ ward Step &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but slightly cur@@ i@@ os &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the policy was stressed : &quot; I &apos;m not a betra@@ yer .
I feel very good . &quot;
it designated as a trailer from black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens called for the back@@ sliding dep@@ uties for the return of its land meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course we assume that she has received her land at the green congress , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shared the President Meta Janssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Group &apos;s president Anja P@@ iel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we regre@@ t the decision of El@@ ke T@@ ry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she decided not to lead a foreign language in the fra@@ ction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even before the background , there was no content differences , we cannot im@@ itate this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
SPD Socialist candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the survivors of the Lower Sax@@ on Green @-@ dep@@ uties El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets to the CD@@ U as a betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Beh@@ avi@@ or of the former Green @-@ M@@ EP@@ s in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal to voters and voters , but also the Council of Red @-@ Green , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the Social Democrats &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday to Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he re@@ ject the decision by Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) to re @-@ elect the Parliament .
the exit T@@ west@@ ward costs Red @-@ Green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the politicians in its last emot@@ ion and their personal interests in sight of the country &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; critic@@ ised SPD @-@ General Hu@@ ber@@ tus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; peace offerings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony makes this dirty In@@ tri@@ bution and tries to beat out the political capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
precip@@ itation of the CD@@ U fra@@ ction Bj@@ örn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his M@@ EP@@ s , El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets to the CD@@ U .
according to the Bundestag &apos;s fra@@ ction of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , his li@@ fe@@ jack@@ ets , dra@@ fted the outcome of the Parliament election in 2013 .
the CD@@ U was the strongest force , SPD and Green in front of the SPD in the country but had a thin @-@ thin majority of one voice .
interview in the Interview - How do we protect ourselves from Gi@@ ft@@ ei@@ ern , Mr. Schmidt ?
Germany disc@@ usses about sigh@@ ed eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how consumers can protect consumers .
Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) Agriculture Minister ( CS@@ U ) is an interview with the editor of Germany ( R@@ ND ) statement and answer .
Mr. Schmidt , how can the consumer protect yourself from po@@ is@@ oned eggs ?
I encourage you to see all consumers and consumers to check the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp pressure .
the Bundes@@ länder will be presenting the latest news on the affected eggs on the fuel market : www.@@ food war@@ th@@ qu@@ .de .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
too , if after all we know , health haz@@ ard is practically excluded .
now Al@@ di takes over the best possible crisis @-@ action - all the eggs out of the offer - because the central role of recon@@ n@@ aissance from the Federal Minister of Industry is not really perceived ?
the food monitoring is the task of the states .
nevertheless , my house has to be switched off immediately and is located since the dis@@ armament of Germany in a close exchange with the authorities of the countries .
all the information and the risk assessment are available to consumers .
the trade is the same as the manufacturers to ensure that the sold are traffic @-@ capable and health harm@@ less .
if for eggs , the resi@@ sting content of 0.0@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded , these are not traffic .
however , un@@ loaded eggs can be sold and eaten .
these times are not the establishments .
are factories and consumers in the same boat ?
according to actual evidence , production companies will not be an immediate debt .
indeed , it must be liable to the alleged illegal practices of service companies with economic losses due to alleged illegal practices .
as always , there is a little control in harvest .
is it lack@@ ed on personnel or also in the s@@ elling jurisdiction ?
there were just the official controls which revealed the process .
however , the truth belongs to the truth , however , that food and criminal energy can never be excluded at 100 per cent .
just this reason a consistent adv@@ ancement of such services and hand@@ over to the public prosecutor in cases where criminal off@@ ences can be of decisive importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have already made several times that I &apos;m interested by the responsible authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
is the regular alarm extre@@ mis@@ m really necessary in the food industry ?
consumer consumers have the right to receive solely secure and market@@ able food .
if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ ci@@ de is used in the food industry , consumer goods and consumers are un@@ affected .
by f@@ aded resources , manufacturers , merchants and consumers have not been in a situation that is absolutely not necessary .
basically , it must be clear : the un@@ lawful use of the insec@@ ti@@ ci@@ de Fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of li@@ ve@@ able animals is not acceptable and must be terminated immediately .
it has to be consistently consistent with high pressure on all levels .
I &apos;m expecting from all relevant authorities that the atomic fact is un@@ resolved and rep@@ lic@@ ated .
how can the soccer rules of football on N@@ ey@@ m@@ ars move to Paris
the rules , which aim to prevent un@@ explained issues of European football , N@@ ey@@ m@@ ars World Record @-@ Transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain will not distur@@ b .
any consequences will come to Paris Saint @-@ Germain , because the introductory organisation , which monitors the European game , has the power , teams of access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial @-@ Play @-@ rules , which were launched in 2011 from UEFA EURO , meant that PS@@ G has to re@@ prove at some point that the transfer of N@@ ey@@ mar has been financed without large losses .
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ( 262 million dollars ) to get out of Brazil out of his contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary which will amount to several ten million dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ m@@ ars Mov@@ ing to France .
PS@@ G can loose the money that &apos;s loose the money , that N@@ ey@@ mar writes and bring him into a galax@@ y of other stars , given the financing of the team due to the energy @-@ rich ruler of Qatar .
associations may apply for the purchase of players a lot of money , but must legitim@@ ate the break @-@ even point in their work on the football @-@ related business .
the FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEFA President in 2007 .
the former French player believed that clubs , who in their stre@@ w@@ ns had taken tremend@@ ous debt , effectively fr@@ au@@ dul@@ ging and ris@@ ked up to ru@@ in@@ ize , if banks or owners declined their support .
in 2011 FF@@ P conf@@ essed from the concentration on the debts of clubs on the monitoring of their losses .
the change meant that the model model , the novel Ab@@ r@@ amo@@ vich originally used in Chelsea - purchased a club with potential and then invested in order to build the team and to build a global stamp - at a har@@ der matter .
during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P crime period , which runs until 2018 , clubs may take losses of EUR 30 million .
and although Plat@@ ini &apos;s 2015 has fallen from the presidency to un@@ gn@@ ade , his UEFA successor Ale@@ ks@@ ander Ce@@ fer@@ in continues to make sure to make sure they are lost .
&quot; certainly , FF@@ P isn &apos;t dead and we will strengthen the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for FF@@ P , opposed to The Associated Press in the past week .
although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a package , it may distribute the amount for the invoice about the duration of his contract .
N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year agreement , so that the sol@@ uble contract for the next five years can be submitted in the amount of EUR 4@@ 4.4 million in the annual financial statements .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has hit the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the heavy sanctions .
PS@@ G received a fine of 60 million euros ( then 82 million dollars ) , which was later reduced to EUR 20 million - and it was ordered that the teams for the Champions League of the season 2014 / 15 will be limited to 21 players instead of the ordinary 25 players .
the UEFA is looking for clubs , who could try to over@@ sight its financial vision by firm their income by companies that are connected to the owners of a club .
while a cat@@ ar@@ act company could be spontaneous if the value of the Spon@@ sor@@ ship should exceed the default market rates , the UEFA dies would not apply as legitim@@ ate income .
exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the importance of the Spon@@ sor@@ ship of Qatar was re@@ pro@@ stit@@ ched by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it has reported that a part of PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar can be obtained via payments of the German World Cup in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar was con@@ tested that N@@ ey@@ mar World Cup will be able to figure out a such man@@ eu@@ vers for the UEFA regulatory authorities .
the current sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEFA will still be more effective , try to observe the rules .
the UEFA had no prepared talks with PS@@ G via N@@ ey@@ m@@ ars Transfer , legendary on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .
they spoke in the condition of the onym@@ ity with The Associated Press , as they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the last published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 has generated revenue of € 54@@ 2.4 million for a profit of more than 10 million euros .
the accounts for the last financial year must be published .
PS@@ G expects that N@@ ey@@ m@@ ars arrive a blessing for Spon@@ sor@@ ing De@@ als , merch@@ an@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ k@@ ot@@ ting purchases .
the association continues to increase sales by at least 30 per cent after the signing of the signature .
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated , one of the best soccer players to see , and tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ m@@ ars way to prevent N@@ ey@@ m@@ ars shif@@ ting that PS@@ G would viol@@ ate the FF@@ P .
&quot; it is a clear@@ er case of &quot; financial intermedi@@ ation &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the President of La League , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS related to Kat@@ ars .
Arsenal @-@ manager Ar@@ s@@ ene W@@ enger , whose club is owned by an American sport @-@ ty@@ co@@ ons , divi@@ des the reservations of La League against a State who financed an association .
&quot; it is the consequence of the owner and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; said W@@ enger on Thursday .
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible .
it will be very difficult to respect the Financial Fair@@ play because one can do different ways or different interests if a country has a great actor , to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new g@@ og@@ g@@ il@@ ant
in the past few years Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y board chocolate was produced for Swiss .
now the co @-@ operation is before a possible end : the airline writes the order .
Swiss spokes@@ woman Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ p confirmed on request of the News Agency S@@ DA under the corresponding report of the newspaper &quot; Northern Switzerland &quot; from Friday .
according to the current planning , the airline will conclu@@ de a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
all products would be reviewed and check in quality for two to three years .
&quot; we are very satisfied with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; said the spokesperson .
some 17 million small red @-@ red wra@@ pping panels are distributed at 14 grams per year the flight att@@ endant in front of the landing on passengers .
above the cost , Swiss Life wanted to make no information .
&quot; &quot; &quot; industry in@@ ks estimate the volume of volume according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Northern Switzerland &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of about one billion Swiss francs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but more important is all@@ em@@ ally of the public@@ ity effect : for a bu@@ og@@ gi@@ vest , it is a pre@@ stige job .
how many applicants are in the new call , the Swiss does not want to betra@@ y .
but only Swiss manufacturers are only
according to the newspaper article , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make a renewal of the Treaty on the spring of 2018 .
the S@@ DA was the largest Swiss chocolate @-@ manufacturer to be reached in a position statement .
chocolate coating distri@@ butes Swiss Life since 2006 on board their flights .
before Swiss had completed a contract with the Mig@@ ros daughter , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut comes in collaboration with Hu@@ g the chocolate tablets .
the possibility to place the logo brought Swiss on two and a half years with the start of collaboration with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline works together with different Swiss chocolate producers .
to long @-@ distance flights the customers of First Class with le@@ ak@@ e@@ ders are spo@@ iled by Con@@ fis@@ erie Spr@@ ün@@ gli , in the Business Class n@@ ags passengers Sch@@ og@@ gi von Lin@@ dt and in the Economy Class Sch@@ og@@ gi of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .

&quot; First Day of Camp &quot; held sur@@ prisingly good , not just because of his ab@@ sur@@ d Hum@@ ors ( it contained a original story for a speaking tin vegetables that was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .

impact on drugs @-@ Mafia in the country
the police have a blow against the Italian Mafia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning , in the Black Forest @-@ Ba@@ ar district , in Rot@@ tw@@ ald , Kon@@ stanz , Esslingen and Stuttgart were searched with numerous objects , as the public prosecutor &apos;s office opened on Friday .
however , in the age of 25 the accused were arrested and re@@ issued an arrest warran@@ ts for these arrest warran@@ ts .
in addition , the civil servants set up mar@@ i@@ ju@@ ana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms and several hundred thousand Euros are safe .
at the same Raz@@ zi@@ en in Italy , two persons were arrested .
there were German warran@@ ts against the two susp@@ ects .
the two will probably be extra@@ d@@ ited to Germany .
in the promotion , Italian and Bavarian investigations were involved .
more than 300 polic@@ emen were in use .
the members of the Mafia , organised drug crimin@@ ality , severe violence , attempted murder , as well as rob@@ ber@@ y and rob@@ ber@@ y .
since the summer of 2016 , the public prosecutor &apos;s office has been investig@@ ating drug traff@@ icking in the South German space .
between the public prosecutor in Kon@@ stanz and Palermo a real exchange and investig@@ ator of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ tw@@ eil had nearly daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
therefore , the large operations on Wednesday morning was accompanied by four civil servants from Palermo on Wednesday morning .
in the vision of investigations , Italian nationals combined with respect to Italian m@@ af@@ ia .
also a incident happened on the 27th of May in hat@@ s , where there were several shots to a restaurant early in the morning could go to the bank account .
how large g@@ aps compl@@ ained in the aliens @-@ register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data of citizens who should not dive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : a report according to a report showing considerable defects in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lead to partly grave failure on asylum procedures .
the Federal Commissioner for the refugee management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , has been aler@@ ted to a media report on large g@@ aps in the country &apos;s ec@@ centric register .
&quot; &quot; &quot; short@@ com@@ ings in the field of registered data may lead for asylum procedures and shi@@ fts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to partly grave failure &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; used in an analysis which is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the register , ten million people are recorded with foreign nationality , including 5.7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
the data is therefore managed by approximately 600 foreign authorities in Germany .
because the data is not sufficient enough , the data quality in parts so far been not good .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in individual cases , data from 1921 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from people who have long not been in life , or by citizens , who had become German citizens and should actually never immer@@ se more in the register . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; error data processing can be slow@@ down significantly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the statistics &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; official people are listed above all EU citizens who would not have to travel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; such false orders led , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to a deliber@@ ate debate on the handling of immigration , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it is in the analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the Federal Government has evi@@ d@@ ently started to return to Italy with their 16 @-@ year @-@ old children when they entered Italy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it emerg@@ es from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( B@@ AM@@ F ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Neue Osn@@ ab@@ dom@@ eter newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the paper , it is said that B@@ AM@@ F enables such procedures &quot; to families with children - with the exception of infants and infants - after Italy as of June 1 , 2017 . &quot;
since the end of 2014 , it was practically no longer possible , the newspaper under reference to the difficult situation on site .
after the Dublin treaty is responsible for refugees from the EU state to reach it first .
if a mig@@ rant wants to travel into another EU country , this state may return him into the trav@@ ail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the company now write : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , the admission fee for families with minor children in Italy has been considerably increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Italy have released for the recording and accommodation of families guaranteed .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( EG@@ M@@ R ) is sufficient for claims .
other EU countries would also return home in the context of the Dublin @-@ agreement .
the political office of the Left Party in the Bundestag , Ul@@ la Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised these decision : &quot; families with children thre@@ aten the lack of emergency conditions for lack of emergency conditions and endang@@ ering the child &apos;s disease . &quot;
second best result achieved
in a total of 220 litres of blood , the blood don@@ or service was already provided for other people .
at least of the twelve citizens , who were awarded on Friday .
now , Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who now sold 100 liters of blood in the meantime , is now leading by Jürgen Gre@@ ule .
traditionally , the municipality made the majority @-@ fold will@@ ing@@ ness to don@@ ate blood in the session of the Municipal Council .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is gen@@ ial , how our body is created and we have respect the desire of respect , which their blood is available for strangers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under@@ lined mayor of Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a single blood don@@ ating helps several people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the county manager of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Ma@@ is@@ enb@@ acher , for the con@@ serv@@ atives are divided into their components . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so could three people take advantage of a blood don@@ ating .
in the same time , Ma@@ is@@ enb@@ acher was reported by the actions which are carried out in Ober@@ feld@@ enbach in spring .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year we generated the second best result with 114 players , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the DR@@ K rotary leader . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously the change into the theatre house has led to high participants a few years ago .

the Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce that the interest rates remain unchanged since the weak economic growth and the atten@@ u@@ ation of inflation have subdu@@ ed over a rise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England warned that economic growth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will remain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they held the interest rates on family income in the middle of a intensi@@ fied pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the policy @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank , with 6 to 2 , increasing interest rates to 0.25 % , whereby the weak economic growth has weak@@ ened its support for an increase in the weak economic growth .
in its quar@@ terly annual inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth progn@@ osis for 2017 to 1.7 % and for 2018 at 1.6 % , while inflation would continue to continue on household income , while the fall of the fall is expected to rise to almost 3 % .
but it sign@@ alled that in the next few years of interest rate would be necessary to im@@ print the level of inflation and it said that the loan cost may be more than expected to rise to financial markets .
the members are also able to return a part of the Mamm@@ ut @-@ economic par@@ c@@ ets that was published before a year after Bre@@ x@@ it .
it will demand time to al@@ locate the financial plan for banks , although it was said that it is expected to provide 15 billion pounds more than the system at this system - with 115 billion pounds sterling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the central forecast of M@@ PC , gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak , since pressure on the real income of households will continue to be charged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; to the interest rates , they repeated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a certain stra@@ ction of monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the cooling of inflation and a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; somewhat bigger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be expected when the markets are expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the markets currently forecast the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank emphas@@ ized that increases &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gradually &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; limits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bank &apos;s forecast for this and next year &apos;s growth forecast down@@ wards in May was 1.9 % and 1.7 % compared to the growth forecast in May .
it maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the Po@@ unds fell after these messages compared to the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 Euro .
the decision at no change occurs after the most dis@@ appointing year growth pay the rising expectations and GDP in the second quarter of 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % .
growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it is slightly delayed by the end of the year .
the most recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households , which will be affected by increasing inflation and small sal@@ aries , since the disappearance of first being even worse before it will be repaired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that monetary policy is not &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to prevent income in the next years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they added that wages paid for the end of their three @-@ year forecast &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods , which is due to the weak Po@@ unds , which is compens@@ ated for a lower consumer expenditure .
the decision is one year following the lowering of interest rates on 0.25 % in the last August following the sho@@ cking EU vote , which caused the sin@@ king of the f@@ isheries .
the Bank estimates that it will take four years until the prices and the economy will be completely reached .
prior to the last judgment of the bank , the call had increased to interest rates , as inflation increased its pressure on hard @-@ related households , having called three political decision makers in July an increase to 0.5 % .
the inflation dropped from 2.9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the Bank predicted that it was expected to put on again in the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said , the exceeding the ratio in relation to its goal of 2 % is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be weak &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the weak Po@@ unds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Andrew Mont@@ lake , director at Co@@ rec@@ o mort@@ gage bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the recent recovery of s@@ wap rates , the mort@@ gage market should be more competitive , since the credit card is looking for a positive way after shops and end the year in positive way .
the market looks particularly good for those who exp@@ ires the existing De@@ als and the new Mort@@ g@@ ages , and many with toll @-@ free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) should rub against HIV @-@ drug HIV drug .
in September , following a fight against the financing of the drug in N@@ HS , patients will receive access to &quot; Trans@@ itional &quot; HIV @-@ prevention treatment .
N@@ HS England announced that an inhibit@@ ing disease recorded in front of the lov@@ em@@ aking risk ( Pr@@ EP ) that can reduce the risk of infection in high risk analysis by around 86 percent , now from the health service to a first three @-@ year study for an estimated 10,000 people .
he declared himself to finance the trial after the Court of Appeal confirmed a judgment of the Supreme Court in the past year , that the N@@ HS had to pay the powers to finance the Local Auth@@ orities that the local authorities should finance him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he announced by N@@ HS England CEO Simon Stev@@ ens on Thursday as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; important new intervention &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was welcomed during the National Aids Trust ( NAT ) as a &quot; decisive moment &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Brigh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be among the first belong to the registration of people , and further clinics will follow in October 2018 before it will be introduced in the whole England in April 2018 .
pre@@ ex@@ foli@@ ation hy@@ la@@ xes ( Pr@@ EP ) is a result of HIV samples that are taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that Pr@@ EP significantly reduced the HIV transmission in Inf@@ ection endangered .
pris@@ EP in front of intercourse means that just enough medicines will be present in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection .
such medicines can be taken every day or so two hours before sexual intercourse .
to those who are question@@ ed in question , are s@@ own or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexual and individuals with HIV @-@ positive partners who were not successfully treated .
in clinics , suitable participants are identified , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al treatment .
people who live in England and registered at a household in England , can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sexual clin@@ ics .
the program will be signed at £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply drugs this week after an international competitive proc@@ urement .
the study is to assess the entire potential of Pr@@ EP by implementing clinical evidence , as indicated in a large scale , recorded and implemented .
Stev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention should add the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV .
it is a further milestone in the more than three decades of continuing progress in compliance with one of the greatest health challenges of humanity . &quot;
Deb@@ orah Gold , Chief Executive at NAT ( National Aids Trust ) , said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .
Pr@@ EP , if it is targeted in need for needy and vulner@@ able people , offers the possibility to change the English HIV epide@@ mic .
from September to people with high HIV risk access to this N@@ HS @-@ financed attempt in England to develop a new instrument , which is really individual controls and not with a negoti@@ ation with a partner is subject to improving many lives .
we warm@@ ly welcome this announcement . &quot;
Ian Green , Chairman of the Min@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; the priority must now lie on that the study is carried out rapidly throughout the country and that nobody has left a risk for HIV .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now , as the Pr@@ EP test medicine was purchased , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ infected people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sharon Ho@@ dg@@ son , Shadow of the Health Minister , said : &quot; the beginning of the Pr@@ EP @-@ trial is to be invited and over@@ due after months of delay and late implementation .
the evidence shows how to be transformed this drug as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to the understanding of the Adv@@ ant@@ ages of Pr@@ ison .
now it is important that this study will be carried out as fast as possible in the whole country to protect people who are infected with HIV , and that it will be responsible for the termination of dissem@@ ination of HIV in society . &quot;
the large life @-@ life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have transformed this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment in a generous home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , reduced from a large house in Kn@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court apartment in 2014 .
it is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne @-@ terrace - and it &apos;s a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne had not packed her bags and sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before , with my former in Kn@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge , I lived in a much bigger space , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jo@@ anne says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I searched for something that was comparable to my prize .
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court and had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I love me in love and made a quote on this day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first tour the 1.000 square foot has been completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ room property with a scra@@ per layout - one had to go through the kitchen to enter into the bedroom - wanted to add Jo@@ anne Stau@@ ff@@ room and a mezzanine to make the generous ceiling height optimal .
&quot; I wanted to have high ceilings , large windows , a lot of light .
this was my request , &quot; says it .
to this end she commissioned the Architecture and Design Studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi in Notting Hill , the 12,5 foot high ceilings and a home that was not just a development but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms to place one another , so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could be .
Er@@ fan had to think creative , to solve the award .
&quot; the steel plant is quite complicated , &quot; he explains .
&quot; we had to arrange the rooms so arrange that they had to be stacked on each other , without having to decor@@ ate us .
it wasn &apos;t just to build a simple platform , but to put the steel so that it had the right height for the top or below . &quot;
this arrangement enabled us to place Er@@ fan , two rooms in full height to place each other - with a lot of additional drama .
the mezzanine sla@@ b a classic copper cable from retro@@ vi@@ vi@@ us to the gl@@ am@@ ous living area .
mir@@ ro@@ red gold furniture , silver acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting the style for the program .
the use of mirrors plays a role in Adding Theatre , Space and Light .
at both ends , a short cor@@ ridor is mir@@ ro@@ red to leave it longer .
in the kitchen the mir@@ r@@ oring feels like a window in another room .
at the entrance , pi@@ eg@@ ged units offer space for all the corner and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
by perception of a gl@@ am@@ our@@ more space , the beauty of the rooms can complete the kitchen , when it is not used .
assem@@ ble kitchens are nothing new .
so special about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a little engineering art came in , &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the steel ampli@@ fied , vene@@ ered MDF door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not important to push the door , if you push the door , very easily &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne was able to gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the floor space - or how your property is estimated , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a se@@ di@@ ment@@ ary form a real estate bro@@ ker shall occur and calcul@@ ating a calculation based on the floor size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here they made it to enlarge the floor space and use high @-@ quality materials that make the room its luxurious advantage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the materials are the things that you touch and the therefore help to create an emotional connection in a home &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t love you into the electric sockets in the walls .
these are important , but they &apos;re not playing with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can be seen through good design and increased square footage of something standard in something very aston@@ ishing .
in fact , such as Jo@@ anne , you could decide to leave this not .
brothers fight for a $ 500 million real estate empire
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nast@@ y , in a debate because of one of the largest real estate imper@@ ial Vic@@ tor@@ ias worth over $ 500 million .
the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton Football Club &apos;s and developer Colin De Lut@@ is lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , just three doors of his younger brother Paul . this has led him to the Supreme Court to clari@@ fy how its property and its business might be split .
Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp con@@ front@@ ation over the separation is held in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , brothers loved 38 real estate worth over half a billion dollars , accumulated since the 1973 family purchased a business at Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood .
there , the West@@ co Je@@ ans family founded and grew to a chain of 160 retail outlets .
it was sold to $ 85 million in 1999 .
this money was invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lut@@ is now includes offices in the city centre , the development areas of Brun@@ swi@@ ck and Sorrento , the apartments in gold Coast and Mt . Bul@@ ler as well as shopping m@@ alls in the subur@@ b .
according to an agreement with its de@@ ceased father , Colin - was described by Paul as the main operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the De Lut@@ is family - about two @-@ thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul is about one third .
a parliamentary report states that Colin was property valued at $ 316 million and Paul worth $ 176 million in the amount of $ 176 million .
the distribution of real estate and cash has been proved by Paul as a result .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the establishment of Colin proposed ingredients have left him , which I held for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in 2015 in a first aff@@ id@@ av@@ it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Friday , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place after several inst@@ ig@@ ations of the Supreme Court .
the brothers also fight for control over existing business - including Colin , as Paul claims to be excluded .
Colin argu@@ ed , that &apos;s not true , but raises Paul before , some owners in@@ competent .
in an early aff@@ id@@ av@@ it that was lodged by Colin , he says he hope to settle the dispute .
&quot; my Italian heritage writes that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote .
the cost rise in the case , with hundreds of pages with aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports of businesses , among them Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers , among them Allan My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and of both parties received the law firms .
Ms. De Lut@@ is and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants , which operated dairy bars and delic@@ acy transactions of the late 1950 @-@ s and in the early 1970s an business in Brun@@ swi@@ ck bought .
they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property in which Colin opened the first je@@ ans@@ ary of the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Colin says that he started West German when he was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in my last years , when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anna De Lut@@ is says that she died and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hop@@ ed to share their property for their sons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi said often to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he never wanted that the brothers stood before judgment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lut@@ is Group , whereby Colin claims that Mark was rep@@ aid at the company &apos;s 10 million dollar and Luke 26 million dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark , Paul &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Paul &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the terms of their financial separation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Colin has held very back , although he was a former AF@@ L board member and after a biography in 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire of the best friend of TV stars .
Fair@@ fax Media took in touch with Colin and Paul De Lut@@ on and their dis@@ band@@ ed contact .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only Colin answered by SMS to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really can &apos;t say much , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the case is before the courts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very sad , that my brother Paul has chosen me to acc@@ use me and to withdraw our family name by the courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 , Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he tries to fulfil the demands of his brother .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father had not wanted that Paul and I would say in our current dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he still hope for a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday , this hope seemed to be finished .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our issue will be redeemed in the near future of the dishes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Colin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tr@@ umps of new Chief of Staff plans to restri@@ ct media ab@@ st@@ ence of the president .
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly it can actually do .
if yes , he will be the first .
POL@@ IC@@ ICO reported that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to restri@@ ct the information flow on President Tr@@ ump - including the reports of news coverage in a consistent course .
here is a piece of repor@@ ter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , at his first working day with leading employees , he exhibited a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ umps White House which he would repair : bad information that fall into the hands of the president .
Kelly said the employees that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in mail@@ ings - because the President would make better cho@@ ices if it would receive good information . &quot;
Kell@@ ys Diagn@@ osis makes sense , but others attempts to t@@ ame tr@@ ump by monitor his media control .
President Tr@@ umps is back to television for decades - and now , where he is at the White House , his TV advertising is still strong .
&quot; when Tr@@ ump was cancelled due to un@@ fair coverage , it was productive to show him that he received a fair coverage of places , &quot; said the former election consultant Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February against POL@@ IC@@ ICO .
polit@@ ic@@ os Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote in the time that &quot; the key to keep Tr@@ umps Twitter hab@@ it , according to six former election campaign officials , to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a constant praise prize . &quot;
okay .
but the idea that Tr@@ umps &apos;s Twitter hab@@ it ever &quot; under control &quot; was ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous .
perhaps these campaigns are something that we do not know that Tr@@ umps T@@ we@@ ets had not contained more ignition without their inter@@ ventions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will probably learn something about the we@@ ets that Tr@@ ump has not sent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if his collabor@@ ators make it a few times , trouble learning from him , then their effort was worthwhile .
but no one has consistently been to prevent Tr@@ ump Con@@ vers@@ y .
a part of the problem is that people in a white house develops from competing parties , trying to present their own agenda by bringing Tr@@ ump Material , which may support their belie@@ fs from the world .
POL@@ IC@@ ICO - a whole of this history - reported in May about the pre @-@ love coun@@ sel@@ ing consultants , the president of strategic reasons .
this was an example that by repor@@ ter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher was described :
&quot; current and former Tr@@ ump @-@ officials say that Tr@@ ump can react to negative press cuts , especially such with damaged Lec@@ tures , and that he may get out to find out where these come from .
exactly what happened at the end of February when someone accused of a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet Pro@@ v@@ ok@@ at@@ eurs Charles C. Johnson , who accused the source behind a p@@ ile of his Lec@@ tures &quot; at the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although Johnson was banned from Twitter or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has no concrete evidence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or that he has made false witness in the past and re@@ vo@@ ke them in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump read the article and began to ask employees about Wal@@ sh . &quot;
Gold@@ macher added that the former Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary @-@ General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; tries to implement a system to manage and document the Tr@@ ump &apos; .
how did it work ?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later .
perhaps he will prove himself as an effective manager as pri@@ eb@@ us but Tr@@ ump is still his im@@ pul@@ sive Self , and his advis@@ ors still strug@@ gling for influence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these un@@ changeable factors make mission a very difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mei@@ st@@ requested crimin@@ als receive mail from Europ@@ ol
since the address is unknown , the help of the population is rising and shipped .
the police in all of Europe may be ma@@ iled in this summer ( virtual ) postcards to hazardous crimin@@ als on the run .
since the addresses of selected words are not known natural in nature , information is hop@@ ed from the population and to pray .
Europe &apos;s reported on Friday from the action that follows the &quot; EU Most W@@ anted &quot; Advent calendar from the winter .
the experience had shown that many vol@@ at@@ ile trips are stuck to destination stations , it was called by Europ@@ ol .
one put 21 postcards covering the requested crimin@@ als from 21 EU countries .
since 2016 the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ wanted , more than 2.5 million times has been viewed .
36 of the online games have been arrested so far , at least eleven of them due to the release on the website .
Travel@@ ers negoti@@ ate on a tr@@ ench and return to the &apos; Milli@@ on@@ är@@ s series &apos;
some of the we@@ al@@ thi@@ est house @-@ owner of the West Mid@@ lands are once again negoti@@ ated with some dra@@ fted trips on the war , which have drawn up a field before their houses in front of their houses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the traveler have par@@ ked their 20 car@@ av@@ ans on a field outside a we@@ al@@ thy street of Soli@@ h@@ ull , which is called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Milli@@ on@@ är@@ s @-@ Series &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they brought horses , babies and an army of transport , having only been published in May , without being deported from a bur@@ ial of excav@@ ated tr@@ ench to prevent their accidents .
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in the defense plants and pressed their vehicles by a section called un@@ ob@@ struc@@ tive to find a way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; fur@@ ious residents drew the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull , who said it is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; us@@ eless &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an anonymous population said : &quot; they went there on Monday evening after it was transferred from Bentley Heath , where they have cast a stone on the pass@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Council must be forced by Sch@@ am on the implementation in fact , since it was easy to use with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the traveler were moved in May , moved and are now back again .
more yesterday evening , probably today more . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to move with it for long signatures to protect their parks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I live on the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to pay my common dest@@ iny , if the Council can stop this once . &quot;
a local people who wanted not to be called , said : &quot; it is ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous , we have just seen the last round of this journey , only to be s@@ acked by another round .
the numbers have increased this time and they even saw a horse in the parking area . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokesperson for the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the land beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and are working with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we sei@@ ze the necessary steps to continue as fast as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to support our knowledge collection , it is very important that as many residents sign a anti @-@ social or criminal conduct in the police , then call 101 to call .
this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must test when we submit our case . &quot;
made of bir@@ ch , Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is built from the former site Birken@@ hof .
the building at the gates of Freu@@ den@@ st@@ ad@@ ts is currently being renovated and will be re@@ opened on 1st March next year .
that is good news for the city .
because with the closing of the hotel Birken@@ hof by the former amb@@ ience of the company Birken@@ hof on 13 April 2014 , some 30 000 nights had lost per year and has also been awarded by the tourist tax .
in autumn 2014 , in view of dramatic figures of refugees , which came to the District Court , the hotel building is offered as a collective accommodation , provided for controversi@@ al discussions .
the town prevented the accommodation of asylum seek@@ ers through the development of a development plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disputed at that time .
but above all Freu@@ den@@ bach &apos;s Mayor of Julian Oss@@ wald had def@@ ended the hotel location and spoke of serious interested parties at that time .
he should maintain right .
the group of Lu@@ isen@@ yi with registered office in Bad Berg@@ z@@ om@@ ers has acquired the former Hotel Birken@@ hof with a voluntary auction in Berlin and I want to make it again a home of the three @-@ star plus @-@ category among Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ urban object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ s and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
they are called Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the previous Hotel Birken@@ hof already since longer time , building container stood before the entrance , and when you enter the house , the extensive renovation work will be made .
the floors were torn out , ceilings to the part , old bath@@ tub@@ s from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
there is still much to do in March .
&quot; it actually is a nice place , &quot; Thomas Sch@@ erer says in conversation with our newspaper .
everything is supposed to be renewed in the Black Art Nou@@ veau style .
the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is redesigned , new window will be installed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everything should be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; beautiful right @-@ up &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer is pressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we want to make a jewe@@ l piece ! &quot;
swimming pool , spa area and a meeting room include equipment .
you don &apos;t want to be positioned at the high level of hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ house , but is emphas@@ ized on a higher level of inner city .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its about 60 rooms would establish wide , explains Sch@@ erer further .
both individual guests , groups or business@@ men are supposed to feel at the hotel .
convers@@ ations with O@@ B Julian Oss@@ wald and Tourism director Michael K@@ rau@@ se he already led , so sh@@ erer .
the ideas of the city are covered with those of the Hotel Group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
after the amount of investments , Thomas Sch@@ erer wants to define it exactly .
roughly under one million euros , he calcul@@ ates .
the outside facilities will also be placed on the front , which is already clearly visible .
there is a large terrace , which is publicly accessible from the restaurant that is publicly accessible .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia Aff@@ air : U.S. special exec@@ uting the Grand Jury
in Russia &apos;s aff@@ air to U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump is supposed to have been a so @-@ called Grand Jury named after a report .
the board included in the last few weeks , wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; to appeal to his people .
the paper recorded the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller has expanded its investigations and intensi@@ fied .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the CNN &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; CNN reported that there is the first inspec@@ tions of the Gre@@ mi@@ de in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ umps and a Russian lawyer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
U.S. intelligence accused the Kre@@ m@@ lin since longer , targeted in the presidential campaign in 2016 .
Mu@@ eller studied whether they gave different languages between Tr@@ umps Intern@@ ship team and Moscow .
in the case of investigation , several men are supposed to stand as coun@@ sel@@ ors of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in the election campaign .
according to reports , Mu@@ eller also gained more and more Tr@@ umps private and business environment under the magni@@ fying glass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote some weeks ago that the special inv@@ ig@@ ator Tr@@ ump has personally moved to the center and the for@@ warding , whether the president may have disabled justice as part of the aff@@ air . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main task of Grand jur@@ ies is to examine and decide whether the indictment will be charged .
Grand Jur@@ ys are therefore called the Trial Chamber .
they are switched on , if it is higher and controversi@@ al cases .
the procedure is always closed after sealed doors .
the panel may also be switched on by the Public Prosecutor to invite individuals to the hearing below oath .
according to CNN &apos;s CNN , CNN charges had already been issued to turn around the encounter between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and an Russian lawyer .
individuals who were involved in the meetings were invited to one statement , called it in the report .
Moreover , they should provide documents .
in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. , Tr@@ umps consultants and law @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner and his dam@@ al@@ ant campaign President Paul Man@@ a@@ fort with the discussion .
right @-@ wing experts reported on Thursday evening in US television that Mu@@ eller should not show that Mu@@ eller should not be sh@@ y in his work , and that it should be necessary to negoti@@ ate quickly .
but it must not be inev@@ itable , but the Grand Jury should be switched on at the end to decide on the collection of an indictment .
nevertheless , the decision of the Gre@@ mi@@ um of the start of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason to concern for President Tr@@ ump .
in the middle of the new revel@@ ations , the President on Thursday evening a speech made in West Virginia to present the Russia aff@@ air as a campaign of his political opponents .
&quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; said Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the theme will give the Democrats a way to feel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to feel good because they can &apos;t talk about that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his special advisor T@@ y Cob@@ b declared in a statement that he was ignor@@ ant of a Grand Jury .
but they usually work within walking distance , and he stressed .
the White House advoc@@ ates all measures that the work of the special bro@@ ader was accelerated to the &quot; f@@ aire &quot; way accelerated .
the former FBI CEO James Com@@ ey said three times that I would not be determined against the president .
one has no reason to accept that something has changed , it was stated in the Declaration .
but Mu@@ eller had only been used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had been fired .
because of this rum , accus@@ ations had become in@@ ump , according to Tr@@ ump , he wanted to handic@@ apped justice .
in June , Com@@ ey said before a Senate Committee , Tr@@ ump had asked him for an investigation of the investigation against the then national security adviser to Michael Fl@@ ynn .
the president goes under large pressure because of the investigation .
following the representation of US media , the White House material collected against the special exec@@ uting and its employees .
that dissolved the spec@@ ulations about whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller would have dismissed .
unlike an independent general issu@@ er of Congress as close to the Wat@@ erg@@ ate aff@@ air around the later President Richard Nixon , Mu@@ eller has found a position in which he could be fired on the President of Justice of Justice .
several trans@@ missions of both parties want such a step forward .
two groups of Republi@@ can and democratic trans@@ itions were issued on Thursday legislative powers , after which the special exec@@ uting could not be dismissed .
Ant@@ arc@@ tica : gig@@ antic Eis@@ berg emerg@@ es in Ant@@ arc@@ tica
in the Western Ant@@ arc@@ tic , a gig@@ antic ice@@ berg is solved by the Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is von der Sc@@ el@@ fe@@ is .
this was divided by the Zar@@ ha@@ er Alfred W@@ egener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the above a B@@ illion tons heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometer large colon@@ ies origin@@ ates to the north and will probably be two , three years until it melted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with a length of 175 kilometers and a width of up to 50 kilometres one of the largest iron giant , researchers have registered over the past three decades .
there is no danger for people from him .
to what extent , climate change played a role at the crash of the ice@@ berg , is un@@ clear according to researchers .
however , since around 30 years there is a series of unusual band@@ ings in the region , the U.S. research centre for snow and ice has been writing at the fact that the U.S. research centre for snow and ice has been writing .
according to many researchers , this can inter@@ act with global warming .
the un@@ broken col@@ oss was so far a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is so far .
s@@ el@@ fe@@ is floating on the sea and is fed by large gl@@ ac@@ iers .
consequently , it grows on the sea and there is a regular basis .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is located south of South America almost at the top of the ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula .
North of this Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ ises was the equilibrium of wax and break down some years ago .
a complete Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is was torn there , writes A@@ WI researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen .
there &apos;s something to say that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is in danger , because the front edge is never gone back as far as at present .
in addition , the ice @-@ sla@@ b under stress and could be broken down , if in a key place will break a piece .
the melt of Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is and Eis@@ berg increases the sea level , because they swim in the water as much water den@@ ial , as it emerg@@ es after the melt .
however , the loss of the el@@ fe@@ at causes the gl@@ ac@@ iers directly to the sea and can flow much faster than before .
this could possibly increase sea level , but only in a low degree , the British research project for observation of the Ant@@ arc@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) .
according to A@@ WI , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is the Ant@@ arc@@ tica country with almost 50 000 square kilometres .
the crossing from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean approximately 200 meters .
there it breaks regularly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although there is a natural sor@@ rows and not aware of the change to climate change , the ice sign is now available in a dangerous position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ Le@@ ary from the British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is the most far re@@ treat since the beginning of the Records , &quot; he confirmed it .
under scientists may be controversi@@ al if the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is now again grow again or in the long term , his colleague Adrian Luck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will last decades .
even though this researchers have not re@@ lied to climate change in the crash of this gig@@ antic ink , so many ice@@ bergs of the ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula are broken down in the past decades .
this long line of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic goes to South America .
according to data of the British Ant@@ arc@@ tic Survey , the ice surface of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula has dropped by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s .
I contributed to decline in temperature increase .
the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula have passed over the past 50 years around three degrees , so that the temperature at the fastest speed in which the temperature is absolute .
CD@@ U wants pet price during personnel
because it is always difficult to occup@@ y free spots , the CD@@ U demands to acc@@ ede from the employer to becoming more attractive .
finally before the summer break , the Kre@@ ist@@ ag has won 41 new jobs in administration .
more than 1,@@ 100 employees and officials work for the county management in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now , 17 trainees have their first working day behind him .
the apprenti@@ ce at the circle are obviously very desired .
some 620 applicants were to be recorded for the number of places in this year .
nevertheless , the circle continues to meet staff to meet the targeted requirements and tasks .
at the moment we have not occupied M@@ ett@@ mann in circle M@@ ett@@ mann as before 50 .
among others , doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration are sought .
the CD@@ U wants to take the initiative in the Kre@@ ist@@ ag together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG from the initiative and to compete with the trade sp@@ ill statement in the management .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the administration should work in accordance with the desire of the parties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for personnel recovery and personnel development &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is to cover not only short @-@ term regre@@ t to the field , but looking forward to re @-@ orient@@ ated the candidate .
the overall concept should focus on inside and outside , concrete measures for trans@@ verse boots and include a training initiative , require CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
this has been listening to a good approach .
because the circle has to do with staff problems , which is not known in the past .
other towns advertise good officials and employees offer more attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is of a real &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition of public employers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this purpose , a high number of employees , the disease or age @-@ conditi@@ onally , comes from the service .
so the highest time to move , so that no more places remain un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter peoples , leader of the CD@@ U , continues to go beyond the common request with his party .
he had long had long things already in the Kre@@ ist@@ ag for a fine @-@ up surprise , when he asked the identity for public , and the other parties flour@@ ished .
&quot; &quot; &quot; peoples &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people want to check all the possibilities to make an exit of the municipal work association &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we are not in the short term to a satisfactory solution , the county management should also include trade unions , perhaps also in cooperation with the urban towns - a pet tariff , &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this makes the CD@@ U , the employees and civil servants have tried to pay better than the tariff for Public Service .
the sal@@ aries are currently exactly prescribed , increases or more money if one changes in a higher level which is oriented to vocational @-@ years .
but the tasks of the circle are increasingly grown in recent years .
only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be established , in which employees take care of the provisions of the new pro@@ stit@@ ching protection law .
not least by increasing the number of asylum seek@@ ers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and county director Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy tigh@@ tened the tone to NGO Mig@@ rants rescue li@@ fe@@ at
in Italy , Italy added the rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean Sea , warned that they are not able to continue if they do not keep new rules for their operations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if NGOs do not have a new Code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Interior Minister Marco Min@@ nit@@ i in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Min@@ nit@@ is warning came a day after the Italian authorities had contrac@@ ted a boat from the German charity organization &apos; youth Ret@@ tet &apos; in a way because their team worked effectively with human traff@@ ic@@ kers in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration .
the charity organization which has been in operation only since one year , refused to express itself in exec@@ uting the Amb@@ ro@@ gio Cart@@ o@@ o Italian government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us , the salvation of human life remains our top priority . so we &apos;re sorry that we could not operate in the search and rescue zone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organization in a statement on social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can judge all the alleg@@ ations that can be collected , after we have collected all the information and judge the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had the boat from &apos; youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , supervised by I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , since October .
it is thought that his crew famili@@ y ships will be delivered directly from human traff@@ ic@@ kers , and that the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers can drive away so that the ships can be used again .
at least one such meeting re@@ union took place only 1.3 miles before the Libyan coast , according to the acquisition of the State Court , whose content was published by Italian media .
the occupation will be suspected of implementing the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , the rescue operations in the zone of humanitarian grounds and not from any other moti@@ ves .
under the code of conduct , boats such as the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a must provide an Italian police officers to board their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far been declared to keep the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be regarded as unnecessary , but they would not cause &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; essential changes or disabilities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their lif@@ ec@@ ess@@ work . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among those who sign to sign a Nobel Prize @-@ winner organization Doc@@ tors Without Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
Min@@ nit@@ i said today that the number of migrants who came to Italy after the rescue measures in Italy came back in recent weeks that the efforts to strengthen Libya &apos;s coastal waters and cooperation with local civil clusters have borne fruits .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he announced plans for more discussions with Libyan citizens in this month through economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali about measures to reduce the number of migrants who deser@@ ted those countries in hope of Europe .

console instead of lawn - Bundesliga match for e @-@ sport
sit Sport @-@ Stars in future before computer consoles , instead of strug@@ gling with wind and weather over the St@@ adi@@ on@@ f ?
fact : E @-@ sport has long since become a serious sector , become a serious business - large stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high g@@ ages .
this also known the first federal election , which are increasingly eng@@ age in this area .
at the beginning of 2015 , the V@@ f@@ l Wolfsburg , later followed the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @-@ sport in mid @-@ July and took part two professionals for the Computer Game FIFA 17 .
&quot; we hope to insp@@ ire all new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says the board of Jochen R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is sure that there are still some clubs on this train . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
next weekend , the FIFA World Federation - FIFA World Cup , organized the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup &quot; in London to compete against the Gam@@ er of various clubs .
for example , in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfsburg , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or PS@@ V Eindhoven are qualified .
Robin D@@ utt looks great potential in e @-@ sport .
in the meantime , the Ex @-@ Trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen has meanwhile been an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real football needs to deal with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds that the young people will continue to go into the stadium , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and in the clubs , all possible markets tried to conquer the Asian region .
with prominent E @-@ sport@@ s@@ men , online @-@ sport@@ s@@ men can be extended online by far more often in these markets , when only once again in the year the Federal lig@@ aments industry is sent to Asia .
what is it exactly ?
during the E @-@ sport , computer games such as &quot; League Of Legends &quot; , &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or to put the Soccer Simulation FIFA on competitive level .
as long as in the normal sport , Li@@ gen is established , where professionals join each other .
and during the Asia @-@ play , E @-@ Sport is already part of the official program .
but is it about a real sport ?
for many is the introduction safe and needy .
also Ingo F@@ rob@@ otic has also been dealt with the question .
for the Professor at the German Sports University in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport because it is competent and many organic and physical reactions show you can also find in classical sport , for example , increased heart frequency channels , stress relief reactions , hormon@@ al changes .
and it also need cogn@@ itive skills , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a fast response .
professional gam@@ ers should not only exercise on the console but also to exercise their body and keep your diet .
&quot; the f@@ itte player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ rob@@ otic sees problems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ oping is always a topic &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls are heavy @-@ fe@@ as@@ ible with online games , and in the scene was missing the structures of classic sports .
the scientist emphas@@ ises the high integr@@ ative effect of the E @-@ Sports .
players are internationally active , that &apos;s like a large global family , there are no intercultural shirts .
a study by the consulting firm Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) says the E @-@ Sport a fast growth ahead .
in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly on advertising , sponsor@@ ship and large tournaments .
in three years sales revenues amounted to 130 million .
around 2.4 billion euros of the soccer Bundesliga , which is little .
however , the E @-@ Sport &quot; is not far away from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey , &quot; write the Del@@ o@@ itte consultant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; International are many countries already further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
large markets are Asia and the USA where ex @-@ basketball player Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ guez takes part in the US Team N@@ RG e@@ Sports .

there is a lot in Europe .
in a Norwegian school , E @-@ Sport has been introduced as a class@@ room , F@@ rob@@ otic says .
in the Netherlands and France , the soccer league clubs are obliged , according to D@@ utt , has been obliged to set up a E @-@ Sport department .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European comparison , Germany &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says V@@ f@@ B @-@ Management R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only in nost@@ algia to fall , and the old times should clari@@ fy , it is not enough anymore .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s way to keep the tradition of the association , but the company also set up the modern market at the same time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we live in a digit@@ alised world , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says D@@ utt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is none to hold fast that , only in football , everything remains always . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Michelle Carter condem@@ ns the texts that Conrad joined the suicide in 1931
in Massachusetts , a woman of Massachusetts was condemned to two and a half years , because she encour@@ ages her boy@@ friend and calls to suicide .
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her condem@@ nation behind G@@ ame@@ works and five years were suspended on prob@@ ation .
Carter was condemned in June for neg@@ ligent hom@@ icide of Conrad Roy who took life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My Family is unbe@@ atable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to stay free until appeal .
it was con@@ fron@@ ted with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but their legal representatives were argu@@ ed that both she had suffered from psychological illness .
in red tro@@ users and a cream color bl@@ ouse , Carter stood there with tears in eyes , folded hands and down eyes , when they were condemned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their actions have died Conrad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the State Judge in the Court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she finished his life to make her own better . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she has not taken responsibility , &quot; she said .
&quot; she did not show a re@@ mor@@ se . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ man &apos;s lawyer said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful circum@@ stance that they completely regre@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz , however , he did not found that her &quot; age or ri@@ pen@@ ess or even her mind disease have a significant effect on their actions . &quot;
a state attor@@ ney read a statement by Ro@@ ys Mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said it &quot; no day if I didn &apos;t take the loss of my beloved Son .
I would like that he is proud of me and how I am going to go with everything . I try , in spite of all my pain which we will bear for etern@@ ity with us , &quot; says it in it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ ys sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy said that they would never be persecuted in the knowledge &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that they never take part in the wedding of their brother or a a@@ unt for his children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no more than this one to have been together with whom I was working every day since my birth it is a pain that I will always keep with my life for my life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ence because there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime to commit any other committed suicide .
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide in@@ tox@@ ication in one vehicle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the case moved national attention to himself after Car@@ ters probably revealed that she encouraged him to end his life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hands on , spring of a building , burst yourself , I don &apos;t know , there are many ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said in several messages which she had sent in the two weeks before his death , while he was with his family on vacation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the eyes of his suicide in front of his suicide , she wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must do it , Conrad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You must do the generator , and you will be free and happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz told that Carter sought attention by the death of Roy , ordered that they should take advantage of any press from the case .
the case has the legal opinion .
to the few , the Carter belonged to Am@@ anda Knox , who was convicted in 2007 due to murder by their British worker in Italy , before she was acquitted two years ago .
Mrs. Knox , 30 years old , published a comment in Los Angeles Times : &quot; Michelle Carter deser@@ ves compassion and help , not in prison . &quot;
Joshua K@@ imm@@ i : learn from the new mini @-@ l@@ ame of FC Bavaria
that Joshua K@@ imm@@ i was allowed to run the Audi Cup as captain , no co@@ incidence .
the FC Bayern mix@@ es a great season with the Con@@ stant Cup winner as a great season - with extra motivation .
anything else was there differently on his place in the cabin , I looked at Joshua K@@ imm@@ i immediately , even if the additional clothes was very small .
but as far as far and wide on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups , no one was Philipp Lah@@ m and also had no Manuel New to see , he made himself the divided ties to the arm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trainer didn &apos;t have announced it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Con@@ stant Cup winner will be back after his first use as a Bayern @-@ Captain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
well , the one could have better run better than 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but the character of the coach could also be so de@@ pri@@ zed .
not the eight years older Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al was chosen as a player who has been chosen from youth , de@@ but@@ ant and just from the holiday , he has chosen the C @-@ El@@ f as a game leader .
sugar is spread to those who want to as@@ sign a lot to those who want to keep with La@@ une .
so if anyone has chosen , an heritage of Lah@@ m can only be used only well to use a small extra motivation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ imm@@ ich confirmed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what you want to do as a player : responsibility &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old turns over the field as mini @-@ l@@ ame .
right behind , this is now its position , the white Bin@@ d at the arm opened its rest .
and at all , K@@ imm@@ i worked as a one who can take the ru@@ d@@ der still best in hand .
he gave orders to direct the blo@@ cked tro@@ upe .
he had the Eye for all , while many others were busy with themselves .
Vid@@ al there@@ with his missing fitness to play ( open@@ ely hard ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches get caught on the services of the Asia @-@ trip ( folded only conditi@@ onally ) ; and Sebastian Rud@@ y and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sweet with that , in their first appearance in the Bayern tri@@ cot were not neg@@ lec@@ ted .
this was done quite good .
in addition to K@@ imm@@ ich , Rud@@ y before the def@@ ences , both ag@@ ated sou@@ ther@@ ly .
the nam@@ ach@@ erous Napol@@ i storm frequently did bad@@ ly , moreover , Sü@@ ver sought out a few times in the game building .
his colleague Rud@@ y said that the result was not so how we hop@@ ed for us . &quot;
but he also showed an ordinary performance at the debut .
game storage , speed change : &quot; for this style I was brought again . &quot;
how in this Bayern world is still for the new length , you looked at the game to the game .
for instance , Rud@@ y had not given a one or two , but surely six or seven interviews .
K@@ imm@@ i passed the back of his new players after a few cr@@ un@@ chy .
there he heard an interesting proposition from Sü@@ le : &quot; what &apos;s going to here , I noticed now .
with Bavaria you have to win any game . &quot;
after all this he must not teach the new .

company satisfied with Rhineland @-@ p@@ fäl@@ ischer Minister : Wirtschaft im W@@ iss@@ ings Tempo
it was often un@@ reconc@@ iling , the relation between the country and regional economy as Ev@@ eline Lem@@ ke ( green ) still Minister of Economic Affairs of Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate .
this is , after more than one year , in which the new Minister Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region do not speak to T V @-@ request of a change in economic policy - and t@@ les at the same time the old minist@@ ries .
Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ erer Companies ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; Know the wishes of the economy that Lem@@ ke has block@@ aded . &quot;
the biggest K@@ ehr@@ t@@ wende looks at Nat@@ us in the infrastructure policy : the connection of the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au stood up in the ranking list of the country .
the ministry is hop@@ ing for planning in this year , and the building law is expected to rise until 2021 .
a role in the plans of the country also plays the western orbit of Trier , which is located in the event of breach of the Federal Financial Market .
the aim is to take the route in December 2020 into operation , says Minister @-@ speaking Cornelia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
Nat@@ us sees a sign to support regional , but un@@ ri@@ vals companies .
the Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( I@@ HK ) are engaged in Trier , as a Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate label , to increase sales volumes in supermarkets and halt the trend of the German exports since ten years .
Moreover , Wis@@ sing an open ear for people who want to establish a dedicated company , the Chamber of Commerce .
the Chamber of Cra@@ fts Trier is in the new Master Bonus added an additional inc@@ enti@@ ve for young apprentices , says Managing Director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach .
the premium income of 1000 Euros is planned for the master review and 2500 Euros if graduates are self @-@ employed within ten years after master@@ ing training .
hom@@ e@@ work @-@ list for the country remains long .
the planned roads were to create quickly facts , at the same time it is the country &apos;s necessary staff , says Jan Glock@@ auer , chief executive director of the Chamber of Commerce Trier .
of 56 new engineers , the Wis@@ sing at Landes@@ anstalt wants to access mobility , so far only 29 places occupied .
the I@@ HK requires more jobs to be awarded to external offices .
CD@@ U Fra@@ ction vi@@ ze Christian Bald@@ auf refers to calculations of the Court of Audit@@ ors , the country invested more than 20 million euros less in the preservation of state roads in 2017 and 2018 .
Frank Nat@@ us also expects a concept of the country , as it wants to resol@@ ve the trade sp@@ icious angel in the region .
he remains the former broad@@ band assembly in the country .
in 2016 , regional companies had been rated power supply in an I@@ HK survey only with a score of 3.4 .
they compl@@ ained about stock@@ holders and break@@ through@@ s .
at the moment , ex @-@ Economic Minister Ev@@ eline Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and is still sitting on the supervisory board of the wind turbine Pro Wind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Gre@@ ens group left Lem@@ ke to the end of April to become President of a private university in Karlsruhe , where they had already returned to the field after four months &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Audi is supposed to change 85@@ 0,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers con@@ fron@@ ted with a return reaction
one day before the announcement of Audi said BMW , that it would offer to upgrade the software to more than 35@@ 0,000 vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the BMW &apos;s chair said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the opinion that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is more intelligent options as driving restrictions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and thus moved to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is located - diesel vehicles to provide or restri@@ ct diesel engines . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday , that there will be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the business as a recall .
European autom@@ akers have strongly funded the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
but nitrogen oxi@@ des , em@@ it the diesel engines , are considered as car@@ cin@@ ogenic and may cause as@@ thma .
the cost of autom@@ akers , autom@@ ating the neutr@@ alisation of diesel vehicles to re@@ install diesel vehicles , also take advantage of that it makes difficult to hold the price of cars competitive .
the German Chancellor Angela Merkel will also be charged to ign@@ ore the most powerful car companies and the signs of the problem .
the companies attemp@@ ting to avoid the bug of Volkswagen to regul@@ ate the use of so @-@ called shut@@ ters , emissions regul@@ ating the regulations , when a car has been tested , but in normal driving conditions .
several members of Volkswagen were indicted in the United States , others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , former head of ther@@ mod@@ y@@ nam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .
the former manager , Zac@@ ch@@ eo Giovanni Pam@@ io , is Italian and is therefore not covered before delivery and could be judged in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was included in German criminal investig@@ ations@@ in Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi to b@@ yp@@ assing the emission regulations in Europe , and a request which focused on the United States .
the inclusion of Audi in the study could be heavily loaded in Volkswagen : the luxury automotive supplier carries over propor@@ tion@@ ately to the profit of Volkswagen .

Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll@@ ern and laugh@@ ing Against the Ban@@ ks
Mor@@ dil@@ lo was one of the most widely published cartoon character , the buttons of his figur@@ ines are his trademark .
the Argentine is also character@@ ised with a total of 85 stories and works in a film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his message : laughter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for there is much suffering in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ dil@@ lo was born on 4 August 1932 as son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first few years as an artist he struck himself as a dra@@ fts@@ man for fortune cards - what was fru@@ str@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most happy day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said once . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after stations in Lima , New York and Paris , late &apos; 60s breakthrough : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match , &quot; and then in the &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazines around the world .
Mor@@ dil@@ lo has many fans in China .
again , the artists were inspired by cities .
large , all @-@ round Mor@@ dil@@ lo figures bol@@ ted in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning he sits according to his own information today , still at the drawing , every day is nearly ten hours .
over cal@@ end@@ ars , puzzles , books for Gross and Klein , T @-@ Shirts , Pl@@ ush favorites and watches , his dro@@ l@@ able figures continues to spread much spread worldwide .
for six years he has been working on a cartoon film and a TV series with his figures .
the main person in the film &quot; Crazy Island &quot; is a Giraffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los popular animal in his drawings , which has an exchange of thous@@ and@@ ed feet as counter @-@ player .
for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D movie , which will be shown on the Kin@@ ol@@ enter wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what they will say , it is strange to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mor@@ dil@@ lo . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the script is not written by him .
therefore , it &apos;s more on the TV series that will be produced as his original drawings , which is t@@ less produced .
Lav@@ ender @-@ Provence is threatened with climate change
he became a symbol of Provence in southern France , but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change .
the lav@@ ender is due to the d@@ rought of d@@ rought in terms of d@@ rought , and due to the disease transmitted insec@@ ts , scientists and farmers , which are attemp@@ ting to find solutions , great head@@ aches .
Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of agricultural research institutes CR@@ I@@ EP@@ P@@ AM in Provence , said : &quot; the Lav@@ en@@ del in Provence is effective because the plant had been exposed to climate change in the last years , who in the spring much less rain , and in the autumn much more .
this has impact on the life of lav@@ ender .
there is also a small Z@@ ik@@ ade , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium , which transm@@ its the d@@ warf @-@ hand , and with very dry weather there are very many of them . &quot;

the city of Ge@@ isa in th@@ ür@@ ing@@ ian R@@ ho@@ n celebrates its 1,200 @-@ year anniversary .

the assassination of an journalist emphas@@ izes the growing threat in Mexico
the employee of the weekly Ri@@ odo@@ ce meet normally on Wed@@ nesdays , in order to check their plans for the most recent chaos in Sin@@ al@@ oa by the organized crime , corrupt civil servants and un@@ ce@@ asing drugs .
but on that day , in the shade of their own tragedy , they came together to speak about security .
it was revealed to them that it &apos;s important to change their rout@@ ines .
two high @-@ level journalists will discuss what more saf@@ er : they are supposed to take their children with the office , which were the objective of an attack with granite , or them at home in 2009 .
security experts have written three words to a panel on the front of the room : opponent , Neutr@@ ality , ally .
they ask for repor@@ ter , to propose name for each column - no evidence is necessary , perc@@ eptions , and ab@@ dom@@ inal pain .
there are drug traff@@ ics , politicians , business@@ men , journalists , who are suspected of being suspected of for@@ ci@@ ble from the government or the cart@@ els , a catalogue of crimin@@ als which make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there are no ru@@ he@@ pause of violence , and throughout the country the dead he@@ aps , are increasingly more journalists : at least 25 , since then President En@@ rique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto according to attacks and thre@@ ats under federal law and until now there were at least seven dead in seven countries this year .
under the latter , their editor and its inspiration from Ri@@ odo@@ ce , the co @-@ founder Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
its lack is deeply received , although its presence is available everywhere - a large photo of Val@@ dez , which show@@ cases his medium @-@ finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; wearing T @-@ shirts , which show his sm@@ iling face with glasses or his typical Panam@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop will take place less than two months after his death , and the repor@@ ter discuss their shared subjects , trau@@ ma , their night@@ mar@@ es , ins@@ om@@ nia , Par@@ ano@@ ia .
although in 2010 , a special Office of the Office was built to process the cases of journalists , in accordance with the Committee to protect the protection of journalists , only two criminal proceedings .
as in most thousands of murder , which are linked to drug traff@@ icking , which every year are linked with drugs , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are only rarely before judgment .
at Ri@@ odo@@ ce they are still able to handle the violence of Sin@@ al@@ oa , although they are in@@ tr@@ inal and even though the terrain is still sl@@ ated .
without information about the mur@@ derer , without righteousness , the meeting about the discussion of security , says I@@ barra .
&quot; it is very stup@@ id , to turn my time in this workshop , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t know the reason why we know all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the morning of 15 May Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he only managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was removed from two men before his car was forced out and 12 times , presumably because of the name of the newspaper - who is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 12th river . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Sag@@ itt@@ arius in his car went away and damaged in the vicinity .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ors to fly in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an freely around .
but by Val@@ dez there is virtually nothing as silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest in January and the extradition of the United States in January , Sin@@ al@@ oa became one of the country &apos;s most bloo@@ dies@@ t slaugh@@ ter@@ fields , as the rival fac@@ tions fight to fill the vacuum .
it does nothing that in Sin@@ al@@ oa would be shot every day someone or several people on the street or that the gra@@ vey@@ ard is full of emb@@ ell@@ ished , two @-@ story clicks for drug ch@@ efs who are bigger than many houses to live .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a minute that there is a state of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; peace &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; if only one box has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trade routes into the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of its work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , with the debt that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ understanding contributed to the murder .
first published in February the publication of a interviews with Dam@@ o L@@ op@@ ez , a leader of the rival cardboard fra@@ ctions held in war with Gu@@ z@@ mans &apos;s sons .
this release likes to be off@@ ended by the sons , a gear @-@ members purchased each copy of the edition as soon as she was delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks .
the second mistake had not for@@ cing Val@@ dez , not for@@ cing , after the sei@@ zing of another newspaper who had published the same story , to leave the country to his own safety .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and its killing is considered a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists .
he had so long survived that his friends and colleagues so that he would always be there .
he was active in 2003 as an experienced repor@@ ter for Nor@@ o@@ este when he joined the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars involved with five colleagues .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ al@@ oa , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism , without exer@@ ting journ@@ alism , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the time , the newspaper had a reputation because of the cour@@ ageous and hon@@ est reporting , and sales and advertising took part .
repor@@ ters lovers it to publish serious investigation without fear in front of c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship , and the reader was fascin@@ ated by a publication that they could read stories , which nobody else was to treat .
she was awarded the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Award for eight years after the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ ce to the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Award . &quot;
in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee on the Protection of Journ@@ alists for his courage at the persecution of the Mexican drug history , where also led them .
he gave up voluntarily to that he was afraid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to continue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ Y award . &quot; &quot; &quot;
drug traff@@ icking in Sin@@ al@@ oa &quot; is a way of life , &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento TV .
&quot; you need to take the task that falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what have you done ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why did you not tell what happened before ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ odo@@ ce Team measures Val@@ dez , the fun vo@@ gel that could flu@@ ffy , the friend who was gener@@ ously with h@@ ugs and coun@@ sel@@ ors , a teacher who knew how to survive .
she confi@@ ded on his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
he would always go to El Bay@@ abo , the bar opposite the office , go there and always sitting on the same table .
now ask her : was his love for routine his cal@@ am@@ ity ?
his death also has forced them to ask their own particip@@ ations in question as they can do their work on the best and live thereby .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t like to deal with their wives , their children , their children , their own c@@ utt@@ ings and run@@ ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result is , even in the best times , a high level of self @-@ cen@@ sored and self @-@ ster@@ ilization .
trust his own inst@@ inc@@ ts .
if it is wrong , lead away from it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the trouble is , the editor of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce And@@ res Vill@@ ar@@ real , said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; od@@ our a sense that can be deceived ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then the thing with Javier happens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old rules , such as he and others , are not valid in Sin@@ al@@ oa , the same as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other countries , in which a po@@ ison@@ ous mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative dirt gro@@ oves , weak institutions and corrupt government officials at home .
the landscape changes steadily .
in the room where the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce met for security training , suddenly no mobile phones are allowed . days previously announced that Spyware , who is sold exclusively to governments , was used for monitoring journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside , two polic@@ emen sought protection against the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .
they were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ story building in a middle class of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
half in the sh@@ ear , some of the repor@@ ters survey@@ ed whether these officers belong to the 50 per cent of polic@@ emen , who said Governor himself as not tru@@ st@@ worthy .
it &apos;s months ago since the repor@@ ter went into the mountain area where the drug no@@ de fac@@ to stand under control .
for the issue of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ ce has divided three main stories for the issue of this week .
there was the assassination of the brother of the former familiar Box@@ er Juli@@ o Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ al@@ oa .
they also had a pos@@ thum@@ é to the public spending , concentrated on the hom@@ etown of the govern@@ ors .
and there was a group made in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a souven@@ ir sheet from the public prosecutor &apos;s office , a kidn@@ apping .
there was no official word that was ab@@ duc@@ ted or as it happened , so it was careful when it was time to write that every man in the city knows that the restaurant is a favorite locally of drug traff@@ ic@@ kers and authorities .
a repor@@ ter learned from public records that the restaurant has been registered under the name of a polit@@ ician , who ruled the ra@@ dic@@ tive Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( pr@@ i ) , who ruled the whole century all the political levels .
recently , multiple pr@@ i govern@@ ors were charged by corruption .
in Vill@@ ar@@ real bat the repor@@ ter , more previous inci@@ dents in this loc@@ ale , among them one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; was cancelled under a military attack .
just a few months earlier , readers of Val@@ dez had previously been considered the best informed source about kidn@@ apping .
&quot; previously , we knew what happened , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nickn@@ ame &quot; El FLACO &quot; because of its sl@@ ender body nature .
&quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
the office of Val@@ dez was dedicated to storage space for characters and st@@ ic@@ kers , dedicated to the mur@@ ders of journalists , because the employees have never been something expected , since they had never expected : activ@@ ist in the name of the press .
repor@@ tedly Mi@@ riam R@@ ami@@ rez made a few signs and went on the next morning to a demonstration because of a further journalists in the office of the Prosecutor .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed , in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body was discovered and civil servants say , based on DNA tests that it is his .
journalists had become a loud noise in the whole country by writing to the protests &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; on the basis and buil@@ ders .
the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez in Washington is the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez in Washington and try to collect international support for justice in the case of Val@@ dez .
at a meeting with the Governor of Sin@@ al@@ oa on the day after the assassination of Val@@ dez , R@@ ami@@ rez accused the authorities to con@@ struct journalists and destroy them , because they have said the truth .
she has since then asked to be divided by the government since she is concerned , because she is concerned that their rage has viol@@ ated their objec@@ tivity .
Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico had been en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed in Mexico of organised crimes , involved in government officials and a uniform society . &quot;
in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that repor@@ ter will not only be killed by drug traff@@ icking , but also on the order of politicians and security forces , who put the organised crime under a blan@@ ket .
last year , the media group &quot; Arti@@ cul@@ o 19 &quot; has assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of police and civil servants last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you die , because they would like to hold the mouth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ ami@@ rez said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously the mur@@ ders have a deter@@ rent effect .
no man forget the death of the blo@@ g@@ ger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , six years ago .
your body was found together with a note that allegedly signed by the Z@@ etas @-@ Cart@@ el : &quot; here I am for my reports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a computer keyboard and headphones beside the separate head .
some branches have chosen to close as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern state of Ch@@ ihu@@ ah@@ ua following the assassination of correspondence Mi@@ ro@@ sl@@ ava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue , as it was El Man@@ ana from Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo after the assassination of its Directors in 2004 .
in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly prepared on the drug Cart@@ el with an editorial map on the title page of the title &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists fled from their native countries , or even from the country .
it &apos;s a pain@@ ful decision .
it is hard to find work in exile , and they are still looking for dangers and seek haz@@ ards .
and sometimes they are j@@ ump@@ ed , as it is revealed by the photographer Reuben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City was murdered three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who continue back and continue the work , it is a daily dance with risk @-@ cat@@ ches .
I@@ barra , who wanted to be a poet , gives to him that the drug traff@@ icking is troubled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mexico goes to hell , and so I was repor@@ ter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already terminated , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce sat on the office in front of the office and drank beer , when all their phones began to Sum@@ men .
a series of shooting with band riv@@ ets and security forces near the Maz@@ at@@ lan &apos;s bathing forces had left 19 dead .
the war continues , as promised by a series of cart@@ el messages in the region .
from the on @-@ board edge we published the news on the site of Ri@@ odo@@ ce on mobile phone .
the page had to be changed on the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens hot in the vicinity - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez designed a look at the polic@@ emen who stopped the watch to see if they were in read@@ iness .
if they had not fear at all , they did not show it .
under the mighty portrait of the newspaper , whose middle @-@ finger was visible for the Sin@@ al@@ oa , the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed his mark .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you think , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the same day was murdered at Javier , the practitioners was murdered in me to send them to the street &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ ouflage to sof@@ ten his enemies .
the first glance looks like a statue , when a sc@@ ary sc@@ ary .
now , researchers found that the first findings of the unbelievable rhin@@ o@@ cer@@ os of a Canadian mining was so well received that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of Din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was so good that they could even determine that his demanding skin was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rub@@ b@@ ish Braun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she would have had something of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ quiet past &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Current Biology &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; described him as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; preserved wooden osau@@ rs &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which was ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs specimens of the world &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fossil species is a newly discovered style of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier who lived in the middle of the chal@@ k life between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
his incredibly well preserv@@ ated state , researchers , who describe it as &quot; really remarkable &quot; was amazing
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ge@@ pan@@ de@@ fied her@@ ni@@ vo@@ res is the best preserved fossil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Radio , when he was on March 21 , 2011 in the Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alberta , Canada .
he hit anything out of the surrounding rock in the plat@@ ter , and decided to look more precisely .
F@@ ossil was sent by him in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pale@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to un@@ cover the wild beast within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) heavy globe .
after all this hard work , the finished result is ready to be unveiled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you lose just a little with the eyes , you could almost believe that it slept &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the main aut@@ or Cal@@ eb Brown , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum , where the creature is visible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it will go to science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs individuals - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
researchers have found that this her@@ ni@@ v@@ ore is covered , although it is covered with a arm@@ or , probably resem@@ bles the meat @-@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs .
the strong din@@ osau@@ rs Din@@ osau@@ rs used a red and white cam@@ ouflage to hide himself before smoke , and used a sh@@ iel@@ ding technology that is known as counter@@ act , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have allowed to mix better in its surroundings and to sof@@ ten his enemies , experts say what it suggests that it was threatened by greater din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million years old creation from the family of the No@@ dos@@ sier was made head@@ lines for the first time in May and is now in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
in the researchers , researchers have studied the wild animal , and it is Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the Muse@@ um@@ st@@ echni@@ ker Mark Mitchell , one of a team that has spent more than 7.000 hours in order to cover it carefully .
the amazing conservation of the specimen enabled it possible to document Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the patterns and the form of sheds and arm@@ or about his body .
they discovered the sh@@ aded , a common defence method in the animal kingdom , which means that the tip of the creature was dar@@ ker than their under@@ side .
although the con@@ sh@@ aded is common , the results are surprising because the size of Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta far exceeds that of the today living creatures .
it indicates that the din@@ osau@@ rs revealed sufficient pressure through meat @-@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs that the evolution of the con@@ front@@ ation of the con@@ front@@ ation was favorable .
but most contemporary animals , who are deplo@@ ying con@@ sh@@ ady or use , are much smaller and in@@ viol@@ ently than spo@@ ils that this No@@ dos@@ sier was exposed to a real struggle for survival .
&quot; great pre@@ dat@@ or behavior on a massive , strong ge@@ ared din@@ osau@@ rs have to show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs ben@@ ds have to have been , &quot; said Brown .
chemical analysis of organic compounds in its scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ rs was brown .
scientists do continue investig@@ ating the animal to notice about his life , including its ser@@ um dar@@ ling , to figure out what it has eaten its last meal .
and they believe that Din@@ osau@@ rs , when he died , was cast into a river and was cast into the sea , where he sank to the sea .
at that time , Alberta has been as warm as south fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably more widespread than they are today .
&quot; this cam@@ dos@@ sier is really remarkable because it is covered fully with preserved skin , but also maintained in three dimensions and keeps the original form of the animal hus@@ band@@ ed , &quot; said Brown .
&quot; the result is that the animal looks almost exactly as in the early delivery time .
you don &apos;t need to use of fantasy to recon@@ struct it . if you &apos;re only a little with the eyes , you could almost believe that he is at bed@@ time . &quot;
the chal@@ k time was a time , as huge ther@@ mometer , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , which were standing on two legs , the earth passed through .
although the king of them , the Ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Rex lived , lived millions years after Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the covered din@@ osau@@ rs was ge@@ ared by some of his fur@@ ious ancestors .
it includes the Acro@@ can@@ al@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 feet ( 11,5 m ) long , six tons heavy monster .
the scientist , whose latest findings in the journal New Biology appear , believe that Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta has been sank after the death in the sea and lu@@ ded in lu@@ dge .
the creation was found by Sha@@ wn Radio , when he was on March 21 , 2011 in the Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alberta , Canada .
according to the museum , it is the preserved wooden din@@ osau@@ rs of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the th@@ igh .
the creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and have weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long shar@@ pen@@ ing , accompanied by his shoul@@ ders .
the researchers believe that the covered plant @-@ car@@ ni@@ vo@@ res have been w@@ asted through the Western Canada until a floo@@ ded river to the open sea .
but the water@@ bur@@ ial of the din@@ osau@@ rs keep his arm@@ our in exquisite detail .
the vest@@ ed resi@@ due of this special specimen are so good that the skin will still cover the high @-@ pri@@ ge plates along the din@@ osau@@ rs
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Michael Gre@@ sh@@ ko written for National Ge@@ ographic , this is such a level of preser@@ ving as &apos; rare as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lot@@ tery &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the more I see it , the better contra@@ dic@@ ated .
remaining remains of the skin still cover the high @-@ pri@@ cel@@ et plates that bear the skull of the animal .
his right foot is on his side , his five fingers are moved up .
I can count the sheds on his sole &apos; .
under the th@@ under@@ storm : Mass@@ enk@@ ar@@ amb@@ ol@@ age on A8 : many injured
severe accident on Thursday evening on the A8 : nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a massage position .
there are numerous injured , mile @-@ long styles - and G@@ aff@@ er .
on the highway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A8 ) , some 20 people were injured in the morning of the morning of Thursday afternoon .
according to the first information of the police , there were about 17.00 hours between the junction of Adel@@ zh@@ ausen and O@@ del@@ zh@@ ausen ( County A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a ge@@ ant , nearly 30 vehicles , among them probably also lor@@ ries .
the exact number of accidents initially did not exceed any information .
it was mild to moderate injuries , a poli@@ omyel@@ itis said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a great en@@ dow@@ ment of rescue cars had been on the accident . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the A8 was completely closed in direction of Munich .
in the direction of Munich , some ten kilometers long back@@ log was formed .
as a AZ @-@ repor@@ ter reports , it was also on the counter @-@ run with massive disability - by many de@@ struc@@ tions .
the fire brig@@ ade recorded the signs of the vehicle , which now have more sensitive pen@@ alties .
shortly after 18 : 45 there was a second accident on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
it was a coll@@ ision between a car and car passenger car in a coll@@ ision .
rescue helicopter was on the way to accident .
Deutsche Bahn : Group testing &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced : nothing can sit in the train and sleeps .
or it has been deep@@ ens in his work and has just a brilliant mind .
and then : buff@@ ered .
comes the Schaff@@ ner and we@@ aves a gentle , or irrit@@ ate the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
ticket inspection control .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are over .
the Deutsche Bahn is currently testing certificate control .
it is just confirmed by mobile phone that you took its place and evalu@@ ates the ticket .
it is currently running on two routes .
&quot; comes the offer , we expand it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will probably be available to many other remote control circuits in Germany at the beginning of the year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a railway speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; is the train ticket by cards without Schaff@@ ner EMC .
to use the use , however , some requirements must be met : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to booked an online ticket - what we do already do most passengers .
it is also necessary to have purchased the DB Navigator app , which is the most comfortable way of ticket booking .
and last one needs a seating reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works like this : you will rise in the train , call his ticket &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My Ticket &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one button appears to an electronic release at the test customers .
access to their mobile devices will get a message that the g@@ ast X is situated in the train and the booked seat Y .
depends on the ticket inspection control in place Y , he knows that there is a passenger with previously valuable online ticket .
you can continue on , continue , continue to keep on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has two advantages : one for the customers , one for the train - which again use the passengers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; whoever wants to travel without ticket control by our train staff , check in the DB Navigator simply by yourself .
this allows passengers to design your travel time in the train of personal assistance , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing @-@ Management Board of DB Fern@@ traffic .
second Plus : &quot; and our employees have more time than today to enter the individual customer needs . &quot;
those who often travel , knows that in addition to delay and missed , ticket cards belong to the greatest doctors .
because often , one of the participants doesn &apos;t need all the documents that you need to use online tickets for the use of online tickets .
either the credit card or the identity card or otherwise an document needed .
the consequence are endless discussions between train att@@ endant and passenger , which leads to bad mood in the portion or greater area and del@@ ays at the control of his own tickets and taking the Schaff@@ ner at the end of time to take care of others .
only a small number of testing customers can use the new service .
this is also available at the ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .

&quot; &quot; &quot; how one activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 9 August 2014 , Britt@@ any Fer@@ rell was sh@@ aken to her core .
just one day after having arrived in New York City , sitting in St. Louis Prayer on the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment that they rented and sc@@ roll through Facebook on her phone .
stum@@ bled across a post by someone from the High School .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police has just killed a 18 year old child , and there is still on the street &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whose name was there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
conf@@ used as nobody had posted the information on their feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Ph@@ aro@@ ah has continuously prayed on their tim@@ eline .
the z@@ apper from the region of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white polic@@ emen of Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , Mo . , was killed live .
he posted an image of Brow@@ ns le@@ bl@@ os@@ em body that was stretched out on the street and would remain in four hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is wild , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ rell ten@@ ds &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but death was for them and their community nothing new .
she moved her cell to return to T@@ we@@ et on the Can@@ field Drive in late evening .
there were photos of police band and people , crying , and from a man who claimed to be a sign of Brow@@ ns father , who had a sign with the inscription : &quot; Fer@@ g@@ us@@ ons Police has just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
they observed a live feed when a polic@@ eman stood in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bell@@ hop dog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in another video , she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she assured a lot of polic@@ eman and cried , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will kill you ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not common , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rec@@ alled by Fer@@ rell &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the kind of murder , which we are acc@@ ust@@ omed to us and which we can call . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this moment , I felt a fro@@ st .
I was mad and wept . &quot;
they booked a return flight and went home next day .
after the landing at 23 o &apos;clock they took their 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from the house of her father and decided that the two would drive to Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on the next morning .
what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rell and Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , is the theme of a new feature film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in the cinem@@ as from the 11th century .
there is a history of survival and protest , love and loss , the strength and power of resistance , which consists of the vision of men who are living in community and filled the streets to request answers .
as Fer@@ rell with her daughter , who wore a cau@@ lif@@ ter and a matching crown , the two were a conversation which they had countless times before this morning &quot; on the black experience and the black condition . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remembered how I taught you when black people have to fight for that ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; remember what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now go to Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on because the police killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy , and that was not right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I could not take it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rell said later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must know it and to see it and pulled it in it .
it must be well developed , not only acti@@ vis@@ m and organisation , but also know the various layers of the black experience and the black Constitution and what we must do to liber@@ ate ourselves .
even if I have good fortune to give you a experience where she personally experienced no lat@@ an@@ ism , it is not different than the next black women child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have the feeling I would give you a bad service to keep them far off . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first station , when they arrived in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a location opposite the police station , which was kept at a camp site when the activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ charge of Chief Financial Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there , Fer@@ rell and her daughter have joined together with a local business owner .
they prepared bags before and hal@@ ve them to put them on dis@@ appearances .
slowly , a new kind of acti@@ vis@@ m began to accept form for Fer@@ rell Mis@@ se .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my acti@@ vis@@ m changed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after 9 August totally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said as a student at the University of Missouri @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student Affairs Association and focused on food @-@ justice and health in@@ equ@@ alities in black communities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
it has all come . &quot;
weeks later he met Fer@@ rell during an evening demonstration Sab@@ a@@ ah fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ director of the film .
Fol@@ ay@@ an said , she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r wanted only &quot; document what happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a question came to Fer@@ rell in the sense : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will you document , or tries to find a story that you can use ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sc@@ ep@@ ti@@ c@@ ism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often from White - in a community that benef@@ ited from their pain and resistance .
as fol@@ ay@@ an recently declared : &quot; we had heard that people who were born in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on and raised up their voices , and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
fol@@ ay@@ an had worked together with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area that is known for his acti@@ vis@@ m rum around To@@ dest@@ iny occup@@ ants .
his engagement brought Fer@@ rell the Project closer , along with six other native loc@@ als followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brow@@ ns shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we speak , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Davis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the main thing for me as these people are represented , for so I will be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not to concentrate on Fer@@ rel@@ ls experience - to show that it is not a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Messiah &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but for a community , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - it proved to be the most obvious participant in the film . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fol@@ d@@ ingly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sur@@ prisingly personal aspects of Fer@@ rel@@ ls lives , as she loves and married her wife . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell and laugh@@ ed when they saw the final product for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understood that there must be one of the so@@ vereig@@ n@@ ty for this work , and in the realization of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fer@@ rel@@ ls &apos;s history is repeated the role of black gay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves movement .
two of the three fo@@ unders of movement , who have marked the film &quot; Black@@ liv@@ es@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in 2012 , marked the film &quot; Black@@ liv@@ es@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media , identify themselves as a gay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried out the movement , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we are constantly strug@@ gling with different fron@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; black , pregnant women must wear the main load of everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fol@@ ay@@ an voted to be noted that &quot; the movement is really held by black women and many black women . &quot;
however , it is that &quot; this is not a &quot; creative type of action , &quot; at which Fer@@ rell has been selected as the heart of the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was the person who sh@@ ook these energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not a co@@ incidence , though it was on the front , because in a life of these cruci@@ fix@@ tures than a black , pregnant woman is so much on the game . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you can feel her energy through the screen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the meantime , the news of the news of Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on have gone disappeared , but the ra@@ ci@@ ary connections between the congregation and the police continue .
Fer@@ rell is on proof for 2 ½ years due to the blocking of a highway at a demonstration .
she describes the soci@@ op@@ olit@@ ical atmosphere of the area that she calls her home : &quot; a chaos &quot; .
nevertheless , she atten@@ ds to a singing and she felt committed to this memory , since she went far from Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on onto the street three years ago .
&quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we need to love one another and support .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; dream &quot; to &quot; magn@@ itude w@@ ahn &quot; : TV @-@ readers discuss about bit gallery
the bit gallery moves people , although it is not yet built long .
but the idea of a shopping centre on the south of the pedestrian zone has been split since the first presentation of 2009 the population in ob@@ sc@@ ents and opponents .
cold is hardly visible .
also on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg , &quot; the topic is discussed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while the one @-@ bit gallery say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this would be a dream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Anja Becker ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Nicole Becker ) , comes from the other side : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no man needs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ eds ) or rather simple : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the advoc@@ ate that there is no more customers coming into the city , of which also the other stores take advantage , the opponent fears that then the pedestrian zone p@@ us@@ her@@ ed .
in addition , the gallery is planned exactly on the property , on which the farm market stands , in which 13 directors are marketing their products .
the construction work will be finished with the beginning of the construction work .
the Gallery M@@ acher aim to integrate a Mark@@ thalle in the new building - as well as Bed@@ a @-@ ranked with possibility to sit down outside .
Simone Rooms : &quot; we &apos;ve been buying almost weekly in the pe@@ as@@ antry market for many years .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the land are very happy again .
we also discovered the but@@ cher shop for us .
we would like to wish you , during and especially after the construction of the gallery a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is also that .
the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; if direct market is located in a market hall in the gallery , coming to the height of the rental .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new project should probably be low as well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva Kil@@ ic : &quot; what is the most commercial stalli@@ on in Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothing , shoes , dr@@ ills or supermarkets : I think it su@@ perf@@ lu@@ ous .
there are already enough in our city .
one can see how many shop@@ pers are empty here - some for months and years .
but there &apos;s not once again a regular weekly market , it is more important that we will remain at least the market hall .
for all , the goods offered are fresh , is mostly offered directly from the producer and is ob@@ end@@ lessly .
as you can see , shop stores are rented in a shopping mall only from bigger firms , because the flat rentals are often not tra@@ gic .
too bad , special stores there are almost no more and what still remains , will probably even disappear . &quot;
Wolf F@@ act : &quot; a shopping mall with a market hall will not fit for me together .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
above all : where is the pe@@ as@@ antry market during the construction time ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even on duration if the bit gallery is actually coming .
or does it create the gh@@ ost bit gallery before , all shops out of Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; that will not be functioning .
and shopping center , which stands empty , nobody needs no one .
my opinion it would have been better to promote a real farm market instead of this gallery .
but there is no room for a farming market thanks to the mad many - how I find - sen@@ sel@@ ess building projects in Bit@@ burg no space anymore .
when the pe@@ as@@ mark@@ thalle is made , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
in the middle of the room of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York are many faces to see - white , black and brown , which are almost invisible - that can hang on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg in W@@ angen @-@ T@@ up@@ nes and Haar@@ lem , which were sent to you by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent a 35 @-@ year prison sentence from prison Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where the former secret service analy@@ tics had a 35 @-@ year sentence , after they publicly opened diplomatic messages about the site of Wiki@@ Le@@ aks .
the new exhibition that was opened on August 2nd , is called A Bec@@ oming Res@@ em@@ bl@@ ance ( An appropriate simil@@ arity ) .
she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline was written by De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline was converted by Barack Obama , whose convic@@ tion was converted by Barack Obama , when he had only three days in his office .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has been extracted by the algorithms analysis of DNA , which could be extracted from the 30 portraits , such as someone could not only interpre@@ t the form@@ ability of DNA data - the many ways , how they can interpre@@ t and the inher@@ ent determin@@ ants of these interpre@@ tations , but also for identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but since their doll had spoken openly about the identification than woman , was convicted in 2013 for 20 charges , including six violations of the sp@@ ying law , computer and theft .
through the prison its image was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only one photo - a grain , black @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing sits comfortably on a driver &apos;s seat and a plat@@ ine bl@@ onde is associated with it .
in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg returned from the big success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Vis@@ ions &apos; .
in it , the artist portraits of foreig@@ ner from for@@ en@@ ical ar@@ te@@ facts such as cigarette smoke and chew@@ ing g@@ um , extracts the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how people could look like .
that was the time to which it has received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they led an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing , while she was in prison , and they wanted to accompany this article , &quot; declared De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg with a press preview of the new exhibition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and they could not visit at that time and could not be photograph@@ ed , so they took contact with Chelsea and asked whether they wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and its imprisoned M@@ use were dis@@ closed to un@@ fortun@@ ate bri@@ bes , which had inter@@ changeable several letters in the course of two years .
they even made a shot by Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o illustrated com@@ ic &quot; Supp@@ os@@ som@@ ebody , &quot; which was fore@@ seen a future when the President Chel@@ ate Jud@@ gment would not be able to see the exhibition personally .
that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published , cre@@ denti@@ als would be demanded in a military prison in Kansas , was a welcome type of lucky gathering .
there are now also at the opening of the exhibition a little deep and strong , since Donald Tr@@ ump leads a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against Trans@@ fron@@ tier troops to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to re@@ medy the rigid divisions , which he actually should fix it .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , following the wei@@ rd timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things went out of a given reason . &quot;
in one of the gallery of the gallery , Mann@@ ing with its super@@ large signature of them ( the &quot; i &quot; in their family name is equipped with a heart ) an end of &quot; automatic break@@ down , the basis of gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
on the opposite wall , their mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence is an exchange of Cs and Gs and As , in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , hop@@ ed by the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or Nu@@ st@@ ot@@ ide according to the high @-@ developed scientific en@@ cyclo@@ pe@@ dia of artist ) , such as amaz@@ ingly similar , at least in biological terms , we all are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what &apos;s hop@@ efully we will take care of that our gen@@ ome does not care that we are and how openly about genetic data for a interpretation and how sub@@ jective them are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work was shown in 2007 , &quot; ious mem@@ ories , &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories . &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition that is kept in an own room is a page from the above mentioned Com@@ ic @-@ Nov@@ elle .
it shows Mann@@ ing , as she appeared with a hands @-@ free fall in hand from the discipl@@ ines of the United States such as King Kong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they put down your words , they have won , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s never the mouth . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter which she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist who gre@@ et the Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am still seeing a go@@ os@@ see if I speak it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition - as it was predicted in the Com@@ ic book - but when it was supposed to do it , she will be gre@@ eted in the middle of the room of the mas@@ ks , of their own gen@@ om@@ ic simulation which collec@@ ts themselves together as hor@@ des of Protest@@ ants .
that was also targeted as everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 , 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ ature ) , where their genetic h@@ ap@@ log@@ ists were written with pencil .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had them in the past , but I wanted to feel like a crowd , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted to feel like a mass movement , which formed himself with Chelsea , as movement which was also behind their liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the Management team of Grand Plaza published an explanation about the residents : &quot; the police currently works at the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim and resear@@ ches a variety of moti@@ fs , including a possible domestic approach . &quot;
&quot; we will close the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future , &quot; - Russian Vice President Mut@@ ko
the Russian deputy hon@@ ors Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said that it will not take long until the remaining criteria of the world anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; in a certain stage of the fulfil@@ ment of the criteria of the road@@ map R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK anti @-@ D@@ oping ) .
the WA@@ DA @-@ Sche@@ dule was updated in this regard , &quot; explained Mut@@ ko on Thursday .
the PM commented on the second part of the road@@ map of WA@@ DA for adher@@ ence to the code that describes the criteria for the restoration of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and recently published on the organisation &apos;s website .
according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain any such reason for Russia .
&quot; everything was announced , everything will be implemented .
and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) and the WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; he added .
one of the criteria mentioned in the list , however , states that the Russian anti @-@ D@@ oping authorities approved the findings of the WA@@ DA authorized results in the Russian sport publicly sponsored by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in relation to the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we lead the investigation into a mistake by our anti @-@ intelligence system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there were no government programs , and we will not aband@@ on what does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mut@@ k@@ os words agree with those of Vit@@ ality Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v , the leader of the independent Russian anti @-@ D@@ oping Commission .
in conversation with Russian sales office R@@ Sport at the beginning of the day Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v answered problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ D@@ oping organisations , said : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report disputed controversi@@ al positions and regulations .
no one added to accept this report un@@ conditi@@ onally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded in November 2015 during D@@ oping @-@ Sk@@ and@@ als from the implementation of D@@ oping control in Russia .
however , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK anti @-@ D@@ oping ( U@@ K@@ AD ) .
following a visit to the main quarters of the Organisation in Moscow in July , WA@@ DA @-@ Director Olivier Nig@@ gli that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA stated that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA is moving to the right direction .

in addition to the sn@@ ap @-@ pol@@ ls and pol@@ ls of certain teams , it offers a heat map of the company that shows at a glance that units have most complaints and which exec@@ utives have low condition results - so that you can see .
companies come to see that you need to see that at the top of the workplace culture , so you will not be the next U@@ ber , who has published a blog post in Sk@@ and@@ ale since then , who describes a field of har@@ ass@@ ations , with the those who have spoken is punished .
for start @-@ ups like G@@ lin@@ t , this wish is an overview of a lu@@ cr@@ ative business option .

Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Conver@@ ters , the company helps to prevent bad behavior and to detect , saw a rise of interest and activity in the beginning of this year in the heart of the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit
Conver@@ tible has almost 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tesla .
u@@ ber signed up recently as a client .
like G@@ lin@@ t , Conver@@ ting Conver@@ ting companies tail@@ ored &quot; Pul@@ s &quot; to send confi@@ dential answers in real time and watch the warmth cards of your problem .
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line with the employees .
and when the managing director is involved , complaints are directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Court of public opinion recorded the reg@@ ul@@ ators , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Patrick Quin@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Conver@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a company is found , which holds its staff po@@ or@@ ly or ir@@ eth@@ ically , it can experience co@@ stly consequences by consumers @-@ boy@@ cott , workers fluctu@@ ation and complaints , Quin@@ lan told .
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites , has Conver@@ tible for more than one year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures , and a simple way to reach their company headquarters .
earlier , if a cler@@ k wanted a problem , he had to find or send them a telephone number or email for the corporate headquarters , a formal appeal , and hope he was serious .
it was often an in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation and un@@ comfortable experience , James Vit@@ rano , Ruby TU@@ ES@@ DA@@ YS General Coun@@ sel , who said , there was no good opportunity to pursue the complaints of employees .
now , since the company Conver@@ ting Conver@@ ters may have problems that were previously hidden by exec@@ utives which were hidden in offices in cities or countries , such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment , or in@@ correct internship , are identified and be addressed .
&quot; I can approach closer to these holi@@ stic , 360 degree view in experience with employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who leads the risk management Group of Ruby Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment legal disputes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies began in 2002 , Eth@@ ics , Val@@ ues and Emplo@@ ye@@ es engagement in 2002 , after the accounting company Arthur Andersen conducted for eth@@ ical violations by the En@@ ron Sk@@ andal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it took until the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social media came to their right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that they knew not that you could not prevent her dirty washing online . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the use of technology for monitoring Eth@@ ics , people used as a strategy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both G@@ lin@@ t and Conver@@ ters offer your software as a service , and damp@@ en the company with recur@@ ring fees for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance that will find the consent of Venture Capital investors which both start @-@ ups .
Conver@@ ters received $ 10 million in financing in February of companies such as Sapphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , which raised the entire capital to $ 47 million .
gl@@ itz@@ es secured $ 10 million in November by B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners and brought his total funding to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising considering the networked nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex in research , which shows that today &apos;s employees expect more than so far .
in competitive markets such as Sil@@ icon Valley are high concentrations of and interesting projects only .
the staff want to have the feeling that you are accepted and estimated that you give your time a company with a positive mission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the people are glad to feel in a company , that the work which you do is worthwhile , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global benefits , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Benef@@ its , who uses both Conver@@ ters and G@@ lin@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot;
investors reach R@@ end@@ ites when its portfolio company run well . companies run well when employees are employed and are engaged .
if the Analytics Tools received third parties to increase commitment and use of employees , it is no miracle that you can find support .
the data on employees commitment after the experts of workplace culture is important .
but the data are us@@ eless when the administrator of an enterprise do not take action .
in fact , if a company asks staff after your feedback , it can have a anticip@@ ation that the change is on the way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if the change occurs not fast enough , or even at all , this dis@@ appoint@@ ments for breeding and employees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you have to be ready to have 4,000 convers@@ ations , &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kot@@ ter International , the company has seen themselves to leave collecting data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you don &apos;t follow the employees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you take care of yourself ?
and who doesn &apos;t take care of , why should I take ? &quot;
Madison Reed , who now run monthly employees in monthly surveys , was able to initi@@ ate measures in the same day when a problem is reported to be reported that salvation .
and after the collecting of feedback of fru@@ str@@ ated employees , it was made by the speed of decision @-@ making and the quality of communication , capable of organize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to tackle the problems .
at Ruby Tuesday the company will always get new insights on the staff , and it hopes that for a long sight , this leads to a better binding of employees in a sector , which is well @-@ known for high sales .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose men , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you lose man , you lose the customer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if you lose customers , you will lose your company .
the N@@ CAA elimin@@ ates the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for brood
at 23 o &apos;clock there is a lot of U@@ CL@@ A Foot@@ ball@@ ads on one side of the new training fields of the team on campus .
some have gone out their tri@@ angular parts and show the back full of silence from the first day of training camp .
a lunch break for a good part of the team .
players who are enrolled in the summer courses are return to their final inspec@@ tions , before they return to the Water@@ man Football Center on the next morning at 6 : 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real tac@@ tile mill for the next three days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before Monday to Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CAA elimin@@ ates two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the load of the player , and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday .
for this reason , the first three training sessions of the U@@ CL@@ A should begin at 19 : 15 in order to meet the already fully packed tim@@ est@@ ates of the players .
the compromise between the two days is more than one day after the break@@ down the start of the Camp@@ s almost a week after the last season and during the summer school was post@@ pon@@ ed during the summer time during mor@@ as six playing times in West@@ wood .
they must be kept in the course of August 18 exercises , 20 before the beginning of the formal games for its pre@@ lu@@ de against Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said that he would support the regul@@ ating change of the N@@ CAA support , even if they add the multiple routes of the player another point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this tremend@@ ous load on three or four days , and it is very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they simply ex@@ presses it , and they rejoice , they are great men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we will come up to Saturday and we have more time , it will really great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U@@ CL@@ A will end their practices as soon as the camp is terminated , which in view of the clear sight of its fields of an adjacent lot of fields and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the elevated class , which will have no easy task .
Bru@@ ges players should occup@@ y the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a dre@@ amed that it might issue a problem as soon as those rooms are free during the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will use our security , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far off to remember that people would rent a room there and then set aside for a exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the video and from an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good business .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best , with what we have .
I &apos;m not wor@@ ried anymore .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts in the fight against counter@@ f@@ eit messages
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false messages from third parties and their results under the original contribution , the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight out F@@ ake @-@ News .
the company said in a statement on its website that it will begin with the use of updated mechan@@ ic learning methods to detect possible false messages and send them to fact that it may display the result of the fact test from the original article .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the major component for so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ News , of which many believed that they also have influenced the U.S. presidential elections in 2016 .
the problem is also become a major political topic in Europe , whereby the French voters are to be punished in May with false stories , when it does not succeed to remove the social media networks as soon as before the elections there in September quickly .
on Thursday , Facebook has told us in a separate explanation of German that in the United States , France , the Netherlands and Germany will be launched a test of new facts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; next to the realisation of the third parties , people want to focus more context , in order to make detailed decisions about it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sara Su , Product Manager for Facebook News in one blog . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that Facebook continues its feature to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; testing the article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the connection of the article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and to other changes to its messages &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; feed to decrease false messages . &quot; &quot; &quot;
creating a com@@ ic @-@ novel : a Castle in the History of England
in his younger past , the small Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squ@@ e@@ eze music video and was for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in the 1970 &quot; s and 1980 @-@ ies .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced a tur@@ bul@@ ent history of his comfortable seat in the Be@@ w@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent , and is now for inspiration for a graphical novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a mop@@ hair@@ y Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ k@@ h@@ man with a pre@@ ference for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it is so beautiful to look at the manuscript by someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what a personal relationship , this letter can hold in my hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; re@@ plen@@ ished the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documented the families who lived in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by Isaac Lenk@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des that is based on an archive : he wrote in 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project which he did un@@ exp@@ ec@@ tedly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only took on the thum@@ b pressure on the side of a letter , who was written by a double agents in the 1700 &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is his thum@@ b pressure !
and his letters sc@@ ram@@ bled to smoke , because then a fire was kindled because of the light .
for someone who lives for 300 years later , the smell has an effect as he himself would be .
I , I love Archive ! &quot;
for someone who struck with old pap@@ al that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England , and almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be hon@@ est , I have been a little bit of welcome &quot; ) seems to be very nice to be true .
Rho@@ dos spent his days to explore the Vic@@ tor@@ ian &quot; New Castle Castle that had to view the archives and had spent many treasures and cour@@ i@@ os@@ ities of the castle , such as the mon@@ oc@@ ated hy@@ s@@ heads in the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the tr@@ ench .
he emigrated through the area and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with farmers , gar@@ dener and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
then , at night , he drank &quot; Whis@@ key and began to write . &quot;
the intimate story of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , since the National Trust was only received full access until 2006 , when the last Er@@ am , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey died .
when Rho@@ des entered a decade later , employees were just to worry about the archive , which he said as &quot; hundreds of years , in which arist@@ ocr@@ ats said &quot; Oh , wir@@ f it in the attic . &quot;
di@@ aries , letters from the time of the English Emp@@ ires , maps , those who owned : &quot; one could mean that land restoration would be bor@@ ing , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to fought the two families .
guys , let all go away ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection , use the castle as a starting point to join the wider base in the English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man , who built the newly built castle to join the pe@@ as@@ antry of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a record of a ri@@ ot that appeared in the castle 13@@ 80 , in this book with the title &apos; Kn@@ igh@@ tly Famil@@ ies of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; Rho@@ des .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the farms began in this area and I thought there was a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps these two are connected together ? &quot;
other stories are firmly ro@@ oted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est , which told the history of the Jesu@@ it Patent , the Dar@@ rell ten@@ ured seven years during the English Reformation .
or &apos; The Sm@@ ug@@ gler &apos; , shown in which the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers Arthur Dar@@ rell ten@@ dered his own fun@@ eral , filled with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later when his sar@@ g was du@@ g out ) .
the Dar@@ rel@@ ls are Rho@@ des &apos;s favorite family of Scot@@ ia : &quot; the gent@@ l@@ emen seemed to be appropriate cheer@@ ful , and again make money for things that they could not aff@@ ord themselves .
other generations of Dar@@ rell @-@ men sli@@ pped their debt crisis , having married to me as a bun@@ ch of well @-@ looking boys , with a talent , to promote our inheritance . &quot;
after the end of its application in the castle Rho@@ des in search of other unique Schrei@@ b experiences
he has brought a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a com@@ ic novel about El@@ se@@ ed@@ m@@ ä@@ ki behind , the site of a san@@ atorium in the early 20th century , which has since been rec@@ la@@ imed by nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back again , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to be finished with the dam@@ n lives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign started : over 300 years old Marien@@ kap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the aim of the 301 @-@ year @-@ old Marien@@ kap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the city of Bad Honnef last Friday began its campaign to launch a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau ) .
even on Thursday , Mayor Otto N@@ EU@@ HO@@ FF and his marketing team around Nelson Art@@ z keep the logo and slogan for their slogan .
at the end of August it is meant to take a celebration of the campaign on Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th Island .
&quot; to get to us . &quot;
or ? , &quot; the makers of Aktion since yesterday appeared on the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dor@@ fer chapel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we think that ( of course ! ) do not really think &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; write it on her yesterday website . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but we use this measure to win your attention .
and in order to make clear that man@@ ches seems better than it seems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; basically , we are the firm that we know as a bath of Hon@@ ne@@ fer citizens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the action there is more than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logo and slogan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is true to form an outstanding promise that gives an un@@ mist@@ ak@@ able unique place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
finally , in competition with other municipalities .
the city of Bad Honnef last for a mid @-@ digit amount to their new umbrella brand and the campaign .
military re@@ forms in Turkey - Erd@@ og@@ an fear of the army
every year in early August , Ankara on the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ as ) on pension funds and grants in army officers .
so this week .
on the first sight a normal process .
but nothing is routine in the Turkish armed forces a year after the coup attempt .
the session did not take place in the buildings of the General Staff , as previously , but in the office of prime minister .
under the presidency of the Government , the five Vice Premier@@ ed , as well as the Minister for Defense , Interior , Justice and Foreign Affairs .
so the civilians were in the Y@@ as in the over@@ count .
the government attrac@@ ts the re@@ ins .
the Chief of Staff Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in ministry , but the Com@@ man@@ de@@ ure of the He@@ eres , the Air Force and the Marine have been depos@@ ed .
since the failed Cou@@ p , Head of Head Erd@@ og@@ an 169 of the 326 gener@@ als and ad@@ mir@@ als has been fired .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the Army &apos;s series - mostly due to alleged connections to the motion of exile @-@ Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , the Erd@@ og@@ an as wire @-@ saving of the coup .
for 486 people , which should have been involved with the attempt at the coup , is negoti@@ ated in Ankara since this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the day after the coup , Erd@@ og@@ an had called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; divine gift &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because he would grant him the opportunity to de@@ file the armed forces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but has Erd@@ og@@ an really in handle ?
at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; Hur@@ ri@@ yet published an article entitled &quot; Un@@ dis@@ comfort in the Military @-@ headquarters . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Staff to give concerns &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to an increasing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which manifested itself among others in the repe@@ aling of the head of the case , the newspaper wrote &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the large cle@@ aring at the Army and security forces continues anyway .
in mid @-@ July , Erd@@ og@@ an sent an additional 73@@ 95 Heads of State , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 546 Sol@@ di@@ ers .
thus it seemed to be t@@ amed on the military .
the gener@@ als former than the actual gent@@ l@@ emen of the country .
three co@@ aches them in appeal to their role as a gu@@ ardi@@ ans of the world@@ ly state rules .
following his election victory in 2002 , Erd@@ og@@ an promoted the power of the military step by step , not least under calling for the reform leaders of the European Union .
ex officers say , Erd@@ og@@ an in@@ hibition targeted a Islam@@ ist of the armed forces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warned against persecution from persecution against asylum in foreign country abroad , the Turkish army must be &quot; full of extreme extrem@@ ists and Sal@@ af@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it affects this , such an development could not be cold . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no doubt in the alliance after the pur@@ ge doub@@ ts of doubt the use of the Turkish army . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the leadership structures and operational skills are &quot; weak@@ ened &quot; says Nato diplom@@ ats .
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
it will give a new US immigration plan to change the Green Card rules , said President Donald Tr@@ ump , quoted from the media .
he sees prior to reduce legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter requirements for long @-@ term work permit and limitations for families @-@ oriented Visa .
the new rules are proposed and supported by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans and supported by the President .

this new candidate procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English to help themselves and knowledge the financial means to themselves and knowledge , &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted from the American media .
Ministry wants to san@@ itation route for racing shuttle
over the past few months , I had been fought against the future of the racing platform - now it should go quickly .
even before the end of the year , the route is scheduled to be built on which the tourist tooth is built .
to ensure the future of the racing gra@@ utt@@ les in the long term , according to the Ministry of Transport , according to this year , construction work will start on the track .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the decision to continue to order and san@@ itation the route of Ilmenau @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g , the country is particularly important for tourism important &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; stated secretary of State Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Erfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs for the repair of the circuit fell to approximately 2.5 million euros .
of this sum , the country over@@ take 75 percent .
the contract , based on which the shuttle must also be ordered in the future of the country , is currently defin@@ iti@@ vely voted , declared S@@ üh@@ l .
the Ministry and the South @-@ ür@@ ingen railway used to be tra@@ ded over the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the proposed contract between the Ministry and the Railway Corporation will be closed for eleven years .
that means that the race @-@ service shuttle will be available from December 2017 .
the race @-@ circuit shuttle is a popular railway connection between Ilmenau and racing platform , especially for tourists .
in the past months , in the course of a pilot operation , the distance of suff@@ ici@@ ently many people is used to order it again in the future .
the distance is also di@@ lap@@ id@@ ated in parts .
the Asc@@ ent of Sex Rob@@ ots is real , and we should worry about it
just as you thought it will not be crazy for 2017 , a new report about the technological developments in the field of sex robots .
Yes , indeed .
sex robots are currently a great thing .
recently the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ) ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , emer@@ itus Professor of Robotics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of FR@@ R , we must start their asc@@ ension .
customers can choose the eyel@@ ids of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pp@@ le and type of fing@@ ern@@ a@@ gel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people do not make fun , but the company deliver every amount of it , and we will still get much more common , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Shar@@ key during the publication of his new report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern be@@ ats have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin , which feels warm - with consci@@ ously human reactions , which can be achieved by artificial intelligence .
the user can also adjust the robot in accordance with its belie@@ fs , &quot; and in order to select everything from the eyel@@ ids of the robot on the form of breast canc@@ ers up to the type or the color of its fing@@ ern@@ ails .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it will still be troubled because many robots would have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; person@@ alities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who would like a Step@@ ford woman progressive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern s@@ exp@@ ir@@ ppen have developed to robots with a silicone skin .
the Real@@ Bot@@ ix @-@ robot enables users to custom@@ ize its users to adapt their robots to the properties , such as ti@@ mi@@ ity .
and then there is still the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold sex robot with pre @-@ programmed person@@ alities such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah &quot; which gives the impression of ti@@ red@@ ness and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with a &quot; advent@@ u@@ rous &quot; personality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality which is as good as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; True The website of True Compan@@ ion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so you like what you like , and they don &apos;t like what you like , etc .
it has also in the course of the day - quite as real people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; it may be tired of fixed to conversation or it can be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in atmosphere &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many un@@ comfortable aspects on this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ divided female properties , the announ@@ cements on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( is here : resi@@ sted ) Far@@ rah , calm one of the most .
true to his website the Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibration , but for men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator why men can &apos;t have Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is on the website . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , this sex robot is not just a fat or content just a different st@@ on@@ eware .
their emergence or increasing refin@@ ement point to a little dar@@ ker and deeper understanding of our culture , to re@@ treat the Ideal of Gender Equality towards a wish of sex with sub @-@ tension than optional en@@ core .
most guys are of course not with@@ hold sex robots , while the FR@@ R re@@ members its rising popularity , they still remain provisional on the edge of consumer culture .
but what about the edge of the bound@@ ary zones that we can live in terms of the spirit of time , in which we live , very instru@@ c@@ tive .
and many people are not strange or ins@@ ul@@ ting , until they are the free market for permission .
there is a certain over@@ l@@ ance that these highly developed sex robot in a time being endangered in which the rights of women are threatened worldwide , in which the White House gives an President to attack women sexu@@ alized violence .
the most terrible aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the ma@@ id@@ servant &apos; ) are not the graphical pictures , the worn body and the extinct eyes , but like realistic this vision .
the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but it does not feel like a big jump .
the goal behind this sex robot is to produce a physical simil@@ arity to real women as realistic as technically possible ( if also with Por@@ no@@ star pro@@ por@@ tions ) .
her lovers will feel that they feel human beings to im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but , at the point , if it goes around its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; person@@ alities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the robots make no real women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they can not be separated from their companion or simply go away .
they do not have a transmission or background history , nothing that suggests to independence or anything , that could distur@@ b the imagination of a total amount .
others said : they are pleasing slaves .
or to express it in the Rede@@ mption of 2017 : maid
tr@@ umps large performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney to analy@@ ze sound human beings
it has become a binding of the tr@@ ump @-@ era that the political circuits that have polar@@ izes the U.S. elec@@ torate , also families in small @-@ format .
around Christmas and Harvest Festival , there were in the USA newspapers with advice about how to deal with hor@@ ror from Tr@@ ump to relatives .
we ex@@ amp@@ h@@ let all supp@@ os@@ edly left our filter bub@@ bles .
less noticed is the power of Tr@@ umps , Famil@@ ies together .
I mention this because my c@@ ousin , a left @-@ oriented imper@@ ator who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in our family , this week has visited me in New York .
they remembered that the unit can have a strong effect against the joint enemy .
when Tr@@ ump in the White House is everyone who knows it , including the republi@@ can mind , with which she fought for decades due to the politics , suddenly and very strange to the same page .
in order to make the dining table it is certainly a good thing , but it falls to me in another context that this also causes considerable risks .
the left hand was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the Per@@ forming effect of his Presidency has the power to push us all right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we speak of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normal@@ ization &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Tr@@ ump , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we refer to the gr@@ us@@ el@@ ly possibility that we will not deny us his seed of a day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is however still a fri@@ gh@@ tening long @-@ time scenario , in the Tr@@ ump Repub@@ lic@@ ans of the right wing &quot; normal@@ ized , &quot; which suddenly appeared in comparison to his standards , suddenly appeared as in@@ comprehen@@ sible attack .
I found me today from active nost@@ al@@ gic for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s funny version of Ver@@ back@@ wards - the dog on car od@@ ach that saw 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax returns ) - both in comparison to Tr@@ ump in fact occur as very mild criminal off@@ ences .
when Tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans should only be spiritu@@ ally healthy to qualify for an un@@ meas@@ ur@@ able improvement .
when my c@@ ousin in the city was , we brought our children to Car@@ ou@@ sel in Central Park , the largest of the car@@ ou@@ sel of the New York City department , and the best three dollars that you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need caffeine .
the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are cris@@ p and the animals are turning to watch over their own shoul@@ ders - very fin@@ ster and the climate of music provides a notable way .
so many pictures of a city dis@@ appoint . the views of high buildings will become old , the Sky@@ lines will be familiar to offer a lot of exc@@ it@@ ement , and the reality of the city will not be just the dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I am still not all over the day as I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed no Swiss Cottage , but the subject @-@ pub ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not yet - but a large roundabout in the north of London .
however , Central Park @-@ Kar@@ us@@ sel is still a strange experience , since here two years old , an 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ years can go on it and all have a great time .
if I would like to evaluate the Car@@ ou@@ sel , I would have given him the full score but fortunately no one was asked for luck .
on the other hand , I was forced to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could go through my credit card .
at the corner of my road , it &apos;s the same , plus the option to cover the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the shop table .
this does not only lead to a slow@@ down , which should actually be a neutral exchange , but also exer@@ ting pressure on the server to bring personality to a situation in which no need is required .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the poor woman in the department store was exc@@ it@@ ous , while I got tired of the experience to submit my credit card with five stars . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us moved to the hospital with breast pain
Pist@@ ori@@ us leave the prison for a hospital visit for the second time .
last year , he was brought into the hospital for the treatment of in@@ cis@@ ions to the hospital , which he suffered from the prison government according to a case in his cell .
Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to murder in prison for murder in appeal for murder .
he killed jet@@ ty in the early hours of Valent@@ ina 2013 by taking them several times by a door of the toilet cabin in his home in Pre@@ toria on her .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he held his gir@@ l@@ friend for a n@@ igh@@ teenth year@@ ling who hidden himself in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention to in@@ dul@@ ge this time against the six @-@ year prison sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell where they say that she is very dense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the National Criminal Office &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; claims that it would be lifted up at the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the appeal could be heard this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us is at risk that his penalty will be increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have been successful .
there are no death penalty in South Africa .
as Bauer Arnold a remarkable egg finds
as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools the four @-@ t@@ äss@@ ler from Fü@@ tz@@ en and Ep@@ fen@@ ho@@ fen were dismissed in the holidays and in the secondary schools .
three of the students will go to the school , four at the secondary school .
school teacher Angel@@ ika S@@ itte gre@@ eted parents and representatives of the public in the mayor of Bi@@ es@@ ental in Ep@@ ide@@ ho@@ fen .
as a symbol for the school dis@@ covering the 29 pupils of the four classes were accompanied by Sophia Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der a young eagle , which grows in chicken farm , but then it is fired into freedom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this case the m@@ ist Sch@@ ar led a musical with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The eagle in the chicken farm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmer Arnold found a strange egg , and got it away from his chick@@ ens .
instead of a chicken rain@@ water there came out a small eagle .
but the hope of which a chicken spread out of him , spread the eagle spread upon a high mountain of his wings , and s@@ acked .
afterwards , classes three and four were present in the study of Y@@ v@@ onne Frank a chicken ance .

indeed , the young was different than the other young ( cows ) , but it belongs to it .
but I will never be like a chicken .
his appointment is to be free .
they w@@ ished every four @-@ t@@ ug@@ ly that he feels at his new school .
it followed thanks to the donation to the col@@ leg@@ ac@@ ies , former school manager Michael Müller , who again jumps back to class@@ mates , and the parents leaders .
the Kü@@ ken@@ ing period is now over , the class@@ room Sophia Schumacher announced .
she leave her students after two years of teaching , for a really great time had been .
finally , they can rely on the square wat@@ ery .

software update for diesel vehicles : what the data subject must now know
how exactly will the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers have to participate in the promotion ?
an overview of the most important questions and answers .
at the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW @-@ Group software offers software updates for a total of approximately 5.3 million cars .
they are to improve the emission behavior of cars of emission classes Euro 5 and in part Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ Diesel or worse are exemp@@ ted from it .
Anja S@@ met@@ anin of ACE Auto Club Europe are inv@@ alu@@ ation :
is the new action mandatory ?
no , the included software updates are voluntary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mandatory updates previously only apply for vehicles to do Schumann &apos;s software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their ref@@ itting has ordered the Federal Office of the Federal Office ( KBA ) .
how and when customers are informed about updates ?
the makers have announced a fast implementation in the next few months , but not an exact date .
Daimler informed us to write any person concerned .
if it is due to inspec@@ tions , this will be done in their frames .
how long shall the change equ@@ ipping altogether ?
&quot; difficult to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ anin .
the connections from the presence of manufacturers as well as from political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for we have seen that the car manufacturers do not act so far beyond the environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long shall it take update ?
the retro@@ fitting itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
time consuming it could be an appointment .
what do drivers do , who do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW @-@ Group ?
the ACE will be waiting for .
probably foreign manufacturers would follow , so S@@ met@@ anin .
is now a massive price drop of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE fears that .
but just in the regions where driving dro@@ pping threat@@ ening .
in rural space there is no impair@@ ment losses for older diesel .
the ACE will be tra@@ pped with sale yet .

the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most successful events in Washington .
the first award ceremony under President Tr@@ ump promises to be polit@@ ically .
one of the winners will not come - from protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) gets the first ra@@ pper one of the prestigious Kennedy Center .
like the cultural institutions on Thursday announced this year also singer Gloria E@@ ste@@ fan ( 59 ) , Li@@ on@@ el Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the chore@@ ograph@@ er Carmen de Lav@@ all@@ ade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) .
prizes will be handed over to the start of December .
traditionally , US president Donald Tr@@ ump will stage a reception and join together with his wife Mel@@ ania .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the award winners &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with progressive TV @-@ series award winners &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Le@@ ar announced that it will already give to participation in the Gala . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New York Times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this presidency has decided to dis@@ close the arts and human rights , even to withdraw them even the means - and that charged me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 59 @-@ year @-@ old E@@ ste@@ fan stressed that she will use the conversation with Tr@@ ump in order to clear@@ er their vision .

we make the city food
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s Urban Buil@@ der , will go into R@@ ente next year .
the place is already written - suitable candidates are ra@@ r .
for 31 years , W@@ acker Urban Buil@@ der is founded .
and the work makes it still great fun as he convey@@ s in the press conference .
he reports varied but also challenging tasks that wait for his successor .
at the same time , please make sure that no application fulfil@@ s the profile profile .
the city is for the nearest possible time a architects or engineer .
thus - under the regard of the regular periods of employment - yet enough time to be el@@ aboration .
since Has@@ lach has been responsible for the administrative community as a sub @-@ association authority , candidates must refer to the applicants .
for this function wants to keep the city definitely .
if they are not able to fill out this , the citizen would have to go to Offen@@ burg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Caesar &apos;s the city and himself is important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says W@@ acker who reports a good operating member , as well as good mood between the authority and citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in more than 30 years of service , some important projects are accumulated on which the guard can look back with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are making life @-@ worth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure about the building office and its staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in the future there are varied projects on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a Are@@ as and the Dutch @-@ parking lot are targeted .
the chin @-@ up bridge between B@@ oll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , also the St@@ adi@@ on@@ tide is still topic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only the latter will be to be@@ ech around 1.5 million euros , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do it right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ acker &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; all in all , great tasks are waiting for my successor .
the work is fun . &quot;
design is present for a Stadt@@ bau@@ meister of large play@@ room .
with Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s @-@ own Bau@@ hof and G@@ ärt@@ ner@@ os can be flexi@@ bly re@@ acted on multiple ways .
&quot; one can move much , &quot; so W@@ acker , and the design of the green facilities will often be praised by citizens and visitors often .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since the old town stands as ensemble under monument protection , it is important to have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an eye to have it &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; if new buildings are approved , emphas@@ ises the schei@@ d &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; urban plann@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Stadt@@ bau@@ mer carries high responsibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is the builder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end everything runs here over my table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
assistance and coordination he can count on many long @-@ standing staff : Markus Neum@@ ai@@ er ( high construction ) has been in the case for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( underground construction ) for 15 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even that his successor is long wishes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &apos;re looking for someone who really want to identify and stay with the job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
continu@@ ity is not only important for a good operating li@@ ma , but also for the more design of the city .
whoever wants to inherit Roland W@@ acker should have completed his studies in the fields of Has@@ lach , as a graduate engineer or graduate architecture , and have good technical knowledge in the fields of construction and construction conditions .
the municipal office and construction of construction , building management , construction management , property management , municipal service department with building yard and urban gar@@ dener and sub @-@ legal authority , including monument protection .
bicycle on lines spread : southern distance locked
according to the police , the far unknown perpet@@ r@@ ator of the railway crossing in the Le@@ ob@@ ener road ( B@@ 116 ) had been thrown on the lines until now .
these were so bad@@ ly damaged , that the her@@ edit@@ ary freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go from two male offen@@ ders and have been searching for the night hours after them .
close to the facts , by witnesses a ros@@ ar@@ oter roller and a bike driver was observed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is far beyond a Laus@@ anno@@ y area , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ö@@ BB speaker Christoph Pos@@ ch to A@@ PA . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the or the perpet@@ rators had brought itself in great risk and end@@ anger traffic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
besides the damage at the Lo@@ k and the plant , as well as the late @-@ term transport and the costs for rail traffic , even P@@ ön@@ alen cannot come to the perpet@@ rators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , the spokes@@ man spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; significant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sum , &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damage were fixed at the Friday afternoon , rail traffic on the south @-@ stretch could be led without disabilities .
nearly ten person@@ alities were incur@@ red , two of which were interested in correspondence .
freight trains fell not , but they had del@@ ays .
according to the Ö@@ BB speaker Christoph Pos@@ ch , approximately 200 meters will be exchanged .
ins@@ ul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help , IB@@ D ( inflamm@@ atory formulation )
red meat and chocolate can sound for your digest@@ ive system like a night@@ mare .
but a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based protein and dairy products may cause symptoms of patients with inflamm@@ atory care diseases .
the incur@@ able condition that affects approximately 1.3 million in the United States and in the United Kingdom 300,000 , causes gast@@ ric acid and pal@@ sy , recur@@ ring or bloody di@@ ces , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
while the suffer@@ ers normally fall , flesh and dairy products found to avoid their symptoms , researchers at the Wash@@ ing@@ ton@@ er University found that the essential amino acid tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an of proteins who promote immune cells , who promote a toler@@ ant intest@@ ines .
the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Colonna , explained that immune cells in the gut pat@@ rol in order to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes , which is hidden in the food , do not enter the body .
cells that are capable of resol@@ ving inflamm@@ ation will be balanced by cells that promote the tolerance and protect the body without damage sensitive t@@ issues .
if the balance is too far in the direction of inflamm@@ ation , this can result a inflamm@@ atory intest@@ inal illness .
in experiments , it was established that a type of tolerance sub@@ cell in mice was pre@@ occupied by a certain bacter@@ ium in its inn@@ ards .
and the bacter@@ ium requires tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an - one of the blocks of protein - to resol@@ ve the appearance of the cells .
Professor Colonna said : &quot; we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us re@@ uter@@ i - that is a normal part of the intest@@ ine micro@@ bi@@ om , and the development of a population of cells that promote the tolerance .
the more tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an the mice in their food , the more they had the immune cells . &quot;
he proposed that the combination of L. re@@ uter@@ i and one to Tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ onic diet toler@@ ant diet toler@@ ant , less inflamm@@ atory intest@@ ines if the same system supports even in humans .
the post @-@ doctoral prizes in Dr. Lu@@ isa Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan explo@@ red a kind of immun@@ oh@@ ist@@ band when she found out that a group of study mice had such cells , but a different group of the same tribe , but he did not receive this .
they suspected that the difference with the intest@@ inal micro@@ bi@@ al of mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ us who usually live in the stomach intest@@ inal tract .
the mice were DNA @-@ sequ@@ enz@@ es and were found six types of bacter@@ ias , which were present in mice with the cells , but lack@@ ed in mice .
mice were moved in a ster@@ ile environment , so that they did not developed a intest@@ inal micro@@ bi@@ om and they did not developed this type of immune cells , and they received the L. re@@ uter@@ i and immune cells .
to understand how the bacteria results in the immune system , the researchers L. re@@ uter@@ i were increased in a liquid and carried out small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ri@@ pe immune cells that were isolated from mice .
the immune cells developed into the toler@@ ant @-@ growing cells .
when the active component has been cleaned out of fluid , it proved to be a minor product of the tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an metabolism , which is known as In@@ do@@ l @-@ 3 l@@ actic acid .
if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an in the feed of mice , the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent , but when the tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an@@ values were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan declared that people and the same toler@@ ant cells such as mice have , and that most of us L. re@@ uter@@ i in our stomach @-@ intest@@ inal tract .
it is not known if tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an @-@ side products from L. re@@ uter@@ i the cells in people so develop as with mice but defects in relation to tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an were found in humans with inflamm@@ atory represent@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote because these cells are inflamm@@ ation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a potential , high tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an@@ values in the presence of L. re@@ uter@@ i can lead to expanding this population . &quot;
Jose Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic has committed a &quot; gen@@ ius
in Manchester United with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic a &quot; Genius , &quot; Jose Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho believes , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der had his debut at S@@ amp@@ dor@@ ia on Wednesday evening .
with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , starting with a 2 : 1 win in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before Real Madrid starts on Tuesday , and impres@@ sing in the holder &apos;s role as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira after just ahead .
however , M@@ atic was excluded from the preparation for the preparation of the blu@@ es and only 45 minutes , what Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho only had to improve Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho , that it had to improve at the start of the Premier League season .
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a gen@@ ius in the way as he th@@ inks - he th@@ inks about football , &quot; said Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will help him earlier than later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to M@@ atic there are Victor Lin@@ del@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u in the Avi@@ va @-@ Stadium , as Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho his start @-@ XI for the beginning of the season .
the Independent revealed this week that Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho loved three other new commit@@ ments , but he in@@ si@@ sted that the club had made a &quot; fantastic work &quot; to meet three of its four pre @-@ ranking new commit@@ ments .
&quot; three out of four , thank you for the association , &quot; he added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they have four out of four , but they have given great trouble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing &apos;s &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky

the action took 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar screens the form of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole was a car@@ dio test for new engines .

new dr@@ au@@ ght for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
as the wind revol@@ ves around : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was the leader of the SPD , the social @-@ democratic Prime Minister always met with some concern in Berlin .
only have no distur@@ b@@ ance from the party centre , only there was no counter@@ part from the covenant - as the as the most important wish of the elec@@ toral struggle .
since Martin Schulz , the party has changed itself .
since then , the employees of the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus took advantage of the events in the SPD @-@ ruled state capit@@ als .
what Schulz takes place there since the beginning of the year , this time would not have been described in the approach .
there were deep advice .
one after another .
after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony the Federal Government CD@@ U looks a general signal against co@@ al@@ itions of the SPD and Green Party .
&quot; it shows once more : red @-@ Green can easily be reg@@ ressed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said CD@@ U @-@ General Peter Tau@@ ber &apos;s editor Network Deutschland ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the surprising fac@@ tions of a Green @-@ Represent@@ atives has over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .
five months before the Parliament election , his red @-@ green coalition lost their one @-@ vote majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Green Party Director Michael Kell@@ ner has asked to return the Angl@@ o @-@ Sax@@ on Green @-@ dep@@ uties El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets to return to their mandate .
the transfer to the CD@@ U means a clear de@@ formation of the elec@@ torate .
El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets must immediately return their mandate , &quot; said the Federal President and Election Network of the Gre@@ ens Network Deutschland ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this could not be as true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new Hi@@ ob@@ s@@ For@@ bidden were reached by the party centre in the morning of Friday morning . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Weil , SPD @-@ President of Lower Saxony , stands in accordance with the convic@@ tion of the green M@@ ust T@@ jack@@ ets to the CD@@ U without own government majority .
it is the provisional point of a whole series of large and small cr@@ ises in the SPD @-@ Landes@@ feder@@ ations .
and no one knows what comes next .
the mist@@ akes began with the un@@ exp@@ ec@@ tedly defeat at the Saarland election in March .
a blue eye , more not , s@@ oo@@ ed the com@@ ra@@ des of stone .
everything was otherwise stated after the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia .
it was then too - and everything was very worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into the deaf people , the Düsseldorf @-@ Ple@@ ite hau@@ te the party in smooth .
and then the com@@ ra@@ des were g@@ ushed out again in the weeks .
then when they had just turned into the courage , the G @-@ 20 summit of Hamburg came .
and with him the next rush came .
Mayor O@@ laf Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD Land@@ ef , lost its Nim@@ bus at that weekend , because he was in the elite harmon@@ ie while his town burned .
and because he went in the crisis communication so pretty everything was wrong , what you can do wrong .
since then Schol@@ z f@@ ights for political survival .
now Stephan Weil passed .
because of the VW @-@ exhaust gas and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Lower Saxony &apos;s Prime Minister has already been in criticism since a long time .
Mi@@ esis Um@@ fra@@ ctions came in addition .
nevertheless , or perhaps , because in the past few weeks , because , in the past few weeks , I tried to acc@@ entu@@ ate the covenant .
the aspir@@ ation of former mayor of Hanover , expanding its power in Berlin , remained not hidden in the field of Martin Schulz .
they let him grant him , as they understood as a stabil@@ ization of the party .
now the exact opposite could occur .
since then , because of the part@@ isan hospital , the Angl@@ o @-@ Sax@@ on Green is essentially not guilty .
and Schulz doesn &apos;t act at all .
and sometimes the com@@ ra@@ des are trying to hold your own series .
her wrath lies upon the Green Party , and here are all the back@@ sliding par@@ li@@ ament@@ arians in the west .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democracy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , head of the interests of all others &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , chief of the Par@@ part in the SPD &apos;s Bundestag &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Legal Network Deutschland ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ms. T@@ jack@@ ets has not been elected as Director of the Lower Saxony Green Party for its person as director of the Lower Saxony Green Party , so on .
the logical consequence would be that she returns to its mandate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , Chief of the SPD @-@ German Parliament , procla@@ im a &quot; un@@ democratic man@@ eu@@ ver . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for four years ago , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the voters made Stephan Weil to minister &apos;s prime minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who led the Lower Saxony as a nickn@@ ative candidate to the R@@ ND . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well , the personal career factors of a future CD@@ U dep@@ uties are the election result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Op@@ per@@ mann said on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he required to clari@@ fy the back@@ grounds .
I want to know whether more or more or more out@@ ages the CD@@ U Niedersachsen has given .
grant of the town center III
who wants to renov@@ ate his house in the years may get a coming support from the country .
in addition , Mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representatives of jet@@ ty city development on Wednesday received .
at the beginning of the information event Sch@@ in@@ dler had once again a look back to the previously mentioned .
since 1991 it has been active in rehabilitation areas .
then , in the renovation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the State of Baden @-@ Wu@@ ert@@ t@@ emberg have taken two thirds of the funding amount .
the grant from 2005 to 2016 was still 60 percent of the sub@@ sid@@ y .
for Sch@@ in@@ dler , the existing sanctions are a &quot; success project &quot; - it was finally important to promote the development of internal development , and not only new construction areas .
on April 4 I will receive the information from the governmental office in Karlsruhe that there will be a rehabilitation area III .
the total amount will amount to 8@@ 33 333 euro , of which 500 000 Euro were received from the country , the rest of the community .
how is a renovation area ?
you will continue to examine so Sch@@ in@@ dler further , where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are .
however , it also plays a role if in the planned area of all interested parties to be rehabil@@ it@@ ated .
if necessary , the area borders may also shift once again .
the Ste@@ g arrived on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; cellars presented the contents of the federal states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social City , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which frames would then be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
● The core of the program are the rev@@ ital@@ ization of internal cities , improving the residential and working conditions and extension of infrastructure .
the measures were object @-@ related , that is called per plot .
then the renovation area would then be defined as a statute .
the grant period for the funding period has been running from 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2017 .
however , until September of this year , however , only once the inventory may be carried out , within the framework of those involved parties involved a questionn@@ aire .
as of November or December , the set of movement should be carried out so as possible , in the coming year to be started with the sanctions .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann declared that each commune can conduct the bes@@ ity tests .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s therefore to evaluate the urban@@ ization abuse and decide when san@@ to and in which circum@@ ference is . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will then be entered for the respective plot as well as a re@@ loc@@ ation@@ er in the land register .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann would come again after this , and make itself a picture of the location , promised them .
Got@@ zel stressed , a major success factor for the project was the participation of those involved .
therefore it will be questionn@@ aires to be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled up until the end of the summer holidays .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the yellow questionn@@ aire is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; building and land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which proceeds among other things for the construction condition and the renovation views . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the gray survey , the &quot; household and housing , &quot; may be made to size , distribution and inhabitants of a living room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; operating bow &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is only complete if the premises are operated in the building . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , however , Got@@ zel noted that a full @-@ filled questionn@@ aire is not simultaneously based on funding .
besides new construction work is not eligible .
Sch@@ in@@ dler emphas@@ ized that the distribution of conveyor belts according to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wind @-@ dog principle &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works - who first comes first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you could make no funding for later &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to reserve &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; finally , photos of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Centre II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; project were shown in order to tackle the remedi@@ ation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fl@@ avo@@ red &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
British inventor uses a micro@@ chip to come with a hand movement in the house and car
a British inventor is the first in the country , equipped with a micro@@ chip , so that he can enter his office and can even start his car with a hand movement .
Steven North@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thum@@ bs and poin@@ ter , and now offers service for businesses and individuals who want to simpli@@ fy life with technology through its company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he has worked with Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , a ad@@ visory an@@ aes@@ thes@@ ia at the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , merged to ensure that the im@@ plant procedure is carried out according to medical standard .
the technology resem@@ bles a cats and dogs pro@@ found micro@@ chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
the company of Mr. North@@ am also wants to change the locks of houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , everything for a surcharge of £ 300 per lock .

the costs of the White House costs the tax@@ pay@@ er thousands
the decision of the White House , a n@@ avy @-@ helicopter to fly the South La@@ wn for an event , tax@@ pay@@ ers will cost tax@@ pay@@ ers to the TI@@ ME magazine for the last month , up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars .
the green white Sik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D known as Marine one when the president is on board , the heart of the event was held on 17 July in the White House with American construction programs .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice @-@ President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House , made a tour of all 50 states .
the helicopter designed by a yacht out of Ma@@ ine , a fire engine from Wisconsin and a forkli@@ ft truck issued in Connecticut .
the presence of the White House , demanded the presence of the helicopter in an frag@@ ment@@ ary Order or Fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on South La@@ wn , after the recordings of Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit which is responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just wanted to be aware of it , because there is an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the Commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event on his superior , the deputy marine om@@ man@@ de@@ ur for aviation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the message showed that the helicopter arrived at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning on the South La@@ wn for the event at 15 o &apos;clock and so long remained until the lawn is cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 in this evening .
note that if the departure from the white house should be delayed , due to the limitation of the service hours a second team would be needed for the return flight .
the original air@@ crew was during the helicopter during the helicopter , while the security personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time .
from the TI@@ ME on available recordings went not clear that ultimately , a second flight is required .
the H@@ atch Act prohib@@ its federal ownership to use state ownership for political purposes .
records show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 has asked if the event could viol@@ ate the appointment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a question that we had shown , whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch acts and we informed that this was not the case , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the commander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sounds if you are closed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the deputy commander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the event &quot; Made in America &quot; was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the H@@ atch Act .
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the president issued a violation of reform of health reform , which was underway in the Senate , and he prophesied the efforts to obey the government regulations .
the use of the airplane that is known as Marine one or Air Force One is , of polit@@ ically advant@@ ageous purposes , is hardly a new phenomenon .
pre@@ sidents are obliged to use them for the journey .
but your use only require a photo OP , is unusual .
Tr@@ ump was carried out in February an investigation into the presidential plane in front of his first campaign in Melbourne , Florida , tax@@ i@@ services , and his Twitter account is full of messages committed by the use of the Presidential certificate by its predecessor .
&quot; the White House is fascin@@ ated by the show &quot; Made In America &quot; - the products from all 50 states will be produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the representative office of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 occup@@ ations often lead training flights in the Washington and South La@@ wn area in order to cut off the US President in the White House with precise centi@@ meter .
when Tr@@ ump was at the G20 summit in Germany in early July , H@@ MX @-@ 1 led 58 exercises in the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event was counted during the training demand of the airline and the month , a civil servants said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hel@@ ik@@ op@@ ter units flew over 11 hours on this day for &quot; non @-@ presidential support commis@@ sions . &quot;
the White House said that the tax@@ pay@@ er have not been presented for any of the other re@@ pro@@ ps , which were presented at the event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man of Sik@@ or@@ sky said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company has not been involved in the helicopter to present the helicopter on South La@@ wn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 has no budget drawings for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to St@@ und@@ ent@@ ari@@ d of the US Defence Ministry for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D replacement for V@@ H @-@ 3D however amounts to 24.@@ 380 USD per flight .
records of the unit list the flight time of the airplane as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ anti@@ co in Virginia .
the White House argu@@ ed that the actual costs for the operation of the helicopter type are far below that rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ er is based on the basis of estimates for the refund of funds is highly dec@@ ep@@ tive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this estimates contain staff , maintenance , and many other hidden costs which are included in the annual means . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a RA@@ ND study from the year 2015 , the funds for Do@@ D does not include the personnel costs , but take into account the costs for fuel , maintenance and conclusion of contract .
at that time , the former spokes@@ man of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , the use of the helicopter to the event .
&quot; the idea is to present this week things , which will be produced in America , &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er .
&quot; and I know that Sik@@ or@@ sky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I go out that hundreds , if not even thousands of people depend on this .
and I think , like most Americans , we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment , so many Americans have been working ti@@ relessly .
of course , it is appropriate to emphas@@ ize the . &quot;
it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump was inter@@ ned with the helicopter , when he had his tour of South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire engine .
in the White House , Tr@@ ump to representatives of Sik@@ or@@ sky and Cher@@ ry with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know Sik@@ or@@ sky very well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the President , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have three of them . &quot; &quot; &quot;

it makes the currently active Fr@@ ench@@ man at the Chall@@ enger tournament in the Italian Bi@@ ella game , the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) play at the tournament in the Czech Liber@@ ec tournament in its first deployment in this season .

how To F@@ ate OMV in America
in late evening Donald Tr@@ ump did not work when he signed his signature under the law to the disappearance of sanctions against Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his act the law en@@ acted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Congress un@@ packed a few &quot; un@@ constitutional provisions &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the response from Moscow was so sharp as expected , and even Brussels was fo@@ aming against the US army .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after all , the draft proposal provides to pun@@ ish European companies , which help the Rus@@ sians to build gas pipe into the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to un@@ rest , since then investors the domestic OMV is co @-@ financed with other European companies the construction of Russian Ost@@ se@@ al@@ eit@@ ing Nord Stream 2 .
the thr@@ ott@@ oman is enormous .
nevertheless , it is too early for an assessment of consequences , so the official statement of the oil company .

roll back@@ wards : the town represents 46 kitchen staff
the town organis@@ es the K@@ ita lunch break again .
with fixed contact partners for the children and an assignment to the team .
in the urban kinder@@ garten the clock is turned back .
on 1 September , the city of Kre@@ feld takes over the food supply to the urban children &apos;s care facilities ( Kit@@ as ) again .
for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ ance , Deputy Head of the Youth Aid Office , this is a good news : &quot; we all have very pleased . &quot;
cooked continues except house : a C@@ ater@@ ina takes over this task and delivers fresh cooked ch@@ illed .
the city operates in the area of 46 children &apos;s holidays , in 44 a warm meal for lun@@ ch@@ time .
in the last year of the year , 2800 children were sitting at the tables , and the demand is growing steadily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , only children who are to be cared for by 45 lessons in the K@@ ita &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ ance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour supervision , if children until 14 o &apos;clock . &quot;
46 sub@@ divisions : from 1st September of kitchen service : they heating the delivered meals , supplement the meals , raw food and fruit , por@@ tion@@ ate the meal individually , give food out , cleaning and clean the kitchen .
&quot; the workers are assigned firmly to a K@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ ance .
the size - there are two groups , as well as si@@ ze@@ able institutions - decides about the hour circum@@ ference .
&quot; the kitchen hel@@ pers now belong to the K@@ ita team , &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ ance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much stronger than bound and it is easier to implement educational concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because it is also : healthy eating and cooking lessons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the children shall help the food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the direct connection of the cooking @-@ power to the team is really convenient .
also for the children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have a well @-@ known strength in the K@@ ita , a person familiar with them , and not constantly changing people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
continu@@ ity is important to children .
the pur@@ ge of the K@@ ita @-@ rooms - so far too is the challenge of the kitchen forces - will be settled by special cleaning staff .
this version - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has also been the charm of the kitchen performance , besides the quality improvement of the kitchen performance , which she brought out to the city as the most economic cost , i.e. it is from the press office .
and that even though 46 sub@@ time forces are newly set .
&quot; but these hours fall at around 750 persons in the educ@@ ating area even so strongly in weight , &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ er@@ ance .
Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women , says the U.@@ S .
elections can only be representative if all members of the society , including women who play a role , said the Chief of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
Nicholas Hay@@ s@@ om , am@@ ber director of the United Nations mission , said that hundreds of women in the Provin@@ ces are di@@ di@@ de in the provinces of can@@ di@@ ment . three women can@@ di@@ ment for the role of Vice President and more than 30 per cent of new registered voters are women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the role of women cannot be under@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
elections can only be truly prestigious and cre@@ dible , if women are un@@ restricted and involved in all parts of the election process .
elections for the provincial Council and the Presidential elections take place on April 5th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Taliban have released thre@@ ats against an option to decide on the transition from international host@@ ilities . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Hay@@ s@@ om said , a strong role for women will even more intensi@@ fy the democratic success of Afghanistan .
the Afghan independent Election Commission reported that 1.2 million women of all in all registered 3,6 million voters registered .

G@@ MB concern about investments in the Mc@@ Vit@@ ie factory in Glasgow
a union would like to make a trade union with the managers of the Bis@@ ku@@ it manufacturer Mc@@ Vit@@ ie on the long term commitment to production in Glasgow .
G@@ MB Scotland said that the company had silent over the future of investments by the T@@ oll@@ cross site .
more than 500 employees work in the plant , which is created next to other products Hob@@ no@@ bs and R@@ ich Tea K@@ ek@@ se .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ V@@ ities owner but@@ dis said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that employees and trade union representatives &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be the first to change if its activities would change . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a letter to the company &apos;s branch officer G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vit@@ ie &apos;s on , &quot; concerns to express that funding for the moderni@@ zation of production lines will not be driven forward . &quot;
G@@ MB @-@ Senior organizer Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; the fact that we can win no clari@@ fication about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross country , aff@@ ecting our members .
generations of families have worked here and the labour forces strongly focused on local community and the Greater Glasgow , a major pillar for de@@ cent employment in a field of high unemployment and social dis@@ advant@@ ageous .
therefore , under the perspective of work@@ stations , wage growth and pro@@ sper@@ ity , and in front of the background of Bre@@ x@@ it , increasing living costs and chronic production process , the eastern end of Glasgow ur@@ gently need a flor@@ ent production jump at Mc@@ Vit@@ ie .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokesperson from Pla@@ dis said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the branch manager at T@@ oll@@ cross only received a letter of G@@ MB Scotland , and the company will react directly after we estimate continuous commitment to employees and trade union representatives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two months ago we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some issues were discussed .
we discussed with the employees that we are like all the companies that are working in an extremely competitive and un@@ safe economic climate , our business regularly review - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years we invested more than 5 million pounds , particularly in production lines and operating improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we recognize the legacy of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production site and all its operations at its location , the staff and trade union representatives should be the first to be experienced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
did the PS@@ G war@@ ns Barcelona three years ago before N@@ ey@@ mar ?
the site of La League likes her interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti ber@@ eu@@ en
Paris Saint @-@ Germain will not leave after the persecution of N@@ ey@@ mar after having issued an offer of £ 189 million in order to destroy its open air clause , but they warned Barcelona in front of three years before the world war .
the sensational approach exceeded the transfer window in summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than the double of the previous brand , whereby Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United in the last season for 89 million pounds .
after the termination , N@@ ey@@ mar will become the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional athletes of the world . PS@@ G provides wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is mad about the way , such as N@@ ey@@ mar has en@@ forced its way back to outside , although a source in the proximity of the Catal@@ ans established that the club has always given its best to take care of it from Santos in 2013 to take care of him .
but the football world was warned of the PS@@ G president in front of these views three years ago ?
when Manchester City announced interest in Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for every club to sign one of the best players from PS@@ G .
&quot; I &apos;m not concerned knowing that if they touch one of our player , we will stand in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to sign one of our players with themselves , this will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona seems to have exceeded this line , whereby the Spanish club will express interest in the PS@@ G intermediate field player Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti .
PS@@ G clearly did that it would not allow it to travel to the International from Italy to travel under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by taking one of their price for N@@ ey@@ mar .

interview : &quot; Dom@@ estic Tab@@ les &quot; report from the Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Reg@@ ions of the Reg@@ ions &quot; report on the mis@@ use cases &quot; Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
that is author and histor@@ ian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the con@@ test@@ ation sc@@ andal at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ origin@@ ate continues to discussions .
Christian Weis@@ se , spokes@@ man for the reform movement &quot; We are church &quot; said after publication opposite the German Press Agency , he was expecting from former Reg@@ iment Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of emer@@ itus Benedi@@ ct XVI , an exc@@ use .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would serve the appearance of the Catholic Church very serve if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would push her deeper needs of their own sub@@ missions , or to express its wrong estim@@ ation of the processes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the Vatican Council , however , critic@@ ized that in the reporting of violence against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two different measures &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in regard to the attacks in Regensburg , no one make sure that it should be f@@ eit@@ ed and den@@ ying deeds &quot; handle that should be pen@@ alised and in the future , the author Lu@@ c@@ etta S@@ car@@ aff@@ ia , histor@@ ian and member of the national Italian Bio@@ eth@@ ics committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hab@@ its , the Catholic Church as a source of all evil experience , is already part of the everyday experience and prepar@@ es the public opinion that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes S@@ car@@ aff@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also princip@@ alities in Th@@ urn and Tax@@ is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said in the interview with Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; someone likes to get to the church and this is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fres@@ sen &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Moreover , they pointed out that in their youth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have been a normal ped@@ agog@@ ical agent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be a normal ped@@ agog@@ ical agent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be ready to be finished . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can find it un@@ fair , today set standards in earlier decades , because the world have changed .
in connection with the reports about the mis@@ use cases , pop@@ e @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger could often appear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; completely wrong , author and histor@@ ian Michael Hes@@ emann , who is translated with R@@ atz@@ inger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says E@@ emann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the reporting period . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what exactly is written in the 440 @-@ page report , which was presented by the dioc@@ ese of Regensburg and the En@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment lawyer Ulrich Weber ?
a total of 5@@ 47 reg@@ iment figures were captured between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s , &quot; High @-@ consistency victims &quot; victims of survivors , 67 Dom@@ spar@@ rows sexually ab@@ used .
in the final report it is a Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; summar@@ ize , so that by domain name R. in many cases forms physical and psychological violence were applied .
high E@@ moti@@ onal was able to drop the punishment for the pupils in the way .
nevertheless , contrary to numerous other accused , that many victims were estim@@ ating the general humanity of R. , and therefore , in numerous cases , even positive memories came with him . &quot;
the interview declared H@@ emann , why the final report about the dis@@ sent@@ encing sc@@ andal at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger cathedral in the opinion of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger of his opinion .
Mr. E@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the inci@@ dents of violent sei@@ zu@@ res in a protected area of military bases , gives a contra@@ dic@@ tory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a lift , many students take up his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the other , he also appears as chol@@ ester@@ ol and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , who , the ö@@ f@@ teren , was also produced no top performance when a domain name was musical .
how do you analyse this final report ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : if you read the trouble and read all the 440 pages long report from the front to the back , one must rather ask , why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is at all .
he is just eight pages dedicated , and he will be acquitted of all suspic@@ ion of medi@@ ator or agents in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the original texts of the school took place outside of the area of action .
you may am@@ end him if necessary , of which too late or first impression is not serious enough to have taken too late .
the high school high school , which he worked was practically all survey@@ ed as - so lit@@ eral - &quot; Rede@@ mption , &quot; &quot; Heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the wide majority of his student Georg R@@ atz@@ inger combines him as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warm &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as extremely stable teacher , who provided the guys regularly with cake , bis@@ cuits and bon@@ b@@ ons and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; always surrounded by gra@@ pe varieties &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
merely a minority worth about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and its high emot@@ ion , which led to W@@ ut@@ out@@ breaks even before .
that he did not only cast with chairs and cast the keys on the floor , but also whis@@ key to the hair of hair or ears , he has already deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and exc@@ it@@ ated himself .
it has to be hon@@ our@@ able , however , that such educational methods in the late period , 1960s and 1970s have been widely used , parents like teachers .
do you know any breeding methods ?
of course , I think everyone of us who was born in 1968 .
I have witn@@ essed this still in a se@@ ful school , a state gymn@@ asium .
compared with what it actually happened in this report , namely the indispensable sexual abuse and the awareness of the school , these are b@@ agu@@ ing Bag@@ at@@ ellen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then you &apos;re going to do not rather with his acquain@@ t@@ ance and his role as brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many media was falling upon him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Bavarian Pope , there are many who have never understood him still e@@ ager@@ ly .
but the truth is : the report from Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s report in every respect !
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the media was reported in connection with the report very much about the topic of mis@@ use in the reg@@ iment of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reg@@ ions &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in the final report , is there some processing or cont@@ acting with regard to sexual abuse during sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : very clearly no .
no one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have committed themselves to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were inaugurated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never tried myself to speak to my father or my mother , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a person representative for the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was very embar@@ rass@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real problem in the En@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment of Sex@@ ual abuse was , and is that most victims of swal@@ lowed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if they did not even parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then did not determin@@ es a ch@@ oral manager , who would have been a colleague of offen@@ ders .
how do the Dom@@ estic Tra@@ ders student of R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role played with regard to the abuse of abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a question@@ able student @-@ formulated this way : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he would have had happened ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) and could have list@@ ened to the respective perpet@@ rators .
I think it ... also for really ab@@ sur@@ d , to accept that as Bub@@ ble inv@@ ading or clear@@ er or rather opened , as opposed to their parents , inter@@ nat@@ s@@ conduc@@ tive , confidence teacher , etc .
that one speaks with him about sex ... - und@@ ou@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that in the ap@@ ron concerned , students and / or their environment could not be confirmed in the investigation of the study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is therefore free of charge from everyone to sexual abuse .
that may also be accused of accused him not prevented or brought him back to the ad .
hence , there is no reason to bring his good name to these contra@@ dic@@ tive crimes committed in some cases , as unfortunately it happened in some cases .
in the media was much of &quot; Gew@@ al@@ ur@@ z@@ essen &quot; to read the Reg@@ ions of Reg@@ ions .
in the report , the former domain name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is presented in the report .
do he have to live with this alleg@@ ation ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : this is the big problem that in the coverage it really miss and di@@ vin@@ ely , was taken from sexual abuse and awareness @-@ somewhere and somewhere in the middle of dr@@ in , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but just this is a mis@@ use of the report .
since it is clean : between the school and high school of Dom@@ spar@@ rows , between sexual abuse and awareness , we say , we say once more to rest .
Moreover , the report deals from the time since 1945 , i.e. from four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not ch@@ oral conductors of the cathedral @-@ atzen .
the whole aw@@ ful exam@@ ining woman , the cases , in which boys were sore pain@@ t@@ oned and mal@@ ign@@ ited , were all involved in the pre@@ school in Et@@ ter@@ zh@@ ausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where truly sc@@ andal@@ ous states have to be ruled out .
but with them , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he got the boys first to face when they were already at the high school high school .
on the same way , like the very most witnesses , the subject of &quot; Vor@@ schule &quot; chart . &quot;
one was just happy to be revealed and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; par@@ a@@ quar@@ ic &quot; states .
what was different at the high school ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : there was a discipline in Germany , but not there is no sa@@ dist@@ ic violence .
and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , at which the report conclu@@ de that &quot; many victims were estim@@ ating the general humanity of R. and therefore , in numerous cases , even positive memories came with him . &quot;
at most , the fo@@ al remains to have gone away .
yet in spite of all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states on the pre@@ school .
the first time in 1970 / 71 when he began to establish and started out of their predec@@ essors at a school where he was not working and responsible for , ( as the witness ) did not hear , and then again around 1993 .
closed Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in front of the states , consistently the ears ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the Director of the Dom@@ ost@@ at high school , which even produced the report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in it he indicates that the inspection was still pract@@ ised in the fore@@ front . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
already in view of the danger of negative press releases , it is inv@@ iting ur@@ gent .
that was , of course , as a legal clarity , was forbidden in Bavaria , as well as in Bavaria .
before that , they took place in a legal gray zone , just like everyone knows about us .
and it was difficult to estimate him hard for him , where the suffer@@ ers might ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated or dramatic , and where was not the allowed limit of the limit was exceeded .
they could not say , he would have gone away .
that is not true .
the test penalty was officially abolished in Bavaria in 1980 and was officially abolished in Bavaria .
princip@@ ality in Gloria von Th@@ urn and Tax@@ is , it was un@@ fair to address the present @-@ today educational standards to the time of time .
how do you see it ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : we histor@@ ically talking about the &quot; Fall@@ ac@@ ck of An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; which is the danger to vote for today &apos;s moral scales .
the princ@@ ess has in right now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but this does not apply for sexual abuse , who was ab@@ hor@@ red in all times and not for what was broken in the school of resi@@ sts and violence at exc@@ use of children , that goes beyond that time already beyond that time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is all very fear@@ ful and I &apos;m glad that it finally started .
but at the same time I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because all this had nothing to do with him .
its funds to the discipl@@ ines and punishment , so ear@@ ist@@ les and ears to go , were widespread in the 1970s .
when physical punishment was forbidden then , he has stri@@ pped himself immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what is the picture of his Reg@@ ions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because in the talks with you for the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
was this subject also discussed the language ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book , however , is about life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , tells his perspective , as the Dom@@ spar@@ rows played only one side .
nevertheless , I don &apos;t miss a way that he led there to a thor@@ ough reg@@ iment .
however , it must be said once again : without these perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without any un@@ conditional discipline , it would probably be possible to form an institution of world tran@@ scri@@ bing , true cultural heritage of Europe and his musical tradition that went on tour twice in the US ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with bis@@ cuits and bon@@ b@@ ons you do not make any great singer , and from any success , at which area , still discipline , passion and self @-@ break@@ age .
what kind of people you have experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger during talks to her book ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : I really learned about the work on the book and in addition I experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger and always experienced as wonderful , hum@@ orous , rich and heart@@ felt good people , from which one could not imagine that he could only do something to fly something .
I arrive regularly with , like many former Dom@@ origin@@ als today , 23 years after his retirement , regularly contact him to visit him , he is almost blind - and it is as a member of her family .
those who would not forgive him until today , that he was even strictly to them , are clearly in min@@ orities .
most Dom@@ origin@@ als are than@@ k@@ ful to him that he has enriched its life and brought the world of music about them .
and that he always had a good , v@@ ä@@ del@@ ight@@ ful teacher - a close father , sure that may be - but also a lov@@ able respec@@ t@@ sper@@ son , to whom they still see and honor them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and please , once again clearly : everything you have been proposed for him , educ@@ ating methods that were on the agenda at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we can be glad that we have long since overcome this time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is highly un@@ just , a man because it is promin@@ ently and a more prominent brother to make the media &apos; sin@@ ner &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is the evil intention behind it , just too obvious .
for the report that was just released , over@@ load it .
now it would have a 93 @-@ year old man who had acquired great mer@@ its , and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps , nobody would like to know the reg@@ iment of reg@@ iment in peace .
