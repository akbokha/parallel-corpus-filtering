<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four cards that change your view onto the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irren-Anstalt, where young people are to meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A pftkapelle, where is now undermined for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small gardeners migrate the lonely reason of peasants.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Münch supports exciting stories about days.</seg>
<seg id="6">There are nervous when maps are not current.</seg>
<seg id="7">This knows everyone who had to leave himself because the Auto-Navi took place a green meadow.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historic maps of the Digital Bayern-Atlanque, a tender offer by the Geoport in Bavaria, are all others as current - but just a very easy-to-circuit.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare it with current online-cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then, cities and municipalities in the area of Munich Mercury will have changed since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern Atlas is a flickduke that is not equal to such as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">The large map material were developed to cities and municipalities in more detailed cards, so-called Uranium, has been incorporated.</seg>
<seg id="13">These were produced according to the Bavarian Authority of Bavaria between 1810 and 1864 and skip the first survey of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army of the army occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">By Napoleon, Napoleon desired an overview of the occupied country and gave a topographic survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even if the French troops were finally pulled down to the peace of Lunéville, Feb. 9, 1801, there were today's neighbors who created the idea of a country-wide Bavaria-card.</seg>
<seg id="18">Kurfürst Max IV. Joseph drove the project forward, founded the "Topographic Bureau" - and thus the Bayerische Staatsoper Box.</seg>
<seg id="19">The prion paper for Munich dates back to 1856 and is like all others can be found on the Bavarian State Library.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of early / today is the case of the state capital on the most impressive.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">For example, undersendling, which is relatively isolated in the map of 1856, is still relatively isolated.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Sendling was born 21 years after the map, in 1877 as a Munich district.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today Untersendling is in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">In 1856 the houses are concentrated around 1856 along the Plinganserstraße, which only was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where the western park is, you can see nothing as fields - at first sight: in-zooming, a small-part map with dozens of lines and figures: handwriting marked out of the so-called "Urement" from which the basic tax was derived.</seg>
<seg id="27">There are no farmers there today - but small gardeners of the plant "Land in Sun."</seg>
<seg id="28">The large green area is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Theresienwiese, founded in the 19th century, was still a meadow and there was no concrete desert in the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="30">At the other side of the Isar, the historic map provides an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "in the prion sheet we read in the area of today's au-Haidhausen area" "" "by the hight" "" "or" "" "on the skies" "" "but also in big letters" "" "Irren Anstalt" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here on the outside of the Auerfield street, one had once affected people with madness.</seg>
<seg id="33">There was in 1858 / 59 the Munich district of Irrenanstalt "On the Auer Lüben."</seg>
<seg id="34">In 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden became the establishment of a psychiatrist who is associated with King Ludwig II in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"he was advanced for his time and ended the purchase of the so-called Irren."</seg>
<seg id="36">In addition, he has underneath the staff to apply violence against the occupants, "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Museum Haidhausen, who has worked for an exhibition with the Ward.</seg>
<seg id="37">It was first place for 280 patients and later was extended to 500 seats.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sometimes this capacity was not enough - the reason for construction of the circulated plant in hair in 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">Since 2006, the Isar-AMPER-Klinikum Munich-Ost is one of Germany's largest psychiatry.</seg>
<seg id="40">At the site of the former Auer Anstalt, young people are in the Munich Salesianum in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920, and turned him to a youth center with vocational training.</seg>
<seg id="42">West is the pitch of the TSV Munich East, east of the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "in 2015, the children's House" "" "Casa Don Bosco" "" "was built in architecologically rejection to the origin of the origin of the Irrenanstalt" "" "by bombing in the Second World War." ""</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "the Marienplatz" "" "the Marienplatz" "" "was recorded in 1856 as" "" "head square" "", "the merchants" "" "department name" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">A decisive change brought the Second World War even in the heart of Münch.</seg>
<seg id="46">The bombs of the Allies broke out many holes to the downtown in December 1944.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English Institute, small business houses and a greeting from the Middle Ages, once stood on the Marienhof, where these days are scheduled and on 5 April 2017 the groundbreaking ceremony will take place for the second S-Bahn line.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slider, the old Munich map can easily compare with the aerial photo of today - and to fill the hole on the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil Rights published travel documents for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "" "" "the National Association for Promotion of Farms has issued a warning for colored people who travel to Missouri." ""</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Guide for the State of Missouri who will come into force by August 28, 2017, calls for afro-American travelers, visitors and missourcans, as a series of fragmenting, racial incidents in the last time and here," says it in the opinion of the Group.</seg>
<seg id="53">A recent law of Missouri, which makes it difficult to win discrimination against discrimination, as well as the prosecution authorities of the state, implicate the group to release travel documents, the NAACP said.</seg>
<seg id="54">"you have injuries of the civil rights to pass through mankind.</seg>
<seg id="55">They will be put together because of their skin colour, they are defeated or killed, "said the president of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "we listen to complaints in such a frequency we have not heard." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group tasted emergencies as racist verses against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died under unquestionable circumstances in the beginning of the year, after he had no petrol more than the journey by the state of Missouri, and was accused of accused of crimes in custody.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also has a recent report by the Office of the Attorney General of Missouri, in which it is shown that black drivers are more common than white people in the state 75 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "the recommendation is that humans are aware and their families, friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri," "" "Chapel." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">"people must be ready to bring whether the deposits should bring, or the relatives have to know that they go through the state."</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri was in the year 2015 100 Hasselt, after the latest numbers from the Hassverbreak-report program of the FBI, which enables the state in relation to the number of injuries to the 16th place of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">Travel is also a reply to a new Missouri law that it would be more difficult to accuse a company for residential or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously published the American Civil Liberian Union (ACLU) travel agent in Texas and Arizona, following the immigration authorities to commit forwards, people due to immigration fraud, which will contribute to the extension of the ACLU for further breeding.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel documents are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but in recent days, stakeholders have put the measure as response to certain laws and trends within the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">Electric fence project is Elemental</seg>
<seg id="68">The Lierbach electric fence project is a success project and will be continued next year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Bundestagsmen Peter White and Kordula Kovac have abolished a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">Representatives of the family-Schwennmann family met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MEPs at the Formerging Court of the Schwendemann family.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann also granted insights into its operation in which he cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and as many young people and houses in five apartments.</seg>
<seg id="72">"" "" "" "Black Forest" "" "is for him the alternative way for the milk of his cows, so Schwennmann." ""</seg>
<seg id="73">A regional office is located on the table of the holidays.</seg>
<seg id="74">Since he is also the S HV-Chairman of Fischerbach, he called the Weightful Project as "Elemental Important."</seg>
<seg id="75">I can do not profit on derart steep surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="76">The green area is sufficient for much work, much shots with the brushcutter.</seg>
<seg id="77">"" "" "" "we have shown here with the terms and the topography," "" "said Schwennmann." ""</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003 he took over the elial operation and management of these without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if it lead no bio-operation.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "for mayor Thomas Schneider," "" "the Commune has recognized the importance of the" "" "Weidecaunts" "" "and is delighted about leader promotion." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">At the cost of 3000 to 4000 Euros per hectare the farmers would have to be supported.</seg>
<seg id="81">One hope that the stress of the land could still be gone out for a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the greatest treasure that we have, are the people who work in agriculture, and imagine thoughts, as they continue their operation," "" "says the mayor." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">The farmers are often in criticism</seg>
<seg id="84">In 2013, there were a total of 25 plots of eleven participants fenced in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="85">The disclosure area is thus 40 hectares, which may not be forged until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">The half of leader was funded by the total cost of 71 500 Euros, a quarter contributed by the municipality of Fischerbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Thus the farmers stayed 12 610 euros, they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of wheat fence.</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," explained Schwennmann.</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "Kordula Kovac stressed:" "" "you do not make a really good job without farmers and farmers." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="90">Also for Peter White stood there: "here are the best food produced here."</seg>
<seg id="91">The Regional Court (LPR) Baden-Wurttemberg enables the state support of francality.</seg>
<seg id="92">The aim is to maintain the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">Prerequisite is the presence of a donation written by LPR.</seg>
<seg id="94">In addition, the enclosed area should not be bad-pervable (hangar over 35 per cent) and must therefore be threatened with the loss of power.</seg>
<seg id="95">For the Fish-Foaunting project 2018, the application is currently running from eight participants with 24 pitches, which would like to build almost 16 kilometers of fence.</seg>
<seg id="96">The disclosure area corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated cost is more than 112 000 Euro.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more sacred?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes up the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans estimate the same as any other - therefore the carefully produced Saddam Hussein's place on the Firdos place in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of Trump-regime, knew what he did when he did an embolic battle with Jim Acosta from CNN about the suggestions for drastic limitation of legitimate immigration to the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">In order to stay fair, Miller did not handle the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boaters and Liberty Imitators would have been gelyngish when he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But it took their significance, and in particular the meaning that it was attributed to her when the famous poem of Emma found Lazarus, 17 years after the completion of the memorial, its base was added.</seg>
<seg id="105">When Miller Acosta complained: "I don't want to enter a full thing about history but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom, which enlightens the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem, which you refer to that later was added later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is objectively true, but how he formulated it itself, is not really a story.</seg>
<seg id="108">It's about the contemporary resonance of Lazarus, the only one, in which a state does not only invites to an old immigrants, but the poor of the poor: "your poor, your poor, and your poor masses, who seek to breathe free, / the afflicted waste of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">There never had a time in which the "elating refuse" was better to see on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller committed himself in literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Trumps in USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict due to its importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural debate: it is in fact a conflict around the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who deploy their words after her death on the basis - knew very good that they complete a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American Republicism, in an unused classical image depicting the feminism of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in its poem is the female figure no more abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And there is another name: mother of the exilant.</seg>
<seg id="116">The combination of the Gediver's combination with the painting is a brilliant feminist Coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And exactly like Lazarus the significance of the statue, the people wanted to change the people from the right wing as long as long.</seg>
<seg id="118">The big Schreier Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty was conserviced, but rather an early neo-condoms, that put the American flame into the converted world: "Lady Liberty continues.</seg>
<seg id="119">She is supposed to bear the torch of freedom of the United States in the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch should not shine in the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">Quite unusual is Limbaugh click here to something.</seg>
<seg id="122">The meaning of the statue is quite a matter of perception of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative inative of Lazarus was built in them to see how they saw from the exhausted, but hopeful people after long and often terrible trips on the ships of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is in the truest sense to see the world from perspective of people who seek refuge and have a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue says to them the words of hope and of the will, which they must hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And that's not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever want to know.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch shall not shine the way, but the hatred that is the only source of power to ignite.</seg>

<seg id="160">Block Kritique on Facebook: don't worry about a public office if you don't reduce the impact of voters.</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something from bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long until the newspapers struck him because of all, from the interior policy up to his political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He implied with criticism, safe.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not bring his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"" "for the year 1783 Washington said," "" "freedom of speech may be taken away - and, and mute, we will lead to the sheep." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="166">This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan who must work to be more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted their opinion on its official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberian Union claimed him this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">The Staff of the governor left the lawsuit as the friar, and the online-commentary was full of a counter-reaction with "Na, and?"</seg>
<seg id="170">"" "" "" "it's just Facebook" "", "many people said." ""</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important if it is a guy like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican Governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is astonishingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest consent of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is no reactionary hillhead.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a fixed hand on the guidance of his state and strict observance of the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">"" "he was also very sent to use Facebook as a primary energy to deactivate himself with its voters and playing his hairless head towards chemotherapy on his side." ""</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore, the blockage of persons coming on the side of the governor - which is a public forum, which will be officially designated as officially and of employees who are paid with public tax dollar - unnecessarily and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post defended Hogan spokesperson Amelia Chasse the acts of the governors and argued that the blockage of the comments was nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or chambers or water-filled people which force the whip online.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post spoke with some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are just real people who speak with their chosen leaders, a teacher, a businessman and a priest, no Trolle.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said that their comments are respectful, think and not profane.</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest said the Bible in his post office, and called his name to Hogans's Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, md., was not hassered but she asked to hate crimes.</seg>
<seg id="186">"" "" "" "I said that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news," "" "wrote in the commentary sector of the news" "" "The Post." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="188">"" "what the members of the governor as" "" "concentrated spam attack" "" "would call other likely" "" "intercession" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to convert a message by simply blocked a critic or deleted a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much more cleaners than in history if one had done the same, that employees were sent to collect newspapers with critical conductivity and be burned to silence and to silence.</seg>
<seg id="191">But exactly that happens now.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public officials, who criticises Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is complained by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question was last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County verted the First Amendment, according to the US District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she committed a voters from their Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Before (R) received a visit to ACLU for using Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">That should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">At the moment Washingtons had a similar effect like the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The number of newspapers multiply between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous postpens on his lead.</seg>

<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms to place one another, so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could be.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creative, to solve the award.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel plant is quite complicated," he explains.</seg>
<seg id="1332">"we had to arrange the rooms so arrange that they had to be stacked on each other, without having to decorate us.</seg>
<seg id="1333">It wasn't just to build a simple platform, but to put the steel so that it had the right height for the top or below. "</seg>

<seg id="1343">So special about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>

<seg id="1345">"" "" "" "it's not important to push the door, if you push the door, very easily" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1346">With the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne was able to gain additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the floor space - or how your property is estimated," says Erfan.</seg>
<seg id="1348">"" "" "" "in a sedimentary form a real estate broker shall occur and calculating a calculation based on the floor size." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2095">In addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the property, on which the farm market stands, in which 13 directors are marketing their products.</seg>
<seg id="2096">The construction work will be finished with the beginning of the construction work.</seg>

<seg id="2139">They even made a shot by Shoili Kanungo illustrated comic "Suppossomebody," which was foreseen a future when the President Chelate Judgment would not be able to see the exhibition personally.</seg>

<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based protein and dairy products may cause symptoms of patients with inflammatory care diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable condition that affects approximately 1.3 million in the United States and in the United Kingdom 300,000, causes gastric acid and palsy, recurring or bloody dices, weight loss and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While the sufferers normally fall, flesh and dairy products found to avoid their symptoms, researchers at the Washingtoner University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins who promote immune cells, who promote a tolerant intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells in the gut patrol in order to ensure that harmful microbes, which is hidden in the food, do not enter the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are capable of resolving inflammation will be balanced by cells that promote the tolerance and protect the body without damage sensitive tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation, this can result a inflammatory intestinal illness.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments, it was established that a type of tolerance subcell in mice was preoccupied by a certain bacterium in its innards.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the blocks of protein - to resolve the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - that is a normal part of the intestine microbiom, and the development of a population of cells that promote the tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan the mice in their food, the more they had the immune cells. "</seg>

<seg id="2592">The post-doctoral prizes in Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan explored a kind of immunohistband when she found out that a group of study mice had such cells, but a different group of the same tribe, but he did not receive this.</seg>
<seg id="2593">They suspected that the difference with the intestinal microbial of mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungus who usually live in the stomach intestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The mice were DNA-sequenzes and were found six types of bacterias, which were present in mice with the cells, but lacked in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were moved in a sterile environment, so that they did not developed a intestinal microbiom and they did not developed this type of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">To understand how the bacteria results in the immune system, the researchers L. reuteri were increased in a liquid and carried out small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells that were isolated from mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerant-growing cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component has been cleaned out of fluid, it proved to be a minor product of the tryptophan metabolism, which is known as Indol-3 lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">If the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of mice, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophanvalues were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan declared that people and the same tolerant cells such as mice have, and that most of us L. reuteri in our stomach-intestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known if tryptophan-side products from L. reuteri the cells in people so develop as with mice but defects in relation to tryptophan were found in humans with inflammatory representations.</seg>

<seg id="2902">"" "" "" "I must take Georg Ratzinger in protection," "" "says Eemann," "" "for all this had nothing to do with him," "" "he evaluates the results of the reporting period." ""</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is written in the 440-page report, which was presented by the diocese of Regensburg and the Enlightenment lawyer Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">A total of 547 regiment figures were captured between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s, "High-consistency victims" victims of survivors, 67 Domsparrows sexually abused.</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report it is a Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "summarize, so that by domain name R. in many cases forms physical and psychological violence were applied.</seg>

<seg id="2908">The interview declared Hemann, why the final report about the dissentencing scandal at the Regensburger cathedral in the opinion of Georg Ratzinger of his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr. Eemann, the 440-page report on the incidents of violent seizures in a protected area of military bases, gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2910">"" "for a lift, many students take up his" "" "humanity" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">For the other, he also appears as cholesterol and perfectionist, who, the öfteren, was also produced no top performance when a domain name was musical.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you analyse this final report?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if you read the trouble and read all the 440 pages long report from the front to the back, one must rather ask, why the name Georg Ratzinger is at all.</seg>
<seg id="2914">He is just eight pages dedicated, and he will be acquitted of all suspicion of mediator or agents in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The original texts of the school took place outside of the area of action.</seg>
<seg id="2916">You may amend him if necessary, of which too late or first impression is not serious enough to have taken too late.</seg>
<seg id="2917">The high school high school, which he worked was practically all surveyed as - so literal - "Redemption," "Heaven" and "better world."</seg>
<seg id="2918">"" "thus, the wide majority of his student Georg Ratzinger combines him as" "" "warm" "", "" "", "" "" "competent" "", "as extremely stable teacher, who provided the guys regularly with cake, biscuits and bonbons and" "" "always surrounded by grape varieties" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2919">Merely a minority worth about his perfectionism and its high emotion, which led to Wutoutbreaks even before.</seg>
<seg id="2920">That he did not only cast with chairs and cast the keys on the floor, but also whiskey to the hair of hair or ears, he has already deeply regretted and excitated himself.</seg>
<seg id="2921">It has to be honourable, however, that such educational methods in the late period, 1960s and 1970s have been widely used, parents like teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you know any breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think everyone of us who was born in 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I have witnessed this still in a seful school, a state gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared with what it actually happened in this report, namely the indispensable sexual abuse and the awareness of the school, these are baguing Bagatellen.</seg>
<seg id="2926">"" "" "" "then you're going to do not rather with his acquaintance and his role as brother of Benedict XVI, that many media was falling upon him." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2927">As the Bavarian Pope, there are many who have never understood him still eagerly.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report from Georg Ratzinger's report in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">"" "in the media was reported in connection with the report very much about the topic of misuse in the regiment of" "" "Regions" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger, in the final report, is there some processing or contacting with regard to sexual abuse during sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: very clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have committed themselves to the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were inaugurated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I never tried myself to speak to my father or my mother," "" "said a person representative for the others," "" "It was very embarrassing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">"" "" "" "the real problem in the Enlightenment of Sexual abuse was, and is that most victims of swallowed." ""</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they did not even parents and siblings, then did not determines a choral manager, who would have been a colleague of offenders.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domestic Traders student of Ratzinger's role played with regard to the abuse of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questionable student-formulated this way: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he would have had happened (Georg Ratzinger) and could have listened to the respective perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I think it... also for really absurd, to accept that as Bubble invading or clearer or rather opened, as opposed to their parents, internatsconductive, confidence teacher, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks with him about sex... - undoubar. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "thus the report comes to the very clear result:" "" "that in the apron concerned, students and / or their environment could not be confirmed in the investigation of the study." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">Therefore, Georg Ratzinger is therefore free of charge from everyone to sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2943">That may also be accused of accused him not prevented or brought him back to the ad.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Hence, there is no reason to bring his good name to these contradictive crimes committed in some cases, as unfortunately it happened in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">In the media was much of "Gewalurzessen" to read the Regions of Regions.</seg>
<seg id="2946">In the report, the former domain name Georg Ratzinger is presented in the report.</seg>
<seg id="2947">Do he have to live with this allegation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: this is the big problem that in the coverage it really miss and divinely, was taken from sexual abuse and awareness-somewhere and somewhere in the middle of drin, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But just this is a misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Since it is clean: between the school and high school of Domsparrows, between sexual abuse and awareness, we say, we say once more to rest.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Moreover, the report deals from the time since 1945, i.e. from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not choral conductors of the cathedral-atzen.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole awful examining woman, the cases, in which boys were sore paintoned and malignited, were all involved in the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where truly scandalous states have to be ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with them, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he got the boys first to face when they were already at the high school high school.</seg>
<seg id="2954">On the same way, like the very most witnesses, the subject of "Vorschule" chart. "</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was just happy to be revealed and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paraquaric" states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different at the high school?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there was a discipline in Germany, but not there is no sadistic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, at which the report conclude that "many victims were estimating the general humanity of R. and therefore, in numerous cases, even positive memories came with him."</seg>
<seg id="2959">At most, the foal remains to have gone away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">Yet in spite of all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states on the preschool.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71 when he began to establish and started out of their predecessors at a school where he was not working and responsible for, (as the witness) did not hear, and then again around 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Closed Georg Ratzinger in front of the states, consistently the ears?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the Director of the Domostat high school, which even produced the report.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "in it he indicates that the inspection was still practised in the forefront." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">Already in view of the danger of negative press releases, it is inviting urgent.</seg>
<seg id="2966">That was, of course, as a legal clarity, was forbidden in Bavaria, as well as in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that, they took place in a legal gray zone, just like everyone knows about us.</seg>
<seg id="2968">And it was difficult to estimate him hard for him, where the sufferers might exaggerated or dramatic, and where was not the allowed limit of the limit was exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">They could not say, he would have gone away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">That is not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The test penalty was officially abolished in Bavaria in 1980 and was officially abolished in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Principality in Gloria von Thurn and Taxis, it was unfair to address the present-today educational standards to the time of time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see it?</seg>
<seg id="2974">Michael Hesemann: we historically talking about the "Fallacck of Anachronism," which is the danger to vote for today's moral scales.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess has in right now.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"" "" "" "but this does not apply for sexual abuse, who was abhorred in all times and not for what was broken in the school of resists and violence at excuse of children, that goes beyond that time already beyond that time." ""</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all very fearful and I'm glad that it finally started.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I have to take Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Its funds to the disciplines and punishment, so earistles and ears to go, were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When physical punishment was forbidden then, he has stripped himself immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2981">"" "what is the picture of his Regions" "" "Georg Ratzinger," "" "because in the talks with you for the book" "" "My brother of the Pope" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2982">Was this subject also discussed the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book, however, is about life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI, tells his perspective, as the Domsparrows played only one side.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I don't miss a way that he led there to a thorough regiment.</seg>
<seg id="2985">However, it must be said once again: without these perfectionism, without any unconditional discipline, it would probably be possible to form an institution of world transcribing, true cultural heritage of Europe and his musical tradition that went on tour twice in the US (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With biscuits and bonbons you do not make any great singer, and from any success, at which area, still discipline, passion and self-breakage.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of people you have experienced Georg Ratzinger during talks to her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: I really learned about the work on the book and in addition I experienced Georg Ratzinger and always experienced as wonderful, humorous, rich and heartfelt good people, from which one could not imagine that he could only do something to fly something.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I arrive regularly with, like many former Domoriginals today, 23 years after his retirement, regularly contact him to visit him, he is almost blind - and it is as a member of her family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who would not forgive him until today, that he was even strictly to them, are clearly in minorities.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most Domoriginals are thankful to him that he has enriched its life and brought the world of music about them.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he always had a good, vädelightful teacher - a close father, sure that may be - but also a lovable respectsperson, to whom they still see and honor them.</seg>
<seg id="2993">"" "and please, once again clearly: everything you have been proposed for him, educating methods that were on the agenda at that time." ""</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have long since overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">"" "but it is highly unjust, a man because it is prominently and a more prominent brother to make the media 'sinner" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is the evil intention behind it, just too obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">For the report that was just released, overload it.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now it would have a 93-year old man who had acquired great merits, and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps, nobody would like to know the regiment of regiment in peace.</seg>
