Jennifer An@@ ist@@ on must not always be perfect or successful .
this has done impossible thing for the Hollywood star in an interview .
&quot; I will always be plug@@ ged in drawers or get from the exterior label which have a little bit more to do with me and the reality . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have the wish to be perfect and successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; hon@@ est@@ ly speaking , these things are more schn@@ u@@ ppe . &quot;
Jennifer An@@ ist@@ on ( 47 ) can only laugh that she is considered &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as they explained in the current &quot; Cos@@ mop@@ olitan . &quot;

gol@@ fer Lang@@ er receives the pyramid of stones
his experiences on the horse are over@@ looked .
Bernhard Lang@@ er , with some colleagues , visited the beach at the end of a golf course in South Africa with some colleagues .
a premiere for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden sports pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lang@@ er
after a few minutes , the horses remembered their inauguration , they hunt in the fast g@@ opp home to the feed .
a kilometre at this pace , I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; he says Lang@@ er .
and that the riding career ended again .
on Saturday , Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fers of all time - 101 tournament victories - again close to horses .
he would lead to his family over the plant of the AL@@ RV , on a horse , he doesn &apos;t want to go to photo .
the first time in Aachen was the first time at the CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German Sports Emergency relief provided the man from An@@ hausen in the framework of a small Gala of the pyramid .
there was no lack of awards in the sympath@@ etic sport@@ s@@ men .
Federal Cross Mountain , Silver District Lor@@ enz , Champions Tour @-@ Player of the year ...
even the British Queen has already pushed him .
long is the 18th lau@@ re@@ ates of the pyramid .
in Aachen he met the first award winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this distinction is very much , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lang@@ er , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for it is not only for spor@@ tive successes , but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lang@@ er has been supporting the offspring since decades .
and so he also gave the prize money of 25,000 euros .
with 15 other outstanding athletes , the two @-@ time U.S. Masters winner was recorded on Saturday in the &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of German Sports . &quot;
the awards are the athletes Hart@@ wig G@@ ien@@ ger , the Turner Eber@@ hard G@@ ien@@ ger , the F@@ ender Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ru@@ do@@ ka Frank Wien@@ ek@@ e , the j@@ umping of Al@@ win Sho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ thum@@ ously of the manus@@ crip@@ ts of Erhard .
many of these sporting events came to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , this lively company emigrated to the j@@ umping stadium , where Lav@@ azza Prize was running .
Bernhard Lang@@ er kept distance to the big animals .
Clin@@ ics and Tr@@ umps Economic Policy Compar@@ ison : it &apos;s all about the money
invest in infrastructure and prevent trade agreements T@@ TP - that want to be Clinton as well as tr@@ ump .
however , the two US presidential addresses are incur@@ red by the tax and energy policy as well as in a basic issue .
the differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and Hill@@ ary Clinton is a basic , more philosoph@@ ical difference .
he , about the role of the state .
tr@@ ump wants to keep in doubt rather small and war@@ n before , as the state of economy can harm - with tax and regulation .
Clinton establish the economy to death and regul@@ ate to death , he says .
he himself would be different , asser@@ ted Tr@@ ump .
he will return to regul@@ ate a sti@@ ff@@ icient tax reform , and is strong for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for businesses and businesses .
Clinton says , The state has given certain tasks to fulfil , he has dis@@ advant@@ ageous chances to open and needs money .
therefore , the tax would be increased for the rich &apos;s wealth , says it .
Inter@@ est@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic infrastructure .
Tr@@ ump and Clinton become almost identical in the committees , say Tr@@ ump and Clinton almost .
the democratic candidates is announ@@ cing the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programs in the infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are rejected by the state @-@ critical part @-@ wing of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
so on Tr@@ ump , we could still be part of internal discussions .
clearly visible are the differences in energy and climate policies .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal power plants and drive coal output in the U.S. again .
oil extraction is also expected to be possible in so far protected areas to announce the Paris@@ ian climate agreement .
Clinton intends to expand renewable energies with its investment program and calls : &quot; one country will make clean energies over clean energies and jobs . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be either China , Germany or America - I want to be there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but not only for infrastructure - even at international trade agreements , both competitors are not far away from each other .
T@@ PP , the Th@@ ine @-@ Pacific Trade Agre@@ ements , will not sign them to sign .
at the same time both the United States does not want to isol@@ ate international trade , but just safegu@@ ard American jobs .
that should then be paid better , about Clinton .
the current minimum wage of 7.@@ 25 US dollars is a hunger @-@ wage .
she wants to increase her 15 dollars per hour .
what Tr@@ ump in this question is to do is not quite clear : once again he says : the minimum wage must be down , then he says he will not be changed .
but the big discussion of the coming months is probably likely to develop the fiscal policy of both bearings .
on one side stands Tr@@ ump , which aims to boost the economy and citizens to boost growth .
his critics keep his critics , so that the bud@@ get@@ ary deficit would only be bigger .
on the other hand Clinton , who wants to ask at least of the rich men , wants to pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution .
escape : &quot; every poultry wife has experience with sexual violence &quot;
sexual violence belongs to women who flee alone , almost as early as everyday life .
if they arrive in Germany , they often are often traum@@ ati@@ zed .
a house offers refuge .
four women sit in a large kitchen .
each has a baby , that is at most a year old .
one has placed her very little son in the arm .
he gu@@ essed with big eyes curious in the room .
his mother cur@@ bs on the tab@@ let@@ op .
until it noticed that it is observed .
she sm@@ iles too short and cr@@ ush the little ones .
the scene works normal .
until you talk with Katrin B@@ ahr .
it is the Manager &apos;s Manager of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier of social support in Bavaria , and among other things , deals with the theme of women on the escape .
the four women in the kitchen are poultry farmers .
they live in the Munich North , one of the few de@@ centr@@ alized accommodations for all @-@ fle@@ dged women and their children in Bavaria .
in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs made establishment together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women &apos;s Aid .
un@@ long it was officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men are no - not as visitors .
the exception is a wax before the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every woman who comes in here has made experiences with sexual violence , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men will flee because of wars , because they are polit@@ ically prosec@@ uted because of them torture or death , because they send their families like the hope of Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in women , there are other reasons for the escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many shall steal secretly , because they do not see any other things . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in their home , they have experience with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , honor of honor , slavery , or forced pro@@ stitution .
that drives them away .
the run goes on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , a bottle for a bottle of water require sexual action , is no rarity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
those who believe it , soon as they ank@@ ets in Germany , ir@@ re , tells B@@ ahr .
too , there would also be women in refugee camps often as min@@ der@@ ous and worst if mis@@ used .
this means that approximately 90 percent of women , who live in the North of Munich , are sor@@ row@@ ed , estimates .
&quot; some of the children are not freely offered . &quot;
many women are so familiar , that they say nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they trusted not to speak openly about that which is too big &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they often do not help to help , there are more accommodation only for them , B@@ ahr .
the seven regional governments have been responsible for the placing of refugees in Bavaria .
on the question whether it is known from a similar project as in Munich in its authority area , answer some with no .
in the Ober@@ p@@ fal@@ z and Ober@@ fran@@ ken it is not so something to do in the governments of the governments .
also in weakness alone , poems are not accommodated separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , press secretary of the government .
in some shared floors , Unter@@ fran@@ k and Mittel@@ fran@@ ken , there are only two floors and their own houses only for women and their children .
the exception is Nieder@@ bay@@ ern , there are two central accommodation available exclusively for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also the committee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rights of women and gender equality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament are calling for women to be set up separately from men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a study published for the committee , it is said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important that men and women are separated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is missing the privacy or become women and women together , it may come to - for@@ mid@@ day violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
above all the shower room should be separated and easily accessible for women , stands in the study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how much women will feel the need of this protection , it is able to read the And@@ res &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; House in Munich &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; since then , we have talked to us , we have a long waiting list , &quot; says B@@ ahr .
you could easily make a second house .
assistant pet@@ als : recei@@ v@@ ables according to new labor action measures
representatives of the assist@@ ants have called up their union activities to appro@@ ve new workers for their disputes regarding a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has demanded its entire Council to appro@@ ve more labour measures from the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC said that it would have been the Minister regarding the concerns relating to the agreement .
in July , assist@@ ants and medical studies have voted on the re@@ jection of a contract that has been agreed with the BM@@ A .
he was rejected by 58 % of its members who voted in the elections .
in a letter to the members , which was published on Thursday evening on Twitter , the President of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government had remained quiet and had remained a problem that the agreement was denied .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; considering that , the J@@ DC Board voted to re@@ ject the proposed new contract completely re@@ ject and responsible for official new negotiations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Board has provided a formal application for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to appro@@ ve an ongoing programme of es@@ cal@@ ent working activities that starts at the beginning of September .
the disputes resulted in that Assist@@ enz@@ oll@@ ed came six times this year , the first overall inci@@ dents in the history of N@@ HS .
the leader of the BM@@ A assist@@ ants , Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana , came after the election to re@@ ject the agreed contractual conditions that had been recommended by the BM@@ A .
he shared BM@@ A members during the sessions held before the vote by 54@@ ,000 assist@@ ants and medical studies , with that the contract should be beneficial and supp@@ ressing .
following the vote , the health minister Jeremy Hunt said that the contract for doctors in England would be introduced in England .
Russia and Turkey : a &quot; Alliance of Foreign Affairs &quot; ?
it was a gest@@ ure that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to announce his hands and procla@@ im an official end of the eight months &quot; war of the words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin takes off his Turkish opponents in the gold @-@ plated hall of St. Petersburg Pal@@ ast@@ es in reception , I cannot accept one of the printer that Ankara wants to reconc@@ ile this reconciliation .
it was the hand@@ ler , yes .
but Putin &apos;s sm@@ iles worked as a mal@@ ign@@ ant and he radi@@ ated heat from himself , even for his re@@ use conditions .
on the other hand , Recep Tayyip Erd@@ og@@ an , on the other hand , spoke from his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report whole five times .
I could not count it anymore .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he promised also that relations with Russia should not only return to their old level before the crisis , but even further improved . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next day , a newspaper described that Erd@@ og@@ an would like something like that would never happen something worse .
his enthusiasm seemed to me to indicate the opposite .
but one of Putin &apos;s shining , sustainable bol@@ le showed that the Russian state of Russia had not forgotten anything .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first , which he mentioned in his introductory game : the shooting of a Russian fighter by Turkey on the Syrian border through Turkey .
Moscow reaction to the time was w@@ ut@@ ent@@ ated .
Putin shared and accused Ankara , Russia in the back .
this was even greater , because it was committed by a friend friend .
the wire back to re@@ build is hard , if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months , the state @-@ controlled media brought a fier@@ y , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
suddenly it seemed , when the Turks would bear the debt for everything .
the serious accus@@ ations of conduc@@ tive officials reported that Erd@@ og@@ an &apos;s own family had benef@@ ited from illegal oil trading in the regions of Syria , which shall be controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he fought this v@@ eh@@ ement .
but in St.@@ Petersburg , it was the official message that it was time to look forward .
finally , this meeting was just first took place because Putin received the debt of the President of Erd@@ og@@ an , who wanted to hear .
Russia was able to book a kind of victory .
for Ankara , the advantages of an arm@@ ist@@ ice are clear on the hand .
Erd@@ og@@ an needs all friends which he can get , after the last month in a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat almost his ministry .
repeated terror attacks on Turkey have also sh@@ aken him .
but there is economic moti@@ ves .
Russian sanctions met Turkey close - especially the prohibition of charter flights , which usually spend several million Russian tourists on the Turkish coast each year .
the number has declined by almost 90 % .
in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be facilit@@ ated if the flights will be resumed .
they are count on a late seasonal harvest of the Mediterranean .
this week the State TV predicted cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports will be allowed again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ st@@ i formulated this way : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists are there long , tomatoes together here &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is located in the West as it is the response to the tried power of power when he tried to over@@ take power .
to this , the lasting Gro@@ ll on the negotiations for accession to the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the inv@@ ent is to take advantage of the cool mood and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Russian state of State won a bonus in Ankara with security for ensuring that he requested &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; é@@ tat &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; é@@ tat for the selected state organs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a matter of Moscow to do a self @-@ understanding that has changed even a deep@@ est fear of rain .
the summit in this glorious palace that allowed Russia and Turkey , one , as it described me an analy@@ st once , &quot; two countries re@@ ject and feel po@@ or@@ ly and feel bad .
nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still large differences between the two still .
the largest difference is Syria , where Moscow has recently delivered the role as pe@@ ac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey would support each other side .
it could be noted that after almost three hours of first discussions both pre@@ sidents spoke at the press conference , that they could not even have stri@@ ped .
the president of Turkey prevented it to answer a question about their differences while Putin decided to emphas@@ ise this .
there is no clear con@@ sen@@ sus about it , where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of an open host@@ ilities - and given the potential for a perfect dis@@ aster than NATO member Turkey shot the Russian mar@@ tial jet - it is certainly better to talk to the two heads of state .
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside of Scotland are not available
according to the Board of Directors , the R@@ BS brand will only be reduced to a back@@ end role according to the Board of Directors .
Royal Bank of Scotland will not be available for customers outside of Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan sent to BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand joined the Bank &apos;s global amb@@ itions .
the bank has since been dist@@ illed since then , when they had almost collap@@ sed and saved eight years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at this time , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ BS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; brand have used to protect other end consumer products . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you supported the international sport with millions of Po@@ unds on sponsor@@ ing , from the Six Nations Rug@@ by to the Wimbledon winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now she has decided to press more national stamps in focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available for customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales , all RS@@ B testim@@ oni@@ als , the de@@ centr@@ alised headquarters and stock exchange at Nat@@ west .
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand will already be used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are others , smaller brands for private customer business that will receive more significance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Drum@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s military bank .
Mc@@ E@@ WA@@ N was inter@@ viewed during a visit to customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Sh@@ ire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the RS@@ B brand will become one of our investor and the brand , among which our employees will employ more to become a bank of stamps &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global stamp .
I say now that we are not pursu@@ ing global goals , but local targets .
each of these brands will be entirely different in their own municipalities for something different and our employees are working among those brands with the customer .
R@@ BS has already said that there will no longer be continuing its Six Nations Spon@@ sor@@ ing , and will increase the perc@@ ep@@ ti@@ bility of the various brands in his Sport Spon@@ sor@@ ship .
&quot; it &apos;s time for us to develop the bank of brands , because we are in the interior ( we asked us to do this to a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the chief of the board . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been very cy@@ n@@ ical before three years ago when we had said that we will be a great bank for our customers and launched these brands .
but with our work , focus on customer &apos;s needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes .
we can launch this brands again , so I think that time has come .

Russia &apos;s Putin hum@@ id Chief of Staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin was un@@ wanted to release his Chief of Staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov in like manner .
Ivan@@ ov was a lot of years part of the most found confidenti@@ ality of Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed as a special service for environmental and transportation services .
in a statement by the Kre@@ m@@ lin it reads that Putin have ordered his duties as chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration . &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who had joined Ivan@@ ov@@ s since 2012 , was appointed to his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
born in Tallinn in Tallinn , Germany , in 1972 , he graduated from the renowned State Department of Moscow for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) at the renowned State of Moscow .
at the website of the Kre@@ m@@ lin it is ( in Russian ) that he later became the Chief Executive Officer and St@@ abs@@ eil manager of the government fees .
on his appointment he said to Putin : &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activities as a state of state and controls to implement your instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Putin shared on the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov asked for this to leave his post and have recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
are the ri@@ di@@ ous faces ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious tur@@ ni@@ ches .
Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov has been a long time of the most close confidence of Vladimir Putin and works as he was working for the Soviet secret service , K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff he was one of the most powerful men of the country .
at a meeting with President Putin , broadcast on television , both men had claimed that the Chief of Staff came back on his own request .
but despite the weak@@ ening for cameras , only few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
so here is the result of a sort of power ?
nobody knows that .
but the official asser@@ tion - that a man who once wanted to comm@@ ended as an potential president again , I would like to lead to Russian environmental policy - joined big sc@@ ep@@ ti@@ c@@ ism .
in his remarks on Putin , which will be cited on the website of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , said Ivan@@ ov , &quot; that I asked you at the beginning of 2012 in an interview , I could tell me that very complicated - one could rely over four years .
as it turned out , I &apos;ve been chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months .
Ivan@@ ov recorded the post in December 2011 .
before he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .

Que@@ ens@@ a Cross@@ ing : connected to Fi@@ fe Bridge
the £ 1.@@ 35 bn project will be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the northern deck of the Que@@ ens@@ land cross with Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - what means that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first turning point of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; covers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which is the completion of the construction of each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge cutting of Fi@@ fe is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons .
it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 shafts .
the £ 1.@@ 35 bn project will be completed by May 2017 .
Minister of Economic Affairs K@@ eit@@ h Brown visited the construction site today a visit and was one of the first to go out from the country to the bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is a historical and symbolic moment in the construction of the river Que@@ ens@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all the witnesses of a engineering manship of a truly ep@@ ic measure in this project with more than 30.000 ton of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the wire between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a hei@@ k@@ le activity , which require extremely precise tolerances for the fit .
all in all , almost 79 % of the total bri@@ dging in their place and the last section of the de@@ cks gets to the deck today in Ros@@ y@@ th , which means that the deck is ready to be lifted to its square on the bridge .
Michael Martin , project leader of For@@ th Cross@@ ing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; the first closure represents a considerable milestone in each bridge project .
with this fantastic project , the clasp is looking forward to tr@@ end@@ setting and deep structure .
after installation of the last stre@@ ak @-@ section and its connection with the Northern Nord@@ tur@@ m@@ deck , we had to close the gap to the north or the north side .
this was achieved by pulling the northern edge of 700 millimeters south .
this was a massive and very hot activity .
massi@@ vely , as the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct 222 meters long , weighs approx . 6,000 tons and a gra@@ dient of approx . 3 % has to be moved up .
the tolerances that works on the team was tiny - at each side they were only a few millimeters .
lu@@ ck@@ ily everything ran very well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sal@@ vation in the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay : three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good luck in life &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luck to be alive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after they were cast out of their fishing boat to Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e R@@ N@@ LI li@@ fe@@ jacket beat on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T alarm , after a crew observed the event in Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay .
the three men had difficulties to swim in safety , while their boat went on moving into their own strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw the boat in its proximity to turn around , and introduced us the worst , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the head of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately , the strong wind b@@ lows the boat already beside their range , until we left water , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were res@@ cu@@ ed by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhau@@ sted at the age of 60 and was found on a bo@@ ard@@ ly without li@@ fe@@ jacket .
they all arrived on board of coastal site and were returned to rescue operations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Jones said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three men , whom were cast into the water , are lucky enough and to be alive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the boat engine had a not@@ ation , however , when the Bo@@ ots of the Bo@@ ots are lo@@ osed from the person who controlled the boat .
someone made eight over these men .
seriously injured - man st@@ aves to his ex @-@ friend
a man attacked his ex @-@ gir@@ l@@ friend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and bad@@ ly injured .
as the police triggered yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had given the key to get his personal things .
instead of the alcoholic offen@@ ders leaving the clothes of his ex @-@ gir@@ l@@ friend .
when these were come into the apartment , he set up twice upon them .
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured in the hand and the body .
the police could determine the perpet@@ rators .
during the 50 @-@ year @-@ old the ra@@ iment of his ex @-@ gir@@ l@@ friend , he called his mother .
this al@@ ar@@ arm@@ oured him his sister .
together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm their brother .
but she could not move him to leave the apartment .
therefore she went with their partner from the house .
on the road they met the Former lifetime of the husband .
when the two women &apos;s once again advanced the 50 @-@ year @-@ old his sister on side and handle his ex @-@ friend .
who builds Braun@@ schwei@@ ger cheap apartments ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and Green said to my : investors have to be much stronger in future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how did you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1,300 apartments in the next few years ?
the SPD proposes the next meeting of the &quot; manual concept living &quot; in the next meeting .
yet battle is programmed .
is the first line about the question : who is supposed to build the favorable flats ?
one rule is missing so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD faction leader Christoph Brat@@ mann writes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are able to build us with the Gre@@ ens : who wants to build urban areas in future 20 percent of all apartments as welfare apartments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the favourable dwellings may also arise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the big dispute in the city hall should be , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how do you want to build with investors , who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build investors at least 10 percent , but as possible 20 percent of the apartments as a social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new home building programme , which will cost millions , and will not be financed for inc@@ en@@ tives .
the problem , such a viol@@ mann : &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fra@@ ctions . &quot;
the CD@@ U would like to make investors as few regulations as possible .
the lens wants the hardness levels for investors .
regardless of his , Fr@@ ying , char@@ tered a deteri@@ oration of the situation on the housing market .
will the action plan implemented , that will ensure additional tasks in the administration administration .
more staff is needed .
it is un@@ clear whether we will get the specialists .
but the programme is not completely totally : because the approximately 1260 new apartments that should be built @-@ in .
but how do you compare the loss of more about 1,300 apartments , whose promotion is going to run in the next few years ?
by 2020 , there will be 500 apartments .
to avoid this , then the plan@@ atory spokes@@ woman Nicole Palm , should now be purchased from the city now .
Moreover , it would have to be thought about it again , to pick up apartments again into the price .
this is possible in the West@@ stadt .
the problem can solve the problem .
because in the West@@ stadt continue to run at the end of the year at the end of the year .
around 1800 apartments could go back into the price binding for convenient apartments .
only : this will not want to use the owners , housing units .
because the number of social dwellings in the West city will again be dra@@ stically lifted , from the goal of the so @-@ called mixture .
a concentration of social weak in only few neighbour@@ hoods should not give it more .
the Green Party anticip@@ ate that it will still be movement in discussion .
Group president Holger Her@@ lit@@ ch@@ ke writes : &quot; for a wide majority , CD@@ U must be with the boat . &quot;
the fact is concentrated on more buildings for family homes .
but what does not mean that a compromise is not yet found .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness , worth it
it &apos;s in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ing to see how the world changes .
that te@@ ens and child to play no longer go outside , but rather would prefer to spend their leisure time to spend on screens , was compl@@ ained in the last decade of many .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at Pok@@ em@@ on Go to get people from the sofa to get active and active . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the time on screen was initially limited to television , then on video games and last to smartphones .
therefore it &apos;s great to see that technology and activities are un@@ il@@ ater@@ ally exclu@@ de in the open air .
I &apos;m interested in the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that is based on the characteristics which initially created for the video games in the 1990s ( later created a cartoon series , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs ) .
how many phenomena of pop culture decreased slightly ahead of the release of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand in early July .
in other countries , the market launch was post@@ pon@@ ed by massive demand , over@@ load the server .
within a few days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go has more users as an inks and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , players with their smart phones after outside and search for Pok@@ é@@ m@@ ons that are following with a GPS and once they were found once again , &quot; photograph@@ ed &quot; ( about a screenshot on the phone ) or &quot; taken . &quot;
one generation that played the game when she was still younger , joined the tap and j@@ ump@@ ed to the search of the sofa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the USA the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; average &quot; person will return every day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cardi@@ ac , an app for Apple Watch , followed by the Washington Post recently with that within two days after launch of the game , the number of persecuted people who j@@ ump@@ ed every day 30 minutes , j@@ ump@@ ed from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company doesn &apos;t know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it merely look for the performance improvement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many public educational campaigns to take care of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 30 minutes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take part of the sofa &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be active each day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every day actively &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be deaf &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because many public messages are bor@@ ing to health and to come from people who look back . &quot; &quot; &quot;
yet , the importance of sport not to be assessed .
those who drives regularly , reduces its chances to developing cancer or depression .
physical activity helps with weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of advantages to bring them here .
but the miracle of Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that people bring a thing to do something in the open thing that fun is fun .
thus , three pillars of health covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine , as well as fun .
some people close the hunt even new friends .
as always there are m@@ ec@@ ologically game origin@@ ality , which must always be har@@ der over something .
and yes , someone could run against a door .
what should it be ?
it has a breakthrough .
even if smartphone apps had previously been able to track our activity earlier than Fit@@ bit , they gave us no reason to do sports , as it does this game .
new will lose his appeal and the use will be followed by time .
however , due to the Pok@@ em@@ on success , there will be more Games to be able to trans@@ form apps and virtual reality with the activity in the real world , and will be able to help many people on the hunt , active , f@@ itter and heal@@ th@@ ier .

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in Dam@@ s@@ ur@@ ns
forget the print .
forget the h@@ ype .
Simone Bil@@ es is on all the immune system .
dynamic on the ski @-@ horse .
effort@@ lessly on the beam .
stunning on the ground .
brilliant in all the line .
and now the Olympics .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American Tur@@ ner@@ in er@@ kl@@ ó@@ m on Thursday to the world compet@@ ion and enlarged the gap between the eyes and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spot@@ light of the Olympic Games .
its overall score of 6@@ 2,@@ 198 was clearly ahead of the silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; World team ran@@ adin A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze medal in Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
the Americans Simone Bil@@ es tur@@ neth to the Schwe@@ chat during the Olympics during the Olympic Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American woman who wins a multi @-@ campaign title and a total of the fifth , while she prof@@ ane their reputation , the best of their generation or even at all .
they broke in tears , when her end result was shown and her long journey was found at this moment an end .
this success presents it in the same division like a unique athl@@ ete , like Michael Ph@@ el@@ ps , who brought their sports activities to new heights :
Bil@@ es dominated the last three years , 15 world medal - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary L@@ ou finds her , &quot; she &apos;ve ever seen &quot; the best gymn@@ ast , which I ever seen . &quot;
it was expecting a final examination in Brazil , a contest , which went not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather much between her and a burden of over@@ sized expectations .
not return with hand@@ ful Gold back to the family in Spring , Texas would be considered a dis@@ appointment .
the Americans Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ ced , after they have won gold and silver in detail at the Olympic Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday , Thursday .
it took the first medal at Tuesday , while she was on the f@@ arewell party of the Team coordinator Martha Kar@@ ol@@ yi was served as Aus@@ ru@@ bas@@ al .
although Bil@@ es in@@ si@@ sted , during their long way@@ marks on the top , never the future is planned , that &apos;s not really true .
part of her floor exercises - which contain their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is voted in Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside of the Olympic arena in Rio .
it is not a co@@ incidence .
this girl who adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child was adopted and was discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans Mutter during a school trip to the gym , in which Bo@@ or@@ man was trained .
since the summer of 2013 , she has lost no multi @-@ campaign competition , a winning stre@@ ak , which will hold as long as it wishes .
even if Model af@@ ina was made easy using two fil@@ ming , the painting distinctive .
p@@ ig bal@@ let and bo@@ ar@@ ur@@ ns - in which bil@@ es hold the world title - lau@@ d .
she stopped again with 15,@@ 433 on the p@@ ig @-@ bal@@ let again - and set it on a 15.@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor .
Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ ced them gently as they expected her end @-@ to @-@ hand - a pure mol@@ ality - and tears exu@@ de in Bil@@ g@@ gloss red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision described it once in their collecting book .
the performance Ra@@ is@@ mans was a reven@@ ge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal went to a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke in Model af@@ ina .
this time had the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team capit@@ als , which is called by the Americans &quot; O@@ ma , &quot; a ledge .
after her soil practices , she cast down the audience in possession of a com@@ eback , which sometimes ar@@ du@@ ously appeared .
what it concerns , so the fast @-@ wide T@@ we@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ old has a very new meaning :
police : 3 victims in a mur@@ der@@ ation when listening in the car
according to police reports that were published on Thursday , two women and a 12 year old girl killed , who have lost in one of the deadly attacks in a decade in the first nuclear accident of Phoenix , while they convers@@ ed in the car and heard music .
Angela Rochelle Liner , Stefanie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah was shot on 12 June , while the car was par@@ ked in a drive , the authorities told .
the offen@@ ders fired eight shots from a hand fire@@ arm while sitting on the passenger side of the car , and then fled with another car , is in the report .
the police declared that the triple murder would not have been the result of a rob@@ bed , since the attack@@ ers took not the hand @-@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 , who took possession of an adult victims .
the Poli@@ ze@@ is@@ pre@@ cher of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard told the investigation of the investigation into the investigation , a closer look at it , whether it is linked to four previous attacks .
altogether there were seven injured in nine attacks in nine months , and two others were injured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this happens in a residential neighborhood in front of a house , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Howard der K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , in the beginning of the month . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is assumed that the susp@@ ects has several vehicles , including one brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to reveal the evidence that they have linked to the conclusion that the attacks are linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hosp@@ ital@@ ized due to their injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on site .
a witness divided by the police , that it was not unusual for them to sit in a clin@@ ched car to sit and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report on the shooting , which was assumed an empty pickup truck a half hour before the triple murder and was assumed that it was the work of the series .
investig@@ ators found Pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ausen and made a ball out of the seat and ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ y : &quot; it is better &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old , Edmund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to love the singing , toys and naturally his mother .
but as the least of his aging , Edmund micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ y , the result of a genetic disorder , knew about his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to during their pregnancy .
when he came home for the first time , my first thought , I create it not .
I do not create this .
I didn &apos;t let me leave .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what does not agree with it -- of course , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband , Vincent and her husband , revealed that Edmund &apos;ll never realize them under circumstances that he may not survive .
some doctors also went so far that they proposed to promote him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t know my first answer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t know that people still do &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Edmund can run with help of a walk .
Edmund could neither sit cra@@ w@@ ling up to his third year of life , and he can still speak .
but he makes slowly progress .
he can run with assistance and cycling .
he loves it to play and sing with his two brothers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elizabeth is the drawing language that Edmund for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Please sing me something ahead &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we bring to him character language , &quot; told Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News .
but it is not a typical message language -- &quot; she says . Edmund has invented some signs alone .
Micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ y has a multitude of causes : genetic as well as Edmund and infections with viruses such as Mas@@ ern or the Z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus during pregnancy .
symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly .
it is still too early to tell , how to influence the life of the Z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to reminds on the emotional award of a certain future .
I asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and they still know not .
I &apos;ve been asked for long time more after the progn@@ osis because I didn &apos;t expect it can really say to me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful rating for mothers of mamm@@ al with birth damage caused by the Z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus .
it will get better .
they know that it will be better for you .
they will love your child and love your child will love you .
severe ra@@ ids , floo@@ ding there in Louis@@ iana , Mississippi
severe ra@@ ids and large floo@@ ding in Louis@@ iana , to call on Friday the emergency , it will be counted all Saturday above all over the world .
numerous rivers in the southeast of Louis@@ i@@ anas and the south of the E@@ pp@@ is floo@@ ded their sho@@ res and threatened with severe floo@@ ding , the National Weather Service .
the Governor of Louis@@ iana accompanied by John Bel Edwards in contact with local authorities and assistance to the congregations concerned .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emergency Prepar@@ edness , the governor , divided the requests for flood vehicles , boats and sand bags .
Ste@@ ele said that alone , the municipality Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa was requested ten thousand sand@@ bags .
a floo@@ ding system is used over long parts in the South Louis@@ i@@ anas up to Saturday .
the weather service makes an estimated that additional 3 to 5 inches could be rain in this area .
in the South of Alab@@ amas on Friday a Fl@@ ut@@ bi@@ war@@ n system was used , while it was still standing in the area of Mobile .
the Com@@ ite river near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ ite in the vicinity Den@@ ham Springs , which both are located in Louis@@ iana , are reaching a record level after the weekend .
the Met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k Kr@@ aut@@ mann says that both rivers could restri@@ ct many buildings to the forests near Bat@@ on Rouge .
he said also that a down@@ ward @-@ down@@ ward @-@ floo@@ ding in A@@ scen@@ sion Par@@ ish is a danger , since these are slowly flowing into the Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as .
the river Ar@@ fa@@ w , south of the Mississippi State border in Liverpool , Louis@@ iana , was already recorded at the highest booth at 09.00 on Friday .
rescue ste@@ ams still lost people from the flood water in the districts of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ k@@ inson in the southwest of Mississippi .
L@@ ero@@ y H@@ ans@@ ford , his wife and his st@@ ep@@ son were among those who were saved on Friday in the vicinity of Glo@@ ster .
H@@ ans@@ ford , 62 , says the water of Be@@ aver Creek , which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house , more than night .
he said that a further st@@ ep@@ son who dwells near dwells , had warned him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are asc@@ ending and poured out the water and sh@@ amed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ ans@@ ford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my wa@@ ist .
his wife said H@@ ans@@ ford that she lived there in the 48 years where she lived there , never had ever seen such a flood of the river .
H@@ ans@@ ford said that he and his family members had all disabilities and he was the only one who can swim .
H@@ ans@@ ford told that No@@ thel@@ fer had saved all three in a large military truck and had brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were up to Friday .
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the flood had spread rapidly , since there were heavy rainfall , and that the authorities evacu@@ ation emergency transfers .
according to Kr@@ aut@@ mann an ob@@ server ob@@ sc@@ ured in the vicinity of Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13,@@ 75 inches of rain .
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the floor has been a significant effect on Wednesday since Wednesday .
the authorities made that heavy ra@@ ins and road floo@@ ding the rescue from inhabitants of their houses in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and teaching loss in five school districts .
the C@@ BS subsidiary WW@@ L reported that there was floo@@ ded homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa 200 .
the inhabitants were evacu@@ ated in two churches , which have now been floo@@ ded .
the ruler of the community Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities were saved 72 people and seven pets that were killed by floods .
in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency accommodations were furnished to accommodate the evacu@@ ation .
&quot; once the water starts to return , they will return to their houses , &quot; he said .
in the town of Ham@@ mond of the municipality Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozen roads have been closed due to high water and sand bags for the residents , which hope to hold the water from their houses and shops .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last big flood which we had , was in March &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this seems to become a similar incident .
in fact , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Harrison Count@@ ys told it to rain on the Gulf Coast .
according to his information , a hand@@ ful of hand@@ ful houses have been reported to be floo@@ ded on Thursday , but on Friday so far as announced .
K@@ eit@@ h Town@@ son , manager at Sh@@ op@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen water in places where I &apos;ve never seen before , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Town@@ son , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it still comes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mah@@ aj Brown , 6 , &quot; pier@@ ced by balls , &quot; survived the shooting in Philadelphia
the police shares that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week had already been the second time that a 6 year old child is connected .
the grand@@ parents of the boys identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Mah@@ aj Brown .
the grand@@ parents gave that Brown suffered several scra@@ p attacks , including in the evenings , leg , arm and belly , but that he was hosp@@ ital@@ ized by his transport into the hospital .
&quot; he has made many , his small body was pier@@ ced by balls , &quot; he divided his grand@@ mother Del@@ icious Mel@@ ende@@ z to the transmitter .
I can &apos;t believe that .
the state of the boys was considered critical in a hospital , and he had to under@@ go to several operations .

why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that is what I joined to myself among women &apos;s olymp@@ ic audience in the Tur@@ ns and for more than a reason .
I &apos;ve been doing so dominant since 1984 at every summer Olympics and the USA were not so dominant .
and second : this team has three gymn@@ ast , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren , Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspired for many young girls of other skin colour @-@ inspir@@ ing .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jü@@ din is and Madison Ko@@ cian , the Cath@@ o@@ kin , is proud of everyone .
this team finally reflects the USA .
it has been the black and h@@ isp@@ anic female presence at the tip of this sport .
during the past four years , number one was one A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American woman .
last year , Simone and Gab@@ by were # 1 and # 2 .
that shows starch .
in the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas had a surprising Olympic win and in America .
now the world was able to be witness of incredible performance of the triple world champion in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they unexpected , but master@@ ful Gy@@ ma@@ st@@ ics rout@@ ines .
on Thursday , Simone was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American artist , who won gold in an individual multi@@ event event for women .
member of the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we experience the tip of this sport , but they do not see turn@@ outs throughout the country .
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie beat all the same way as A@@ ly and Madison , to create it to the Olympic team .
they are the &quot; Last Five , &quot; because the next Olympics will only have four gymn@@ ast in the team . Moreover , this is the last year with Marta Kar@@ ol@@ yi as trainer .
but reality sees so that Tur@@ ns sees a expensive sport and Turner first line in private gy@@ ms , which are maintained by parents , which will hold their training , income , competition and hotel costs ( for the trainer and their families and families ) .
the majority of these turn@@ around lying in we@@ al@@ thy suburbs , which can support business .
in these verses , Turner obtained her entire training and it &apos;s a long @-@ term commitment for the families .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , both of their athletes have trained , since they started with the Tur@@ ns .
we have to be inspired to the congregations Au@@ n in@@ numer@@ able , young girls , which are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , an affordable and easily accessible turn@@ able training .
I founded my Turn@@ stiftung of 20 years ago .
for my events we have offered free and affordable Tur@@ ns in Harlem for over 15,000 people ( especially black and h@@ isp@@ anic ) and trained national and international winner .
in September , we will expand to Detroit ( my home town ) to learn the youth &apos;s high @-@ quality gymn@@ asts , who earn the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sports .
Tur@@ ns developed strength , flexibility and coordination to the body as well as hard work , discipline and determin@@ at@@ ness of the mind .
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team , who bring thousands of young girls to be interested in the tur@@ tle and that &apos;s great .
it &apos;s so important to take part in the sport , especially for girls .
this is an exciting time .
thank you Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Madison for this real presentation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ es of the Olympic team golden and thank you for so many young girls with different background motiv@@ ates to begin healthy , strong and successful young women .
assistant doctors would like to organ@@ ise other strikes , after they decided to accept Jeremy Hun@@ ts suggest@@ ion
the Minister had hop@@ ed to end the dispute over the changes due to the adoption of a re@@ formed agreement with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of 37@@ ,000 assistant doctors that refused to vote .
in July , Hunt plans had been revealed to introduce the agreement and said that the N@@ HS would be in a &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; and any further delay for workers and patients were harmful .
the first assist@@ ants are to receive a new contract , which contains changes to night@@ life and weekly work to improve the care times .
Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the chairman of the BM@@ A Com@@ mit@@ tedly for assistance conf@@ essed last night in a communication with : &quot; assistant dr@@ yers have to heat up serious concerns , in particular that it is supposed to treat all doctors just to treat all doctors . &quot;
only eight weeks that remain still remain until the first group of doctors falling under the new contract must have made progress and the time runs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; effort by the BM@@ A to resol@@ ve the disputes resulting from convers@@ ations with regard to resist@@ ors &apos; accounts and sometimes on o@@ hren@@ olog@@ ous silence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was the case that Jeremy Hunt had only made last month , that his door should always be open .
&quot; Jeremy Hunt must now act for comm@@ en@@ ing up and protect the concerns of the assistance of assist@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if he do not do this , however , the assist@@ ants have made clear that they are ready to conduct another working precau@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last strike at the end of April saw a bar@@ ge of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 sched@@ ules , as n@@ urses and specialist labor@@ ers were involved in order to grant doctors on the string of cover .
the Minister had hop@@ ed to end the dispute over the changes due to the adoption of the re@@ formed agreement with the British Medical Association .
the BM@@ A wants to be a better week@@ day re@@ mun@@ eration for the 54@@ ,000 assist@@ anc@@ ill@@ ers who are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ tim@@ ers , Director General of the N@@ HS employees , demanded the assistant to stop the strike .
Mor@@ tim@@ ers said : &quot; labour campaign can reach nothing of the poor , but already super@@ charged teams and service providers and prepare the patient , care , and their families only wor@@ ries , trouble and inter@@ ruption . &quot;
in the last two months , we spoke to the com@@ edy of the assistant to me and with the Ministry of Health and other minist@@ ries have been positive to the concerns relating to the aff@@ inity and of the W@@ hist@@ leb@@ ars .
the employer hop@@ ed that the continuing positive commitment to other important topics - such as deployment , flexibility in medicine , training courses , mutual recognition of training , continuing education and health ministry regarding compliance with the BM@@ A in November , February and May .
the £ 2 per day medicine that can reduce cardi@@ ac disease
thousands of heart inf@@ ectious agents are benefit from a £ 2 per day medicine , after being recommended by the authorities , this more people had to say for a longer period of time .
the ag@@ ul@@ ant medication T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of recur@@ rent heart attacks for persons with a heart disease .
the medicine is administered for 12 months after a heart attack , thereby reducing the risk of stroke or another heart attack .
the regulatory Authority N@@ ICE of N@@ HS has recommended a four years @-@ long taking to further reduce cardiovascular problems .
the regulatory Authority N@@ ICE of N@@ HS has recommended a four years @-@ long taking to further reduce cardiovascular problems .
about 14@@ 0.000 people each year have a heart attack and a quarter of which suffer other heart attack or stroke .
heart attacks and stro@@ kes are caused by pressing the fet@@ al material in the ar@@ tery walls which make pads .
when the layer breaks out , there may cause a blood cl@@ ots that stops the blood flow up to the heart and caused a heart attack .
if the blood cl@@ ots solves , it can flow through the flow of blood flow and ble@@ eding to the brain , causing a stroke .
people who had already had a heart attack , subject to higher risk with a higher risk .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and marketed under the trade name Br@@ ili@@ que , reduces this risk by increasing the formation of blood cl@@ ots un@@ likely .
the initial bill of N@@ ICE , which today has been published today , recommends a 12 @-@ month consumption of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg twice daily taking A@@ spir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE health prevention centre said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all persons suffered a heart attack , or a stroke , often with disast@@ rous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of one person .
the experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with A@@ spir@@ in effectively in the reduction of further heart attacks and stro@@ kes in people who already had a heart attack .
by a preliminary recommendation of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or we are pleased that we are able to extend the options of treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it .
the information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of blood - is limited to a period of up to three years . the bill is recommended that any treatment will go out over this period .
culture of Political Cor@@ respon@@ ness is to bl@@ oss@@ om in Muslim places
the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed from the office of a government statement on corruption in the last year .
in addition , a culture of Political Cor@@ respon@@ ness has led to the most common election of Muslim churches , as well as a devastating government report revealed today .
the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pic@@ kl@@ es banned the police , election observation and Rath@@ enth@@ ouses to have ig@@ no@@ red evidence of campaign abuse due to suspic@@ ion regarding eth@@ nic@@ ities and religion . &quot;
the former minister for integration and municipal government , which is now a anti @-@ corruption ver@@ te@@ br@@ is , said that it should be allowed to establish di@@ pping bands outside of elec@@ trol@@ ytes outside of elec@@ trol@@ ls to protect the voters .
he recommends that voters should lead a ID to prove their identity in elections .
currently , a voters must just call his name and address .
the report proposes that , not remove ink on the finger of a person , if it cho@@ oses their vote to prevent someone sel@@ ects twice .
W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower should get more protection , says Sir Eric .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he calls for the press more access to community documents and decisions of non @-@ official committees or working groups should be accepted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not only for campaigns , but also the municipal government should protect against the wider corruption and financial aux@@ ili@@ arch , which goes down , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was arranged by Dow@@ ning Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ lets Constitu@@ encies in the Middle East .
last year , a special command@@ ing Court decided that the Mayor of the Mayor of Rah@@ man went for Rah@@ man to corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Court found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in cy@@ n@@ ical manner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that he would have killed his critics with rac@@ ism and Islam@@ op@@ hob@@ ic alleg@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man should have led his campaign on the basis of that it is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reli@@ ev@@ ing obligation of Muslims &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to 300 votes were either des@@ per@@ ate or the result of a rep@@ lica when someone else cho@@ oses one person .
Sir Eric said that in the whole country is proof of fraud .
in particular , he im@@ pover@@ ished in particular al@@ ar@@ ming of the col@@ lusive play - among the older members of the Muslim community pressure on people , candidates to choose one of their choice .
Sir Eric , depicted , he made several recommendations to clean the elec@@ toral system , including the fo@@ t of evidence to prove the identity
in his report it is said : &quot; as proof was appropriate that pressure on protection needs of some eth@@ ical min@@ orities have been exercis@@ ed , especially women and young people , in order to select according to the welcome of the elderly , in particular communities with Pakistan or ban@@ an background .
&quot; there was concerns that ... state institutions such as state institutions such a behaviour of &quot; polit@@ ically correct &quot; consider@@ ations regarding eth@@ no and religion . &quot;
Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the ban that political activists documents necessary to stop &quot; elec@@ toral &quot; .
the report , which is drawn by Ther@@ esa May , is required to prevent the tough@@ er registration testing , to prevent the elec@@ toral directory for immigration and social gu@@ ill@@ ations .
options in consideration , voters before your choice to ask your identity .
not removable ink on your finger of one person as soon as they were submitted their voice to prevent that someone cho@@ oses twice .
systematic reviews of the nationality of a person shall be carried out to ensure that they are eligible .
a three @-@ year limitation of mot@@ ions on an automatic post@@ code .
ban that political activists complete the post@@ age and env@@ elop@@ es of letters .
to give the police the police , setting out un@@ locking stations for election stations .
an amendment seeking for in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation in accordance with the Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 ( People &apos;s Liability Act 1983 ) .
Phot@@ ograph@@ er in voting stations .
requirement you may only be used in the elec@@ toral stations ( with the exception of Wales ) .
intensi@@ fying the training , to ensure that the employees are the rule that voters go to the cabin alone .
Sir Eric falls on the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that after Tower Ham@@ lets you have not made a criminal case .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the elec@@ toral court has Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his deputy for damages of corrupt and illegal practices &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was due to a number of reasons for reasons , in accordance with the high demands on the basis of the criminal procedure - guilty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he critic@@ ises the most effective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check @-@ control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the elec@@ toral members of the Town H@@ alls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sir Eric said : &quot; the Court of Justice in Ham@@ lets from the last year was a warning signal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our country carries a proud legacy as the mother of par@@ liam@@ ents , but den@@ ying the concern and spread of a number of authorities and thre@@ aten them good reputation . &quot; &quot; &quot;

we quickly met our spectators at our audience night and exc@@ use our followers in social media .

buyer in Pri@@ mark emp@@ iri@@ cal about woman , tried in the middle of the shop under@@ wear under@@ wear
the buyer did not know where they should see when a woman went up their clothes in the midst of a Pri@@ mark to try underwater .
in order to wor@@ ms the situation , she numbered her , as she looked at her , and restored it again into the shelf .
she went on and tried four pairs of p@@ ants in a shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ stone , Austria .
the landmark business in the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , in which the woman tried the sub@@ p@@ ants before they set them back into the shelf
a mother of two children , J@@ enny David@@ son who had been at the same time in the business , said that after the mysterious woman had tried her under@@ wear , &quot; she came back and left the shop without buying something . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men could not believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of the sales area , she took a pair of p@@ ants from the stock , moved out their own stock@@ pil@@ es and p@@ ants , and tried them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she tried not to find a somewhat dis@@ crete place to do it - she was simply because it was easy as Oskar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every star@@ red when she with@@ drew off the p@@ ants , who didn &apos;t have liked to have her back into the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she repeated the same with three other sub @-@ tro@@ users , before they finally decided that you did nothing at last , and went out again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they seemed not to be anno@@ yed when someone observ@@ ances them - or over the person who would not buy the sub@@ p@@ ants under circumstances . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. David@@ son , 33 who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as opposed to his home that someone would like to take away another person , who had not first washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; woman David@@ son added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I have received , the employees have attempted to pull out the garments from the sale after she went - what exactly is good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate it with a new pair of p@@ ants to go home and find out that another wife had her and re@@ washed and didn &apos;t wash them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a speaker of Pri@@ mark said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is concerned , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of , deliber@@ ately on Tuesday , 9 August at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot; &quot; &quot;

how to protect himself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a from weapon
the world outside is a dangerous place but this video of D@@ ail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it a little saf@@ er .
we talked to Rh@@ on Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to move with armed rob@@ bers on the distance .
regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or behind you will show you this video as you turn around the spe@@ ar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you turn back from behind him , then you should see yourself as a necessity , so that you can see your att@@ acker and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the scra@@ p &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
take the weapon then between your fore@@ arm and your shoulder before you beat the face with your free el@@ bow .
then strike him with the k@@ nee and rotate it , while the attack@@ ers turn off against pain , the weapon of his hands . beat him with the run into the face and move down , while they move the weapon on him .
when attack@@ ers are approaching from the front , the technology is similar - move your body from the scra@@ p line , take the weapon and turn them away , so that the attack@@ ers can not shoot .
in the same time , store the weight on the weapon and beat the attack@@ ers on the chest , then turn the weapon from its handle , before moving forward and judge the weapon .
sounds difficult ?
see the video to see how it peaks in Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
but remember that there is a rob@@ ber@@ y on the saf@@ est , your money is too exc@@ essive - if you are no Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ masters .

the thought , the r@@ ins@@ ing wheel of a toilet cass@@ ette , which was already used by thousands of others , doesn &apos;t really stum@@ bling , but in fact , there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen molecules .
on his journey through Europe , Mr. Wright with doctors and medical staff on the promotion of intest@@ inal bacter@@ ias and his own health .
fortunately , he left nothing that he le@@ aked , more than a bad neighbour in the mouth .
Mr. Wright became known to test the resistance of his intest@@ inal , having traveled by the world and ate great things as well as marv@@ ell@@ ous things .
from public funds to railway stations until r@@ ins@@ ing buttons of toilets , the task assigned its immune system definitely under a sample
in the film he told , &quot; as a child I was relatively un@@ careful what my health was concerned and I put all possible things in my mouth , Earth , wor@@ ms and mud . &quot;
in the film , it was justified to his call every case .
the only thing that he refused , was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his test line showed a L@@ umin@@ omet@@ rics number of over 4000 units .
in comparison , the L@@ umin@@ omet@@ rics number is fresh@@ ly washed hands less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet which he refused to swal@@ low after their L@@ umin@@ omet@@ rics count exceeds 4000 units , while fresh@@ ly washed hands have one of less than 60 .
Mr Wright and the Finnish manufacturers of dairy products Vali@@ d produced the travel film &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength , &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; That comes the worst thing which I have straight in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are nothing rub@@ b@@ ess than that !
I will nothing like it , because it is inside wrong here .
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength &quot; was produced in cooperation with the Finnish producer of dairy products Vali@@ um .
the company stat@@ uses Mr. Wright with Vali@@ dation Ge@@ ograph@@ us that contains both l@@ actic acid bacteria as well as Vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intest@@ inal bacter@@ ias and the immune system .
validation Senior Venice President for snacks , ju@@ ices and new categories N@@ iko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we really wanted to offer consumers really something new .
something that is fascinating , and the benefits of Pro@@ biotics explained at the same time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we had crazy Bra@@ inst@@ or@@ m@@ ings , with this means that we said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ ass to call us Ian . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they claim that the interest in intest@@ inal health is becoming a global phenomenon
instead of just about the products , we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the meaning of the intest@@ inal health and how it is linked to the immune system .
the growing interest in intest@@ inal health is a global phenomenon , and with the documentary we could provide more information on an interesting way .
I think the film shows that we have a great sense of hum@@ or !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the direc@@ ting of the film , added : &quot; let me lost my respect for Ian , when he had tast@@ ed some of the things which I had instructed him , such as the ek@@ y Russian toilet that will be shown in the film . &quot;
of course there were things , when it was easier to bring Ian , to aw@@ aking them and others , where it was pretty difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad that we have recorded some of these dirty le@@ ak@@ ry paintings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in one of the survey carried out in 2015 , 84 percent of respon@@ dents were associated with the well@@ being of Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us bacteria , particularly with the well@@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 per cent said that they must be used at least occasionally products requiring l@@ actic acid bacteria .
A@@ social family destroyed from Del@@ og@@ ation social apartment in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
a medi@@ al family left their social apartment after a dol@@ og@@ ation with a damage of £ 50,000 , because they are attack@@ ing their neigh@@ bors .
Tan@@ ya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their estate in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after having been for@@ ci@@ bly removed from their estate , sho@@ cked employees of the association found ownership in an ir@@ repar@@ able state .
the walls made cro@@ pping holes on a wooden sticks , rub@@ b@@ ish were scattered on the floor , and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubri@@ cated on walls .
the family were settled and it is assumed that they now live in a private accommodation
Donn@@ a Mc@@ Ev@@ o@@ y , who works for home administration in Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that they don &apos;t want to repair the apartment no more .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare here and I am the view that people must not live in this way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many things to consider because this property is probably considered as a beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ ori@@ ous and their reputation is also .
the pair had three sons , who lived in the apartment and the police said that the terror which had been added to the family , street children with bas@@ eline , drug abuse , drug traff@@ icking , drug traff@@ icking , drug traff@@ icking , drug traff@@ icking and the floods .
sk@@ el@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease agreement , an arrangement for non @-@ iso@@ avi@@ our behavior was in June .
in some rooms of the house that will be torn down under circumstances , the age of rub@@ b@@ ish was found
they have been tra@@ ded in the estate in which past drugs were torn down in the past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ eigh@@ bours said they &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fighting broke out on the street and had to be called a regular police regularly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing served them and their partners this week for@@ ci@@ bly taken from the property after they gave them an extended term of 11 weeks to voluntarily .
the Del@@ og@@ ging were sh@@ out by facilit@@ ated neighbours , who said that her life was made for hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were not ashamed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years beside them and it was always bad .
the countless times , which we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; tomorrow we could not sleep . &quot;
we stood there , because it was so quiet - that &apos;s not always lived here !
now , where they &apos;re finally away , it will be beautiful .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ our@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing said that it would have had to co@@ operate the family with local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police was called in regular intervals , 20 years long .
on the covered side of the municipal house , gar@@ bage and old toys were thrown down
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a dis@@ grace that there is a ten@@ ants to accept any responsibility for their behavior and of their family , as a Del@@ og@@ ation is always the last step , the Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing is considered . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was a very difficult case , because the behavior was extremely difficult and their do@@ ings had to be dar@@ kened in their neighbours .
I guess all the work that my team , the police from Devon and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the commune , who went to us and have made us the information to come .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope that this development will don@@ ate some neigh@@ bors , and the message that ant@@ iso@@ ara will not toler@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house , but that they all should be over 20 .
a dirty mattress included in one of the bedrooms of the house after the delay on the floor .
workers of the home @-@ management are now to hide a refuse storage that is surrounded by the house
in 2014 , the police introduced a raid in the house and took over 70@@ g cannabis as well as orph@@ ans , par@@ ap@@ her@@ al@@ ies and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sk@@ el@@ ah received a fine , after having pleaded guilty of the owners of a drug B in trade respect . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she claimed that the money was killed for a gra@@ vest@@ one of her son Lee Skel@@ don who died in 2013 during a car accident .
after having gone without hom@@ eless , Tan@@ ya and her partner have now been living in a private property at Pl@@ ymouth .
many crafts@@ men of the house were filled with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the Police says that she will not keep ten@@ ants , who do not keep house rules
Angela Cro@@ w by the police from Devon and Corn@@ wall divided that the Del@@ og@@ ation has a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants which do not keep the assignment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who remember itself without deduc@@ tions , as well as to those who were trained by a behavior , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police from Devon and Corn@@ wall is never toler@@ ate of criminal and ant@@ iso@@ ara behaviour that continue to work with partners to protect our churches .

Donald Tr@@ ump Ac@@ t ″ Power Problems ″ in the Election Fight
the leadership of the U.S. Repub@@ lic@@ ans is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive wor@@ ries , also in traditionally conservative states of their majority .
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump has now put weakness in his campaign campaign in the existing Republi@@ can high@@ lands Utah .
a rare moment , in which the usually great @-@ track and self @-@ safe mul@@ at@@ illi@@ on@@ aire reported as something such concerns expressed as correspon@@ dents .
after having thrown 16 rival in his own Republi@@ can camp from the race , the doub@@ ts about his success in the fight for the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have massive problems in Utah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump from evangel@@ ical Christians , which he asked assistance in key states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to bl@@ ame are false reports about his candidate , he again took his familiar media .
Republi@@ can sound bur@@ s@@ wine
Utah normally is a safe bank for the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
a survey conducted by Sur@@ vey@@ or in June 1999 was Tr@@ ump and his competitors from the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton , at the same time .
other institutions see Tr@@ ump in front , but not with the distance that is common for republi@@ can candidates in the state .
as a risk , Arizona and Georgia are currently being endangered .
in an interview with the Sen@@ ders CN@@ BC Tr@@ ump answered the question as he had to stop the way of Clin@@ ton : &quot; just as I did so far . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and whether back : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either a successful , or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he does not make anything other than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tell the truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is not rich for him at the end of reasons of political correc@@ t@@ ness , this is the order that Tr@@ ump continued .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , Tr@@ ump sum will then be said to mark the support for his election campaign , it should not be able to present a better change .
instead of what you would like the candidates of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans for Congress stronger than the arms .
Olympia : Dre@@ aming Sc@@ am with D@@ oping @-@ Test
the IOC wants to setup a Dis@@ cipl@@ inary Commission for the event .
Ken@@ yan athletes threat@@ ens after the second doping aff@@ air in the Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games .
following an attempt at a D@@ oping control in the Olympic Village , Kenya has sent a coach to home .
the International Olympic Committee divided into setting up a discipl@@ ines of Dis@@ cipl@@ inary Commission to investigate the case .
a ken@@ ian functional state had informed that the former Sprinter and today &apos;s coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , in the Olympic village under the name of the 800 @-@ metre sal@@ es@@ man Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i were submitted .
this is the team management of Kenya from the D@@ oping @-@ Control@@ lers .
the World Federation IA@@ AF has searched the case for information about the case to strict investigations , a IA@@ AF speaker with an IA@@ AF speaker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the following measures of the IOC the IA@@ AF will show an assessment of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the IA@@ AF was stated in a IA@@ AF Declaration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) has gone towards D@@ oping control station and signed as Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i , given the sample and signed , &quot; said Ken@@ ia Chief of Mission Stephan ar@@ ap So@@ i .
he was the possession of the athletes that stood on the list for the training of the world anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency .
Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i was founded in 2015 in Beijing World Cup @-@ fourth over 800 meters .
four days previously , the Ken@@ yan Chancellor of Delegation Michael Rot@@ ich had been deduc@@ ted from the Rio games .
it should be informed against cash payments of his country over the D@@ oping tests .
according to media reports , he was arrested in Nairobi at his return to Nairobi airport .
Kenya has already been a special observation period for the IOC to many doping control since longer period .
during the announcement of the more than 2000 D@@ oping target check , in front of the Rio games , un@@ explained that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia will be taken into the visor .
the world anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency had a lot of pressure on the African country in Brazil , a anti @-@ D@@ oping law and a functional control system .
the law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympic start .
as a consequence , WA@@ DA has taken Kenya from the list of countries whose D@@ oping @-@ fight con@@ forms to the WA@@ DA rules .
Kenya is considered a big runner @-@ nation .
athletes of the country won most medals in Beijing at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
in a series of television reports on the ARD , ARD and German TV reports were able to easily accessible that D@@ oping @-@ funds will be easily accessible and there will be a significant ment@@ ality of the sports club .
IOC member Richard Po@@ und therefore demanded a similar investigation in Kenya as he had asked them in the Russian Athletics Men .
it has been demonstrated that in this sport @-@ wide surface area and systematic ge@@ op@@ t has been demonstrated .
Russia athletes were then excluded from the summer .
Salzburger &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli
in the Shakespeare @-@ year the Salzburg Festival is presenting the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tra@@ gic couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et .

one musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story &quot; , Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ st@@ one master@@ piece .
the artistic director Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical in the temple of the Classic and filled with the role of Mary a youth room .
in the orchestra he dig@@ ged the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var orchestra under the direction of Venezu@@ elan Con@@ ductor Gust@@ av@@ o D@@ ud@@ amel : &quot; this music is full of rhythm . &quot;
we always say that they are very Latin @-@ American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their pace and their mel@@ ody .
it is a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really are Bern@@ st@@ one music really in our blood !
in this production , Bart@@ oli plays a older child so@@ ber .
she reminds of her lovers of Tony with Tony , while the younger Mary plays and dancing .
the role of Mary has always fascin@@ ated me .
first , because she is exceptional !
and then Mari@@ as &apos;s personality would be .
she says it in her song : &quot; I feel v@@ t@@ ty , oh so Pre@@ t@@ ty , I feel v@@ t@@ ty and wit@@ ty and B@@ right . &quot;
so , it is smart , of course also n@@ ai@@ v , and very passionate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she resem@@ bles me very , my Italian character I like Roman in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; laugh@@ s Bart@@ oli . &quot; &quot; &quot;
D@@ ud@@ amel is full of than@@ ksgiving for the opera singer : &quot; Cec@@ ilia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is so honour for us to work with her .
she is a tremend@@ ous man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Bart@@ oli gives the compli@@ ment back : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ud@@ amel is such an extraordinary artists and very passionate ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
one can see it in any of his movements , in his eyes , it is his life !
it is such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion , and a happy approach to life , which is very important at all !
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is uploaded : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this piece it is about advantages and fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
today we left the refugees , then the Pu@@ ertor@@ ian people went to New York , and the New York residents wanted them not .
the same issues are the same subject , and they are still meaning@@ ful today as that .
59 years later , the piece is still relevant .

Turkey : Kur@@ dish community anticip@@ ates mass flight
&quot; whoever does not adap@@ ts and Erd@@ og@@ an , sits on the packed caffeine , &quot; says the Chair of the Gü@@ len Foundation Dialog and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un .
the Kur@@ dish Municipality of Germany anticip@@ ates tens of tens of thousands of refuge from Turkey to Germany in the short term .
in the medium term , there could even be &quot; some hundred thousand , &quot; the presi@@ ding chairman Ali Top@@ ra@@ k will be .
because of the hard ancest@@ or of Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erd@@ og@@ an , after the coup attempt , the Kur@@ dish Community is expecting a mass flight to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the short term I reck@@ oned with tens of thousands of thousands of protection from Turkey in the medium term , when the Erd@@ og@@ an regime continued to fought the min@@ orities and the democratic opposition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the subject @-@ president Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because the government already passed away in the months of Kur@@ dish E@@ bur@@ gen , 500,000 Kur@@ ds were within Turkey on the run .
after the failed coup and se@@ cular ethnic Turks were added after the failed p@@ utsch .
many will begin in Europe if they are going to be re@@ pressed in Turkey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state that takes refugees to refugees in their own country refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chief of Staff indicted the targeted settlement of Syrian Arab in Kur@@ dish , but also in al@@ ev@@ it@@ ical cities .
thus , Erd@@ og@@ an would increase the export pressure to the remaining curves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the last great minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have been wi@@ ped out &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U member . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Chief of Staff demanded that the Federal Government positioned itself as sharp as Austria against Erd@@ og@@ an and its trailer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also in Germany , one &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hex@@ ab@@ out@@ d &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; takes place against Erd@@ og@@ an critics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel no longer in Germany for the first time in the last months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement fears the escape of many Turks abroad .
more Turks are searching for asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Opp@@ os@@ ition@@ elle .
the fire mark as a Gü@@ len tra@@ ilers , the teachers and other graduates the professional existence .
&quot; whoever does not adap@@ ts and Erd@@ og@@ an , sits on packed caffeine , b@@ aked up the ma@@ ize and se@@ cular ones , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , Chairman of the Gü@@ len Foundation Dialogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot;
as the newspaper reports on appeal on figures from the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs , the Turks already made the largest group of political persecution recognised for political persecution in Germany before the coup .
at the reporting date June 30 , this is 11.@@ 386 people and thus just under 29 percent of all than as@@ yl@@ benzene has been recognized ( 3@@ 9.@@ 625 ) .
in this survey , there is no gu@@ arded before war , poverty or Per@@ tiv@@ el@@ ess@@ ness .
asylum seek@@ ers right after the Basic Law are exclusively polit@@ ically , i.e. from state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ government .
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; going where there are we@@ aving &quot;
Sel@@ ts@@ ames Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the loc@@ als will not get out of summer campaigns with - and the holidays from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia must not choose the Land@@ tag .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood .
if the Parliament election will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays , the focal point has decided already in the beginning of the year .
for more than so far , it does not work : summer vacation , heat and land battle - that b@@ lows itself .
the loc@@ als that are convinced by the election are to be convinced by holiday .
most of the tourists who are in the country are on U@@ se@@ dom , Rü@@ gen , or Hid@@ den@@ see , are no loc@@ als , so not allowed to choose the country .
we get practical problems : in the holiday there are hel@@ pers , fl@@ ashing the posters , fl@@ ashing the bal@@ lo@@ ons , fl@@ yers and count towards the end of the vote , only tired .
until the 4th of September , 2016 , the election and the last day of the route , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to leave once again elec@@ toral struggle over the people .
the hot phase , if you can say that at all , has just started .
and there is also something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CD@@ U Coalition , must fear his ministry .
the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now in pol@@ ls clearly behind the CD@@ U .
exciting , such as strong new@@ bor@@ ing Af@@ D is cuts and what remains at the end of co@@ al@@ ition@@ ary .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 head of government , making an almost in@@ consp@@ ic@@ uous campaign , one sees of his grand@@ parents .
he travels across the country , spread ro@@ ses and pl@@ au@@ ts a little with the people , as it did his legendary artist Harald Ring@@ stor@@ ff .
otherwise the soul got cold feet and gives German Chancellor Merkel bl@@ ame the bl@@ oss@@ om of the Af@@ D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their refugee policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We create this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have accelerated the ascent of the pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably cost him now . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U with its leading candidates , the Minister of Interior Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ i@@ osity , has experienced , as it is , if you make a false time at the right place of election campaign .
it has invited twice German Chancellor Angela Merkel to major exploration , Merkel of the German Bundestag team in the nor@@ the@@ astern .
but the target group did not claim that there were more Nordrhein @-@ Westfalen , Berlin and Saxony as the Mecklenburg and Vorpommern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority from other federal states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary @-@ General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in N@@ DR . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but there too bad no one from other corners of Germany . Angela Merkel must listen to Angela Merkel .
otherwise the Nor@@ theast CD@@ U reno@@ un@@ ces the usual turn@@ able distances on market areas and shopping m@@ alls with umbre@@ l@@ las and air bal@@ lo@@ ons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that Kok@@ ts , plays only one &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; minor role &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Union has noted that you have the base of the base that it must be very rig@@ orous to find one wire for the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is like the left , the SPD , the Green Party , hardly available in the times of the country .
however , the Council of the CD@@ U vot@@ er sel@@ fers in his fel@@ low@@ soldier is even sel@@ f@@ ailing : &quot; you have to go where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ est , Golden weddings , every birthday party must be used . &quot;
because there stands a lot on the game , Sell@@ ering has called his SPD to become a particularly dedicated elec@@ toral struggle .
in pol@@ ls the Socialists and Democrats were last modified 22 percent behind partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just ahead of Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
at the election of 2011 , the SPD had already won with 3@@ 5.6 percent in front of the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
the gre@@ enery , small par@@ ab@@ bey , with seven percent in the surveys , will be able to create the leap into the land .
from the holiday of distress , they make a modern t@@ ug@@ end and hide their turn@@ out large part in the internet .
&quot; online election campaign &quot; calls for the Presidency of the Claudia Müller .
otherwise , green elec@@ toral members are looking for loc@@ als to native vo@@ cal citizens among holidays .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the leading candidates , cur@@ v@@ t straight away with a house@@ boat by the Mecklenburg Lake Lakes and is also beautiful .
her impression : &quot; election vacation in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is no punishment . &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ Rehabilitation : visiting sites suffer from blocking
at the speed , with which the B 27 turns , there is nothing to be cont@@ ag@@ ious .
for the persons responsible for the construction work , begin at 5.@@ 30 in the morning and only at 20 o &apos;clock , there is sole discretion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these have done pretty delicate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said El@@ vira T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the jet fuel station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is a superb team .
there is no default .
the construction site was planned to be moved to south at the weekend , until the end of October will be all finished .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the construction of the construction manager will also be comm@@ ended , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it goes to the facility of accommodation rides . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the construction site on Monday to the south , and also the blocking of the Asp@@ erg@@ strasse in O@@ fan@@ d@@ ingen has also been lifted and therefore the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg has now been relaxed , the traffic situation is relaxed within the place .
the citizen can now drive on both sides by O@@ fan@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 .
the way to return through the place seems to be back .
&quot; there were some considerable complaints , &quot; says the responsible for the development of the development of the responsible principal conductor Florian King .
the residents of Bach@@ ar@@ straße , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ n@@ erst@@ raße and Wei@@ her@@ on had to fight with more traffic noise because many ligh@@ ten@@ sions were seeking to commit their Nav@@ i as the signs .
in addition , this resulted in man@@ holes in residential areas .
since the speed limit was not observed , the municipality will intensi@@ fy the impact vehicle from M@@ ös@@ sing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were substantial over@@ rides , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says King , who made himself a spot on the location . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they have been b@@ illed two to three per minute .
the quick@@ est speed was on the speed of 77 kilometres per kilometre in the pace @-@ 30 zone .
it has been on the construction site since the construction site has been qui@@ eter .
for the business@@ men at the B 27 it is only a small comfort that for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg are now open the road again .
in the cards , business@@ men do not want to look like .
but that the B 27 re@@ development has led to them in sales , everybody is looking forward to look .
but some more and some are affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if anyone has to do with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; end &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; less to do other firms , for which the re@@ development has hardly consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; even when Aut@@ oh@@ aus Mai@@ er talks about a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most slight decrease , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but also a wonder &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the drive is missing &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most appreciated is the streets along the street .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds clear words .
this is already threat@@ ening .
not only him , but all facilities have &quot; hard hit it &quot; hard . &quot;
they were missing the customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ tw@@ eil .
we must be glad over any Euro turnover .
the share of sales has risen to &quot; far above 50 percent . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the street children have been thrown in operation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he must have dismissed the half of his staff .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and the half had been dismissed , the policy would have responded different .
instead , government manager Jörg Schmidt on a request of G@@ öh@@ ner , to give it a financial compensation , with the hint that the restaurant has also benef@@ ited from the advantages of the position on the B 27 . now they also emphas@@ ize the dis@@ advantages that result in the restoration .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other coun@@ ties where something gener@@ ously handled .
in all cases , G@@ öh@@ ner is safe to continue its restaurant .
finally , the family @-@ run company has already been located here since 17@@ 15 and refers to the long history .
that other family guests are now allowed to understand less frequently due to the complicated traffic management less frequently .
if one cannot proceed , it &apos;s also pretty good .
that his regular climate was back again after the end of the renovation works , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt .
despite the cr@@ ises with BSE and bird flu , G@@ öh@@ ner keeps the impact of the B 27 construction work on its customers for the biggest crisis which has experienced its restaurant in their long@@ time history .
six months of construction , this is already brutal .
we are constantly screw@@ ed in the name of terror control in law .
following the recent attacks , Interior Minister de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is now a th@@ icker security package .
but what has a Dul@@ ce status with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all that ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the assemblies .
all his suggestions have to be polit@@ ically reasonable &quot; polit@@ ically , &quot; says the Federal Minister of Foreign Affairs at the presentation of his new security package .
they are reas@@ on@@ ably priced .
other , further points would initially be discussed within the parties .
also I particip@@ ates myself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Minister of the Interior may be given him a result and on a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ cover@@ able con@@ sen@@ sus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the Coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
following the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère was a little time to submit his conclusions for safety in the republic .
but they are so many more extensive .
quite a lot is already known , announced , announced : that a new security authority should take care of the cra@@ ck , is not new .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also the fact that Germany must implement multiple EU requirements for passenger data and arms . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the call for more video surveillance and staff for security authorities is also un@@ surprising .
in part , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère starts a second attempt on proposals to date with the SPD : he wants to put sympath@@ y for terrorist groups under punishment and Ji@@ hadi@@ sts with double citizenship to the German passport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they will be difficult for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U @-@ man &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he still hold this for reasonable and challenging nothing , nothing at the coalition partner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few new ideas to be presented by Mai@@ zi@@ ère .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are partly in itself : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is planning a quick method for moving shi@@ fts and more possibilities to the exp@@ ulsion of people in front of deportation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
refugees who are targeted specifically to the country should check out their smartphone and check social media accounts for a safety review .
con@@ test@@ ants for recru@@ ited asylum seek@@ ers to date , he wants to throw some worse than so far - such that off@@ ences will go away or throw their papers to wear their identity .
some of it is political and legally hei@@ men .
man@@ ches even works un@@ equ@@ iv@@ o@@ zo@@ res and questions openly .
and with some points - in the im@@ balance of thought to the example - the question arises : what does this mean to do with security and terror ?
Yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it &apos;s important to differenti@@ ate between the subject of refugees and terror .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it doesn &apos;t allow you to speak that the attacks of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the high refugee figures , many people are wor@@ ried about safety .
and things that were deeply @-@ employed people were not able to en@@ cl@@ ing themselves in elec@@ toral struggle .
the inner safety is enormous .
first attack in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then Att@@ acks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the in@@ safegu@@ arding is large .
and Yes , there are election campaign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Union and the SPD are increasingly concentrated on the subject of internal security . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past days , it went up between the two parties .
only a gar@@ ris@@ er conflict over the equipment of the Federal Police , then on a security policy collection for some Unions of interior minister , in which the ch@@ iefs can also require a b@@ ka @-@ ban and a return of double citizenship .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère l@@ ends itself here to be reconc@@ iling sounds .
from a return of a double pass , he did nothing .
we satis@@ fies the discussion in Germany .
it is not reasonable , don &apos;t sense .
and by a Bur@@ ka @-@ prohibition he did not give any legal concerns .
whether its own package is constitutional on all corners that is constitutional , and whether it actually &quot; reasonable &quot; is for the coalition partner , only must show themselves .
it &apos;s quite a lot , what could cause dispute .
but the SPD is currently being able to pro@@ filing an inner safety on the topic of inner safety .
&quot; &quot; &quot; part@@ ef Sig@@ mar Gabriel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sig@@ mar Gabriel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to speak for all things , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to speak with everything that contributes to safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
still Volkswagen gli@@ mp@@ se comes through .
despite diesel engines , the delivery numbers are rising worldwide .
but not in all markets it runs around .
the help of the recall action is a term .
Volkswagen starts for deliveries in the second half of the year .
despite the many brand &apos;s many brands and some well @-@ running markets , Europe &apos;s largest car bus can be further improved in the previous year .
but in July the core brand VW appeared primarily in Western Europe and thus loaded the sale again , as listed in the D@@ ax @-@ listed company .
worldwide , the VW brand sold them back in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year .
in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year .
in the home market Germany there are deliveries to almost a sixth month .
Mr Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann brand rep@@ lic@@ ates the weaker figures from July , primarily on two sales days less in Europe .
in addition , there &apos;s also some core markets through &quot; changed economic conditions &quot; in some core markets . &quot;
in addition to the situation in Turkey about the coup attempt in Turkey , British vote over@@ threw the withdrawal from the EU , explained a spokesperson .
in the United States , where the exhaust emission tester first es@@ cal@@ ated , is also further increased to a Min@@ us .
large cap for VW is the Chinese market .
all in all , the mainly affected house brand of Lower Saxony continued to further gli@@ mp@@ g through the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months , only a delivery minus of 0.9 percent is to 3,@@ 37 million vehicles .
Group Leader Fred Kap@@ pler was able to continue implementing a sales point from January to July .
Volkswagen delivered its 1.3 percent more vehicles in this time , 5,@@ 904 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had manip@@ ulated the software with a software tests .
in Germany alone , VW is calling for around 2.5 million vehicles to re@@ armament into the workshops .
in the course of re@@ armament , VW , the conversion of the cars had no negative effects .
after the conversion of the vehicles there is no deteri@@ oration with fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine capacity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the bus station for the customers after the retro@@ fitting a &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certificate from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but conf@@ ession &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was not written by a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee , as it was called on Friday in the company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reason to be legal entity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has published its German customers now a guarantee for diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this has confirmed this past Monday VW @-@ representatives at the Federal Office of Germany last Monday .
from the traffic of the traffic was confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has the impact of my inquiry to be fulfilled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to accompl@@ ish &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; der@@ og@@ ations are not accepted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Federal Office of Federal Minister Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) according to the Ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
VW has taken the guarantee that fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine power after conversion has no deteri@@ orations , and will not affect all the relevant data values unchanged .
Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; War@@ ran@@ ty &quot; but not as it was called company &apos;s ties .
in the wide term &quot; Guaran@@ tee &quot; Volkswagen sees the possibility to bring such a half year after the upgrade to a workshop in a workshop - and this could be able to return to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do .
also in customer interests , it is important to prevent any other damage that nothing can do with the sc@@ andal that comes to nothing with regards to possible warranty claims , as it was called .
therefore you use VW the term &quot; War@@ ran@@ ty &quot; guarantee .
the Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank G@@ mund on the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see requires more abundant savings in the future - as the second Institute in Germany .
ban@@ ker Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; it is only available for 139 customers , which accounts for 40 million euros on Gi@@ ro@@ - or daily monetary policy . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Banking Federation speaks of a single incident and sees it no signal : normal savings needs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not fear &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
camp money over night at the European Central Bank ( EC@@ B ) , you need to pay 0.4 per cent pen@@ alties .
this fee will be asked by Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank G@@ mund in September of private and corporate clients for deposits over 100,000 euros on Gi@@ ro@@ - or daily basis .
&quot; the first 100,000 Euros are free . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100.000 cost in the future 400 Euros per year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paul said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he donated more than 40 million euros that could be lifted up from one day to another , and that he could not understand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank account for me on the Central Bank account , and cause 0.4 per cent of costs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bank leader . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t lay 4000 Euros for each one million . &quot;
the costs he would like to go further according to the customer &apos;s principle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cash just in the Tres@@ ors of Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank would have been too dangerous : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have experienced four assault , but I am not even the fifth ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Board member . &quot; &quot; &quot;
most customers have understanding and changes to other investment forms .
only few mig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cooperative association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the extreme monetary policy course of the EC@@ B caused considerable costs in all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it alone to wear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; operating cost @-@ efficient is not possible &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account surveys , credit cards or transfers .
with pen@@ alties for deposits of three million Euro , the Thuring@@ ian People and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank Al@@ ten@@ burg country had head@@ lines with their ski bank offices in 2014 .
Michael Kem@@ mer , Managing Director of the Association of Ban@@ ken@@ ver@@ bandes , said : &quot; we expect to pay a private customer area to pay for deposits , along with banks and savings banks in Germany too much too much . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a ban@@ ker said on T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see it is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a cli@@ ent@@ ele , which is a bit rich in the wealth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can be a problem for a small bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if she is free for free money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
founded in 1911 , co @-@ operatives , G@@ mund has offices in Bad Wies@@ see , R@@ ott@@ ach @-@ don@@ ors , Kre@@ uth , and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .

the President of the Association of German Ban@@ ks and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ banks ( BvR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had declared the end of June : &quot; the threshold , to go to the private customer , is very high . &quot;
the competition is hard , and it threat@@ ening the emig@@ ration of An@@ de@@ ans to competition .

Dest@@ ination Pl@@ ates : who actually bu@@ ys sound records ?
lon@@ ely men love medium @-@ aged plates .
before you go to the comm@@ en@@ eil in order to over@@ l@@ end him under the pseud@@ onym @-@ Al@@ le@@ ap@@ st Men with r@@ ying Bel@@ iev@@ res , this statement leads themselves from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the most comprehensive recovery of records did not want to welcome to a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als , who want to welcome the future of physical objects , but back on mid @-@ life nost@@ algia .
those who have purchased a record , are all fo@@ resi@@ ght according to the age between 45 and 54 .
indeed , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most likely cat group .
there is also no hor@@ des by leisure runners - it has an emotional meaning : older plate buyers retain their feelings rather for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy it alone time ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but agree the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
if this blog would be a news report on TV , I would like to follow the camera while I bear in the midst of a busy street in Soh@@ o , a modest ones before I stand to stop my hands and a little bit like : &quot; so let &apos;s leave us a closer look . &quot;
so let &apos;s throw a look at it .
even if the heart of So@@ H@@ os is slow at its charm , hotels , restaurants and offices are now complete the buildings where independent sellers were resident there - there &apos;s been a hand@@ ful of fantastic plate stores .
I would probably ask the camera of camera to switch the camera for the next part , in which I am in the immediate vicinity of different men in such stores , and try to assess their age and mood by observation .
Stuart from Glasgow , 55 , to the name of S@@ ister Ray ( data number : two young women , three men mean age ) into the Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( data number : eight males , middle @-@ aged people ) , is probably a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through shops in order to fill the few hours .
is it a collectors that I ask ?
&quot; I think , &quot; he says .
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates .
these sound plates , above ( he sent me the snap@@ shot by e @-@ mail , I was not followed him , followed by the walls of his room .
the reason why it owns an important number of albums and singles , the result of his available income : it is now in the position to buy records , which he was able to buy and again buy items , which he sold , when he was young and ple@@ ite .
&quot; many things I buy , are from the late 1960s , early &apos; 70s , which was released when I was 11 or 12 . things I thought something too young was to buy them , &quot; he says .
he is true that those who want to buy the plates , have rather unusual , and would like to spend some time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I drink not much .
this is my f@@ aster .
We@@ z , 25 , working at S@@ ister Ray , believes also that many customers who hits the You@@ Go@@ v profile .
however , he has also noticed a new wave of people who have influenced by the Medi@@ enh@@ pe , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and have set themselves to buy their old records .
for the convers@@ ations that I have conducted , people usually have escaped as of 1998 or 1999 of their collection .
customers who once sold their records to buy CDs , sell their CDs again , in order to buy their records , &quot; he says .
that would explain the boom of the record collector of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional meaning ?
it only takes some seconds in a business such as phon@@ ica , to recognize that record stores offers a s@@ oo@@ thing community of equ@@ ine inn@@ ings .
according to We@@ z , some of the older customers participated in the cont@@ act@@ less payment system .
some plate fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and would like to return to the stability of familiar sound quality env@@ elop@@ es , from objects that are happ@@ ier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it can be the col@@ t of a living or possession of material property than a kind of comfort , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says We@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is with me as a collector and I think it is so many people so .
it is a simple way to employ spiritu@@ ally .
&quot; we are like their social worker ! &quot; sol@@ uble a staff from a record stack .
a survey of IC@@ M revealed in April that almost 50 % of people who have purchased a record for the last month they have not heard .
the pol@@ l found out that 41 % have had a record player that they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record , have no record player .
at this time of the news report I would probably look very concerned while I bl@@ acks with a stack of Bos@@ sa Nova comp@@ il@@ ations .
J@@ onn@@ y , 42 , who has been working with the sounds of the Universe ( number of data : three men , middle @-@ aged men ) has noticed a &quot; t@@ rophy &quot; of the Re@@ vi@@ r@@ ens .
&quot; someone came just here , and said : &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player , but I would like to buy a radi@@ i sound plate , so that I can put it into the shelf , &quot; he says .
this is not a big percentage but it will definitely happen .
more productive reli@@ es , less musi@@ kl@@ es .
we have those who say : &quot; I have no record player . &quot;
these are younger people , not older who are just getting up slowly .
F@@ opp , dedicated to the Schall@@ platten ates almost one floor , has a b@@ lower audience as I go .
there are couples around 70 , tourists who make photos , teenagers and women aged aged .
even if the atmosphere is less relaxed than in the af@@ o@@ rem@@ enti@@ oned shops - Wild Be@@ ast is the latest syn@@ thes@@ ized and sex@@ t@@ ful pop instead of experiments - is it good to see such diversity in the customer .
none of them sees , especially lon@@ ely , but n@@ ag@@ mental trau@@ mat@@ a are bad@@ ly fixed , if you stand for 30 seconds next to someone .
El@@ an@@ ora , 27 , has been running in the business for a few minutes and considered the variety of plates available for sale .
it &apos;s more a man@@ nequ@@ in as a big one .
they deser@@ ves not much , therefore the collecting of records did not make any real option , says it .
it costs much .
it is easy to listen to music from a computer or other way , but the beauty of s@@ lab@@ s is ... &quot; it drives with a dar@@ ed epide@@ mic .
I do not know how to explain it - it is really unique .
my last stop is a shop that is said to have inspired a new generation of record @-@ lovers : urban out@@ fit@@ ters .
while I give the note that Je@@ ans Hot@@ p@@ ants watches , I observe a group of young teenagers who group@@ ed for one moment around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras , before a father and his daughter survived , a Cro@@ w record player .
on the left , there is a staircase , a wall full of records of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , Amy Win@@ eh@@ ouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a blend of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection .
nobody sees her - perhaps because they are only p@@ urely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to set her .
it is pure &quot; record art . &quot;
but considering that any attraction for these objects would mean more money for the industry , and some customers like to send the depths So@@ H@@ os for more , there is nothing to be chargeable to itself .
there is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others , which is , most suitable for deluxe objects such as lab@@ s .
even if my research projects showed that the results of You@@ Go@@ v , they leave , at least in place @-@ shops in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors and record lovers who exist in reality , record business and online in On@@ line@@ for@@ ums .
these people probably work hard in school or in offices .
they will spend their Thursday morning with security not covered by record stores of the Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves through records , while at the star@@ r@@ ushing glance at a glance , 30 @-@ year old false present@@ er , who gets nothing out of old men aged Middle @-@ old age .

French Court ref@@ uses an out@@ line from shops in the jung@@ le refugee camp .
a French court rejected one of the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jung@@ le of Cal@@ ais , living in the thousands of refugees living in the thousands of refugees .
the authorities argu@@ ed this week argu@@ ed the authorities in Cal@@ ais that the state should have jurisdiction to sell 72 pro@@ vision@@ aries to sell 72 pro@@ vision@@ aries , or sell tea services or tea for 50 cents ( 40 P@@ ence ) or a simple meals for a few Euros in temporary restaurants .
Cal@@ ais argu@@ ed that these places should be torn down in Cal@@ ais because they would represent a parallel economy that would not be paid by the tax and a risk @-@ risk .
humanitarian groups rated the court that the shops and restaurants are important as the free meals that are offered by the state @-@ supported association and other groups , not enough food for growing numbers in stock .
they also led out that the Pro@@ visional Business and Restaurants often would like to offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the exp@@ ulsion of people who continue to operate the 72 pro@@ vision@@ ist businesses , but have dre@@ amed that the concerns of Cal@@ ais pre@@ fecture are completely re@@ trac@@ table . &quot;
the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that the grocery stores , cafes , and restaurants would be playing a much bigger role as they live in extremely short @-@ natural conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas of peaceful meet between refugees and volunteers offer .

here comes the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
Germany &apos;s R@@ aser must be set to the next generation of velocity years : in various federal states , among other things in H@@ esse and Brandenburg , new flash devices will be tested particularly effective .
the fut@@ ur@@ istic @-@ acting En@@ forcement of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example to accidents on accidents , where it would be dangerous for mobile measurement by the police .
for example , on highway construction sites or to renov@@ ating bridges , there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure the speed limit@@ ing in the speed limit@@ ing .
a more durable mobile building can be too dangerous or complex .
the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler is autonomous : its battery holds five days un@@ interrupted measurement activity . the case data is transmitted via a modem .
using laser measurement technology , all vehicles can be recorded simultaneously through several tracks .
variable speed limit as well as cables according to the time , running strips and vehicle class are also able to monitor .
in highly frequ@@ ented condition , one can move the trailer according to the manufacturer with every car with trailer hit@@ ch .
in this way , it is not easily handled , it is lowered into the measurement mode , so the wheels in the pan@@ de@@ pot and by the way is van@@ ish even too .
furthermore a built @-@ in alarm system is designed to protect the gl@@ itter from V@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested and used in various federal states as well as in various federal states .
in addition , foreign authorities bl@@ asts with the new technique : recently , France has re@@ ordered 100 units , after an order of 150 pieces last year .
great Britain brings silver in 7 @-@ bit Rug@@ by , after joined Master@@ class Gold .
the impressive performance of Britain at the 7 @-@ day Rug@@ by came in the final on Thursday evening to a rup@@ ted stop at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were defeated in Rio with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at De@@ od@@ oro Stadium .
Fiji had a master class in the handling , side @-@ st@@ epp@@ ing , squ@@ ee@@ zing , liner and raw power to win gold - their first Olympics in any color .
the defeat was disp@@ at@@ ched through the silver medal of silver medal - Great Britain on this day - and they could definitely be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they struck New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the significant defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ final on the same day could fall back on them in the final .
but regardless of this , a 15 @-@ man team would have been defeated in the form of this form .
it might be a consol@@ ation for GB - but it is probably not that at least a bridge will hang a gold medal around his neck . Fi@@ j@@ is head coach Ben Ryan , the former head of England from Wimbledon .
GB had a difficult path behind .
eight years ago she was lost at Ryan every game in the Adelaide Sev@@ ens .
here they lost only one .
this piece is we@@ aving , but the progress is amazing .
Fiji had been wonderful and caused the GB@@ S attacks from Sp@@ ass .
it felt to the captain Tom Mitchell on and Co . , when you run in driving buses . the World Series winner went 5 @-@ 0 to top , when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au went over the corner .
with four minutes playing time , Jerry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack out of the right corner which he walked .
finally the ball has the ball for 12 @-@ 0 and GB .
a he@@ avi@@ est T@@ ack@@ le of Mitchell stops the mountain of Mann @-@ Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa a third goal , but the Fiji had not stopped .
in the seventh minute J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a arrived in the right corner a touch down and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new ever since its re @-@ fi@@ ff and there was still over a minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ v@@ ou are pre@@ di@@ pped by further weak hop@@ per of the GB teams and stor@@ med up to line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to rest .
it &apos;s like a Fiji had been born to play the 7 , while the GB are still to be picked .
so it is also .
GB introduced basic changes to half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ ic gap ... for all four minutes , which was good for the ratios of the first half @-@ time until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova ran after a brilliant di@@ play of Fiji .
Dan Norton launched an attempt to GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 but the game ended long in favour of the southern sulph@@ ate , whose fans sn@@ akes , flags til@@ ted and d@@ anced on the grand@@ stand .
it was not difficult to admire the recording of Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame set the i @-@ bag with another attempt in the last seconds .
the fi@@ ff ert@@ t@@ oned , the fi@@ j@@ is im@@ pover@@ ished and the GB are struck down and struck down in the lawn .
earlier on the day Fiji had defeated Japan in semi @-@ final with 20 @-@ 5 defeated and the UK South Africa hit the difference in a kno@@ b match from the race - Great Britain &apos;s conversion .
K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ats in the first half of the front , but Dan Norton broke out the line with an impressive foot@@ work and achieved a fool under the post in the second half .
a brilliant late t@@ ack@@ ling of Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of English 15 @-@ A@@ side teams , assured the win - and thus the silver medal .
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by the fight with the cancer of the trainer for rowing victory
there will be no bi@@ ode@@ ficiency gold as with these games and that will be hot .
from the first rowing until the last , 220 hard H@@ ieve that enter in history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional significance in their golden moment on Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even though there were only those who were sitting on the Ru@@ ins , there were three voices in the boat . the Echo of the trainer Robin Williams , was present always at the second Olympi@@ ad in a row , the first women in the history of British Sports , which gave such a scale .
your domin@@ ance was absolute , after all of all her 3@@ 9.@@ ter is unbe@@ ar@@ able .
what we can see are two brilliant artists who lead over the surface with the elegance of swe@@ eping things , which reflects not the kind of triumph@@ s on ge@@ ze .
behind every gold in the rowing , a Bat@@ ail@@ lon will contribute to the distinction that make the difference , and there was no hel@@ pl@@ ess than the trainer , who was not able to survive this day when he was diagnosed with cancer .
as he said he ris@@ ky .
I had bladder cancer , which is oper@@ able and they did .
if you do not do that , he spreads out everywhere .
it would have been pretty worse situation .
it changes a little the view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio had luck that he could be the treatment in early 2014 , out of season , could start what the inter@@ ruption to a minimum , in case the proper term is at all .
I needed money , therefore I needed to go better again soon .
it was a inc@@ enti@@ ve .
I was in hospital and ran at the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough .
so it begins .
the rowing to itself is a challenge , but that makes it a bigger one .
in the Im@@ medi@@ a@@ view of the victory went their first thoughts on Williams , who had a ner@@ ve morning to speak a little more than otherwise and tried to process his own fears .
St@@ anning , which was the cent@@ ur@@ ion at the Royal Art@@ illery Reg@@ iment in an action in Afghanistan , &quot; I was this week an emotional wre@@ ck . that &apos;s perhaps something extremely rare , but it means so much . &quot;
it is only repeated that how much I and Helen and Helen have been working with Robin .
there were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
without Robin , we are no one , therefore a massive thank you to him . he is the best coach of the world .
I would like to wish I have a better person for trainer or better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning lost no race in the last five years .
the pair had a hard rhythm with which their opponent could not keep up .
even during the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to close , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve .
we were at the moment .
Helen called &quot; lead in the process , lead in the process . &quot;
it is really important to catch oneself away .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not going to make something Tol@@ les .
we wanted no fire@@ works today , we wanted to achieve a good result , going out and win the race , which we did .
the pair will take for one year before it will make decisions about his future .
Glo@@ ver must appear next week at a wedding , their own with the TV adventure Steve Back@@ shall .
just want to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that my last race was .
that would have too much pressure .
in London it took about six months to realize that I am an Olympic champion .
it was all so new to me and I was so stressed .
here it took about four minutes .
so much better to , &quot; she said .
31 years of exempl@@ ary for clarity :
the managing director of the &quot; V@@ eit@@ s group &quot; group , R@@ upper@@ t G@@ öller , will reti@@ re .
the association is considered as a &quot; Bavarian capital . &quot;
a small har@@ sh drinking water @-@ purpose association as an example of the large water@@ producer .
so there was some time ago in the original Fl@@ alt@@ on in a post of the Bavarian Radio .
a little later the water forum of the government of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia followed the two @-@ wing association .
the work of the V@@ eit@@ s group sailed in Bavarian as exempl@@ ary . &quot;
behind all this Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who was 31 years in the two @-@ association employee , 28 years ago as managing director .
now he was retired at the age of 65 .
the pot@@ able water @-@ purpose organization with headquarters in K@@ ott@@ endorf , Municipality of Breit@@ brunn , promotes about 15@@ 0000 cubic meters of water and supplies 32 places and ham@@ let with about 5500 inhabitants .
affili@@ ates are the churches of Kirch@@ alle , Breit@@ brunn , a loud , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the town of Ba@@ un@@ ach .
there are water supply agreements for further cities and municipalities .
the current president , Breit@@ brun@@ d Büh@@ l ( FW ) , rec@@ alled that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was hired as a water@@ way back in 1985 and was named as Managing Director of the Association of Pur@@ su@@ ck in 1988 .
&quot; its tasks are very multi@@ fac@@ eted , and has been extended from water management and maintenance of office and organiz@@ ational activities , the budget , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency contracts at weekends , &quot; said the chairman .
as outstanding events they called the commissioning and inauguration of the new well ( 1994 ) , property purchases in the area of the New Fo@@ unt@@ ain ( 1998 ) and compensation of farmers , the re@@ building of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the mit@@ re of a central computer control ( 2004 ) .
I have not given a stand@@ still , and have always recorded innovations , because waters may cover lives and drinking water is the most important food .
in her Lau@@ d@@ ati@@ o , they praised G@@ öl@@ lers , reliable and correct service over 31 years .
he has worked with lots of heart bloody for his water @-@ purpose association and he lived in the water @-@ purpose association , as if it had its own company .
a few weeks ago , he was regarded as a real traine@@ e to present the success of the V@@ eit@@ s group to the nit@@ rate reduction in front of the water@@ forum of the Unter@@ fran@@ ken District .
he has received very much recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öller s@@ former praised waterfalls Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who had worked together with him for 28 years .
he is the best water and he was a faithful kne@@ aded .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
in the highlights from his point of view , he called the Brun@@ nen@@ bau and the Re@@ structured Association of Pur@@ pose .
but the most difficult challenge and the most difficult application , however , the bur@@ gl@@ ary of the church was on a 3rd of January .
here we had to work at minus 17 degrees the whole night , so that the villages could be supplied with water .
also the supply of Neu@@ brunn can only be kept only , because you filled the can@@ ister of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses .
the management of the drinking water @-@ purpose association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer , who joins from Ru@@ pert G@@ öller .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the competent police in Lübeck initially did not make any information on the d@@ ashing and the relationship between perpet@@ rators and victims , but confirmed that a man had been killed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is an aut@@ um@@ ber delicate . &quot;
&quot; more recently , we &apos;re not saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one polishing winner in Lübeck . &quot; &quot; &quot;

steel - light sight for German steel industry
the cra@@ ck explo@@ ited and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains un@@ spar@@ ed by additional cost in millions .
financial bur@@ dens , which threatened by the industry from the oil @-@ current funding , are from the table .
it remains at the liberation of Renewable Energi@@ es in the inventory of the so @-@ called self @-@ electricity production in the German steel industry , said Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Fre@@ it@@ ag@@ issue ) .
&quot; I &apos;m really happy about that we could finally reach the negotiations after two years . &quot;
according to the European Commission , the European Commission is initially planned to use steel producers , which make gases up from the high @-@ furnace electricity generation to checkout .
the steel industry dro@@ pping additional costs from 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , it has now been a principle of conformity with the EU Commission for talks with the un@@ miss@@ ile Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only when alter@@ nat@@ ors in the steel works are replaced , all an EEG conversion of 20 per cent .
but these will not be collected in the steel sector .
IG Metall successfully gre@@ eted the unification of Germany with the EU Commission for self @-@ energy production .
with that , the status qu@@ o was largely updated to the previous rule .
special significance was the successful adoption of Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in regard to our Camp@@ a@@ ign &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; steel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the first step &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; others must follow . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also at the reform of the emission allow@@ ances are climate and employment targets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains IG Metall @-@ CEO Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has been suffering from the financial crisis of 2008 under over@@ capacities and a significant price pressure .
last year , the situation intensi@@ fied , when the world &apos;s largest producer in China developed the global market in view of the global market .
European manufacturers t@@ oss Chinese steel companies price du@@ mp@@ ing .
in the course of this spring , the situation has something relaxed .
for example , import@@ ation tari@@ ffs on imported steel effect , for example , economic prospects in China have been cut off .
it is un@@ clear how sustainable the price over@@ h@@ aul is .
the German industry @-@ pri@@ m Thys@@ sen@@ Krupp was c@@ auti@@ ous on Thursday .
recently the prices were more stag@@ n@@ ating .
the sector respon@@ ds to the difficult situation of further cost reductions .
Thys@@ sen@@ Krupp ultimately wanted to do not closing the closure of individual works .
in the German steel industry around 86@@ ,000 people were employed at the end of 2015 .
in July , the German steel producer remain careful despite rising prices and increasing orders .
they produced 3.4 million tons well over six percent less cru@@ de steel , as in the previous year &apos;s month , as the Steel Association ruled on Friday .
after a short increase in May the amount now returned for the second month .
since the beginning of the year , production is set by two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure .
the association calcul@@ ates in the coming months thanks to an improved order situation with increasing emissions .
fellowship , Spirit , health : sing pra@@ ises to the elderly
Ur@@ sel K@@ ipp already accompanied their whole life : as a young girl she was in the school choir , in the course of teaching music , and today she sings the 78 @-@ year @-@ old in a senior choir .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; singing me - emotional and physical &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she describes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a sample she feels balanced , cheer@@ ful and living in total , she says .
at the same time , she is doing something good in her health and her spirit .
for singing is like from several perspectives a great hob@@ by for seniors , says Erhard Hack@@ ers from the German senior League .
the majority of the elderly people sing in the choir and equ@@ alize the joy of music , describes h@@ ack@@ ler .
through regular inter@@ ventions , senior social contacts can combine and maintain .
for often , social and family structures often solve , one choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
this experience has also made Ur@@ sel K@@ ipp in their chor@@ us : &quot; to meet and organize themselves , to learn and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of the compositions . &quot;
singing in the positive sense , h@@ ack@@ ler refers .
because the senior citizens exercise a deep and controlled breathing .
those who calls his l@@ ungs regularly calls for daily life in everyday life as quickly out of the pu@@ rest .
even if it goes to get the sound of the voice at the age , S@@ ingen is an optimal hob@@ by .
for older people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the federal employment community of the senior citizens .
in the older generations the shared sin@@ ingen had a much higher importance , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and leisure , explains it .
L@@ enz often observed that singing or hearing from songs with older people w@@ akes many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth .
with lyrics and especially tun@@ es themselves ende@@ mic to deteri@@ or@@ ated people on a long time .
in addition , at the head a special achievement is required , L@@ enz stated .
at the same time , at the same time , concentrate on their own voice and to fit the other singers - this is a great cogn@@ itive challenge .
just elderly people who live alone and do not only focus on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition , that travels across the choir in the choir h@@ ack@@ ler .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ est@@ e@@ em is also growing by singing in the choir .
themselves to show yourself : if I &apos;m long for anything , I &apos;ll get better and watch over me - this experience strengthens .
good reasons to start with singing , there is enough enough .
whoever wants to try a new hob@@ by , should not hesitate ; even if he writes , little talent , av@@ eng@@ ed L@@ enz .
you don &apos;t sing alone - at 50 singing people , who hears there though once a sound is going to go ?
in search of a suitable offer , seniors have various possibilities , says h@@ ack@@ ler .
does anyone sing from a strange woman in an un@@ n@@ ench@@ ant@@ or , one can simply connect .
many cities also offer views of choirs in the vicinity .
who like to sing in an ec@@ cl@@ esi@@ ast@@ ical choir may directly turn to the church or church pre@@ sidents .
many senior choirs can also be found via the Internet .
if you have access to the Internet , the family , friends or neigh@@ bors could ask help with Internet access .
those who want to want to sing , shou@@ ldn &apos;t be connected to a chor@@ us , sl@@ anted h@@ ack@@ ler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sing the soul well , and has something good thing - this is valid for every age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
cats respond to sen@@ si@@ bler than cr@@ aters on the young of the young
biolog@@ ists studied in Hannover , which effect the rowing from cat &apos;s parties on adult animals .
for her surprise , the mist@@ ress did not get cold - but they beha@@ ved in the difference to the females always .
female cats may know the ra@@ iny of K@@ atz@@ enb@@ ab@@ ys in the mist@@ rust of the little ones .
they react ten percent faster to Lau@@ te of k@@ itt@@ ens which chose out in great troub@@ les , such as scientists from the veterinary university and the Medical School of Hannover ( MH@@ H ) .
cr@@ aters also respond to the rest of k@@ itt@@ ens - but still the same .
&quot; evi@@ d@@ ently , the acou@@ st@@ ical differences between the mist@@ rust of less and severely dam@@ ned young for the males are either perc@@ ep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; said the Bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding from the MH@@ H .
it is the first author@@ itative study published on this Friday in the journal BM@@ C Evol@@ u@@ tionary Biology . &quot;
in a previous examination the research team had already found out that duration and pitch of k@@ itt@@ ens with the ur@@ gency of their help needs .
in total , nine adult hang@@ ers and eight kit@@ es were observed from the livestock of the MH@@ H .
they were played for a little ones of little ones who were taken for three minutes from the saus@@ age box and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
for others , they were con@@ fron@@ ted with scre@@ ams of stronger k@@ itt@@ ens , which were lifted in addition .
the researchers keep their results despite the small sample for meaning@@ ful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every female , even those who had no one of his own offspring , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it turned out faster to the speakers , if this ru@@ ff has played very well as the k@@ itt@@ ens .
this ability may be born or developed with the sexually mature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a surprise was that the male had re@@ acted at all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Bi@@ olog@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past , scientists have already studied the reactions of women and men in baby noise .
some studies show that women are sensitive to su@@ ck@@ lings , all of them mothers or not , reported the Bi@@ olog@@ ica Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann .
Po@@ dol@@ ski does with &quot; Gala &quot; to Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sou@@ k@@ r is a soccer legend in Turkey .
a warrant for an arrest warrant was issued in Turkey in Turkey .
he is accused of being a member of the terrorist group .
the first attempt in Turkey will take place an important soccer game for the first time in Turkey .
before the du@@ el of the patri@@ cian between Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ fo Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul around the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya is the official line unique : &quot; business as usual &quot; has been announced .
already with the susp@@ ending of the acceptance test in July , the government , which should not be imp@@ aired by normal brush@@ ing , should not be imp@@ aired .
but this does not apply to those who are suspected , the movement of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len will be responsible for the coup attempt .
even before the soccer you do not work .
the Pro@@ sec@@ ution filed an arrest warrant against the earlier star@@ ters Hak@@ an Sou@@ mor@@ r .
the company is therefore accused of being a member of a terrorist group in the Americas .
Sü@@ l@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len shall be responsible for the coup attempt by President Recep Tayyip Erd@@ og@@ an , president of President Recep Tayyip Erd@@ og@@ an .
indeed , initially for 90 days , it was still valid until October , indeed , however , the life of most Turks did not affect the life of most Turks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the n@@ igh@@ tly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy gu@@ ards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in public places in the whole country has been declared ground on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is - like all the country - split into pendant and opponent of Erd@@ og@@ an .
traditionally , fans of the working club Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as do not count to the friends of the president .
but what the Gro@@ s of the Turks cried out in view of dramatic experience in history , strict adher@@ ence of military cou@@ p@@ utsch@@ es .
there &apos;s even the fans - no matter whether their heart beat for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at Pok@@ al@@ winner &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will definitely be back to Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
its sporting value presented in Cologne in the past season : with 17 gates and nine templates in all con@@ tests , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old ended his first playing time as Top@@ sc@@ orer of his association .
on the final match against F@@ ener@@ b@@ ah@@ ach@@ ers , he scored the 1 : 0 victory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fan@@ atics &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rejoiced : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured the t@@ rophy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dis@@ appointing season for the record master took a sound conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the round @-@ cat@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; lions &quot; emerged also in the Europe League earlier .
in the south of Li@@ g , it was only att@@ ained to rank 6 .
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we made it and this is the most important thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for master Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as , the year was better .
especially thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who made the basis for the 14th title thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who put the base on the 14th title with 26 season .
this is also the reason that fans hope to return to the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
following the coup attempt at the AC Florence , the AC Florence was posted on self @-@ drawn Gom@@ ez after the coup attempt to return on due to the political situation in the country after its EM @-@ holiday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Mario would like to come to us , he must say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ icker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ icker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; club@@ teams F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this , the stor@@ ms would have to give up around one @-@ third of its worth EUR 7.5 million an estimated annual sal@@ ads , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Or@@ man said clearly : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; its content of Florence can &apos;t pay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite D@@ oping : these athletes still have medals opportunities at Olympia in Rio

Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ owa may not start in Rio .
other surviving Athletics Men can laugh about it - they fight for Rio to medals .
the topic of D@@ oping is determined as before the head@@ lines in the Rio Olympics Games .
the Russian swimming pool Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ owa , which was compl@@ ained after a D@@ oping @-@ Sper@@ m in front of the games , has been cheer@@ ful and hat@@ ched at their start ( 100 meters breast ) .
there was a sc@@ ur@@ r@@ ile Sz@@ ener@@ ie : with a broken smile , she was still in the hall and prov@@ okes with her presence .
when it was established that they won &apos;t take gold , the audience broke out in a jub@@ ilee .
but there are many other sport@@ s@@ men who want to start in the Rio Olympics despite D@@ oping @-@ past .
here an overview :
Just@@ in Gat@@ line ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 m season / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old belongs to the most controversi@@ al figures in the Athletics Men .
he had been closed two times for D@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
since his B@@ ann the Olympic champion in 2004 and ex @-@ world champion runs even faster than before , he is over 100 m in 9,@@ 80 seconds the number one in the world and is considered as the largest chall@@ enger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 m season / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven times world champion in 2010 had to finish a six @-@ month sper@@ son after you have been demonstrated by taking the pain of Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don .
after an operation , she def@@ ends strong t@@ ooth@@ ache , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old def@@ ended .
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Dis@@ cus / Croatia ) : in 2011 , the Olympic champion of 2012 , world champion in 2013 and European championships has been positi@@ vely tested for meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amine in 2013 and European Champion from 2010 to 2016 .
Per@@ kovic denied the sent@@ ee administration and was closed for six months .
the four most broad@@ est lit@@ ters will go to the account of the big gold f@@ lap .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 m season / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic champion and two @-@ time World Champion over 400 m was closed in 2010 and has been closed for 21 months .
as a result of penis enlargement , was responsible , stri@@ ated Mer@@ ritt .
this year the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is over 200 and 400 metres of the world &apos;s fastest man .
I@@ wan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer@@ ion , Belarus ) : hardly any athletes have been recognized as many medals .
thus in 2005 , T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title of nine years later , after it has been diagnosed with test@@ oster@@ one D@@ oping .
the meanwhile 40 @-@ year @-@ old had to give the Olympia @-@ D@@ op@@ ings in 2004 for ster@@ oid arthritis and the EM @-@ tracks 2006 for test@@ oster@@ one abuse .
he was also recognized as a bronze medal for the 2008 Olympic Games , based on a ruling by the International Sport Court of Justice CA@@ S .
with 8@@ 0,@@ 04 m he is ranked in two of the world @-@ ranking list .
Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walk , China ) : the world championship and Gold@@ favorites had only been positive in May , but still in Rio .
when the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world Championships were found inten@@ tionally by taking a banned food supplement , the sperm cells in the world anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency WA@@ DA fell mild and ran already on July 13th .
Bom@@ k@@ ite error in Thailand - Austri@@ ans viol@@ ated - more multiple deaths
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand stand with the woman in contact , said the spokes@@ man for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ eller , Fre@@ it@@ ag@@ early .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had suffered chi@@ ves and had been treated in the hospital , but this is already left to leave . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
her hom@@ ebo@@ und journey was planned for the beginning of September .
whether from other explo@@ sions on holiday island Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ erk@@ on also Austrian citizens are still un@@ clear .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs arise in favor of a medium contact with local authorities , as a bul@@ ls .
at around 200 kilometres south of the capital of Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in were initially explo@@ ded on Thursday evening in a b@@ lown quarter of two bombs .
according to the police , a Tha@@ il@@ iter was killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans .
again , Fre@@ it@@ ag@@ early then entered two jumps on high , thereby , according to the authorities , a further human being killed .
also from Ph@@ u@@ ket was reported in the morning a bomb explo@@ de .
by the Det@@ onation in the popular resort Pat@@ ong district , a taxi driver has been viol@@ ated near the det@@ onation of popular bath@@ ers in Pat@@ ong .
at Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ east coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded , which killed an urban company .
according to the authorities , the Spr@@ eng@@ ul@@ ls had gone up in a flower before the prec@@ inct of coastal police into the air .
finally , Det@@ on@@ ations resulted in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast and in Ch@@ erk@@ on on the south @-@ east coast , several convic@@ tions .
you walk from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , named it .
&quot; the bomb attack carry out the same manuscript , &quot; said Army General Dan@@ ai crit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Fre@@ it@@ ag@@ early in front of journalists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume that it is a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is too early to express itself on possible moti@@ ves - probably do not handle the deeds of Muslim reb@@ els . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even Thai media wanted to recognize a pattern regarding the attacks , which is typical for the bombing of the country mus@@ li@@ ous separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
on the other hand , the Thai police declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islamic movement movement or with the international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is just local Sab@@ ot@@ age that limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rather , I go rather that the bombs of bombs were laid down by the ruling military j@@ unta .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past few days , the authorities have received secret evidence for the coming attacks in the South of the country - but they don &apos;t have been informed about the exact date and place . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , be un@@ clear , a group behind the attacks .
the police demonstrated its civil servants to strengthen the security about important government buildings and airports , railway stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment area .
in Thailand there are always smaller bombing attacks , but they do not judge for tourists .
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace that was used over the years of Tha@@ il@@ ar king B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
after a more exciting bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Foreign Ministry recommends the Austrian Foreign Ministry on its homepage to make the instructions of the Thai Security Auth@@ orities .
high level of safety ( security level 3 ) sailed for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as pre@@ ah vi@@ ar and surroundings .
according to disputes between security forces and Muslim popul@@ ations , there is not necessary journeys in these provinces .
increased safety risk ( safety level 2 ) sailed for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday was at a few days after a controversi@@ al referendum on a Constitution of the military j@@ unta .
this spatial influence in the Military was also an influence in the years ago .
Jun@@ ta CEO and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Chan @-@ o @-@ CH@@ A said that bombs had been a try to fight chaos during the country toward stability , an improvement of economic situation and tourism .
the military j@@ unta , which had taken power in 2014 after a phase of bloody un@@ rest , resi@@ sts itself to att@@ ain the kingdom to stability and order .
however , it has not been able to get the military since years in the extreme south of the country , the insur@@ rection of mus@@ li@@ ous reb@@ els in the handle .
more than 500 people were killed in the conflict .
nearly one year ago in Bangkok at an attack on a popular Hin@@ du @-@ Sch@@ p@@ urely had killed 20 people - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloody beginnings of the younger history of the country .
the right &quot; identity movement &quot; is not at the visor of the Federal Office of Constitutional Protection .
after several regional offices , the constitutional complaints in the Federation have provided the group under observation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we look at the &apos; Identity Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for aspir@@ ations against the freedom of democratic principles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said constitutional protection Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate the German press agency in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this will diffuse Islamic faith or from the Near East in extrem@@ ist way diffuse .
therefore we observe the movement now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is turned towards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mul@@ tiv@@ al W@@ ahn &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; un@@ controlled mass migration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; loss of his own identity through &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Constitutional Prot@@ ector in Nine West countries - Bremen , Bavaria , H@@ esse , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thuring@@ ia - observe the &quot; ident@@ ities . &quot;
Ma@@ ate said , his authority ass@@ essing the decision to be closely involved with the authorities .
&quot; groups such as the &apos; identity movement &apos; try to pick their target group , where it stands , &quot; said the constitutional protection .
generally , try extrem@@ ists to talk with you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music .
the Islam@@ ist Islam@@ ists as well as jur@@ ist trem@@ ors .
that is not an unt@@ ary advertising for your own thing .
prop@@ aganda shall be emotional to people .
young people are due in a particular way .
this is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; most recently it had given documents about contacts of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Identity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Af@@ D politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ ate said , I have no knowledge .
possible contacts of this type are only relevant for the constitutional protection .
it depends on whether the respective party - in this case the Af@@ D - by certain people , the extrem@@ ist , change their target and is so extreme .
so , if such persons controlled their influence on the party .
this is no visible .
with a view to the significant increase of legal b@@ og@@ ents and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugee accommodations , Ma@@ ate , he would not speak of new right terrorism in this context .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we have found the last years that there can be legal im@@ perfec@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Fre@@ it@@ aler Group .
it can be quite a fact that other propri@@ etary groups or small groups form the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee eggs or attacks from other right wing extre@@ mes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inspec@@ torate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but are not recogni@@ z@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the previous groups were originated at regional level or social networks .
concerned , Ma@@ ate about that many en@@ cro@@ ach@@ ments went to the account of people who didn &apos;t have occurred in the right scene in the sight .
this is the concern .
many of the facts before attacks on asylum seek@@ ers are not as crime , polit@@ ically motiv@@ ated off@@ ences or tra@@ ilers of the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so many people have committed pen@@ alties , who had no effect on the hat before , who were perhaps elected to polit@@ ically in@@ different , or for example CD@@ U , SPD or Lin@@ ke , who , however , have become radi@@ alis@@ ing in force . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

accidents - bus sli@@ pped in cr@@ ashes in tr@@ ench : eight Ver@@ sions
when an accident of 43 seniors was injured as passengers , on Thursday in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ tr@@ n ( County Aur@@ i ) injured eight people .
two of the occup@@ ants suffered severe injuries , the police have divided .
the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach needed to make their dis@@ closures according to the opposite le@@ aster , partly on the run@@ way .
the bus came to the right from the road and sli@@ pped in a tr@@ ench , like a female speaker named Aur@@ i / Witt@@ mund .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the location of the bus , the persons could not rely on the bus , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire brig@@ ade delivered the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ance and emergency trol@@ ley came to the accident at Landes@@ straße 2 .
the last trip were brought back from a liner bus to the crow@@ um@@ m@@ ist district of P@@ ew@@ sum .
there they should wait for a replacement bus of the journey .

the fees per cubic meters of waste water will be between 1 October 2016 for the area of se@@ wage system Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / World Council 3.@@ 44 Euro ; for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ denberg / L@@ opp 3,@@ 36 Euro ( previously : 2,@@ 26 Euro ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 18 euros ) .
by the plant in Az@@ endorf , the se@@ wage cost will then increase once again when corresponding improvement measures will be necessary .
following a relevant calculation , the se@@ wage price in Az@@ endorf will then lie at 4,@@ 37 euros per cubic meter .
as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , was identified during the approval of the household by the land@@ lord of Kul@@ mb@@ ach that for these san@@ itation systems .
due to the legal basics , the Kas@@ endorf is oblig@@ ated to operate the facilities free of charge .
from October 1 , 2016 the citizens and industrial companies from Wel@@ ch@@ enko , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ opp , Lin@@ endorf , Lin@@ endorf , Lin@@ endorf , Lin@@ endorf , Lin@@ endorf , Lin@@ denberg , Lin@@ denberg , Lin@@ denberg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg .
the commission income ranges between 48 and 67 percent .
as Head of Head of Herbert Schmidt on the board , a new cal@@ ori@@ ent of the fees for the se@@ wage system of the market leaders was necessary .
during the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over and / or sub @-@ discover@@ ies origin@@ ating from the previous feed period .
the gra@@ iny stir@@ r@@ ers founded Schmidt thus with all three se@@ wage systems for relatively small se@@ wage treatment with a very low se@@ wage he@@ el , which fly between 6@@ 800 and 12000 cubic metres per year .
for example , due to the low distribution basis , expenses for the necessary repairs of several thousand Euros will be engraved on .
in addition , the se@@ wage increases slightly in all three plants .
furthermore , during all three plants are not least because of their age , research and repair expenses were incur@@ red in a considerable extent .
the plant in Az@@ endorf is almost 30 years old , the facilities for space &apos;s pole , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ denberg and L@@ opp .
in Schmidt it proved that Az@@ endorf the az@@ endorf wast@@ ew@@ ater treatment plant had to be exchanged due to damage .
in the p@@ umping station which is to be over@@ hau@@ led , almost 20 years old conveyor systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led and during the pond water reservoir , the Kl@@ är@@ s@@ lu@@ dge had to be installed and an additional ventilation can be installed in order to keep the water regulations in future .
Schmidt : &quot; to these extraordinary expenditure , the continued care and maintenance costs came into account in accordance with the new calcul@@ ator period . &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs which occur in the previous level of current calculation in the years 2011 / 2012 .
in fact , stone houses made clear that at low se@@ wage agreement in the three plants the expenditure for the operation and maintenance must hit &quot; full through . &quot;
in addition , Schmidt , the market leaders of large entertainment costs in the past 20 years has been spar@@ ed .
the situation for the af@@ o@@ rem@@ enti@@ oned facilities will continue to remain pre@@ fecture , especially since one could not expand the supply of the wast@@ ew@@ age Association of Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ acht@@ al around these plants , because it is a qualified institutions .

the annual average temperature of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured by the C@@ PI -@@ 0.8 % .
the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0 % .

Snap@@ chat &quot; An@@ ime &quot; -@@ Effect as Asian cartoon critic@@ ized
Snap@@ chat says that this filter is An@@ ime @-@ inspired , but some ob@@ servers say that it is un@@ sensitive to breeds .
with his filter tool , it allows up to change over 150 million day trips to change reality and to play with ident@@ ities in such a way which already borders the ab@@ sur@@ d .
you can walk to p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Licht@@ enstein of paintings .
the filters are un@@ bl@@ oss@@ om , autonomous turn@@ able tools that generate more than 30 million more sel@@ ector per day .
all undes@@ irable missions will be to the public .
in the past , the app @-@ called Black@@ face @-@ filters or white skin were prop@@ ag@@ ated as beauty ideal for the app .
when this week , some signs struck a filter , which gave them sl@@ itz@@ ky , false teeth , and in@@ numer@@ able che@@ eks , there were some critics a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; diamonds . &quot;
they asked if this repet@@ itive contro@@ vers@@ y came to a larger problem that the company has with diversity .
the news and the indig@@ nation were widespread in Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mother@@ board , one day after Snap@@ chat , that it would have disabled the feature .
the company offered an exc@@ use : the filter was thought as an homage to An@@ ime characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asia .
but out @-@ out , the R@@ ass@@ is@@ sm@@ us have experienced , rec@@ alled the filter to viol@@ ate clari@@ fication .
other rejected the An@@ ime comparison .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an e @-@ mail , Grace as@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean American art student , whose T@@ we@@ et were widespread over the photos that the filter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; infr@@ in@@ gement and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was un@@ pleasant &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they added that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult with the counter@@ part of a highly controversi@@ al Asian cartoon and the filter effects . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it shows that the filter is not sigh@@ ted , but that the yellow face was pulled down in the extreme extre@@ mes .
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that it crosses the cultural pride .
the American culture seems to be involved in endless diversity and integration courses , of conference spaces up to Hollywood and the equipment that we all keep in hand .
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats large audience of young people - the things in terms of race , more than their older opponents - may be expected more likely to expect awareness @-@ compatibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if one of snap@@ shots is a picture , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is much more difficult that such things remains un@@ noticed when it was the case , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the 25 @-@ year old K@@ atie Zh@@ u said in an interview on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Zh@@ u decided to work as a product manager and engineering in medium , their Snap@@ chat account has to er@@ ase another to do the same .
in an ess@@ ay for medium and in a telephone interview she said that they believe , ins@@ ul@@ c@@ ous contro@@ vers@@ y had been reflected by a lack of di@@ vest@@ ry at the snap@@ shots .
Zh@@ u crit@@ ically critic@@ ized the great part of white , only male leadership and terminated its ess@@ ay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either I have no different representation of people with other skin colors , so that they can make such decisions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the chin@@ i @-@ American Zh@@ u , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they &apos;re working with other skin colors that they work there , but not in positions to tell what it seems to say . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint , the Snap@@ chat is mostly left un@@ answered .
the company hasn &apos;t released no numbers to di@@ vest@@ ments of its workforce and indicates its status as a private company .
on Thursday , the Snap@@ chat talks to discuss the cultural back@@ grounds of his staff , but according to a speaker , the company recently decided to focus a staff responsible for sub@@ trac@@ ted population groups and internal integration efforts .
Zh@@ u said in its part , that she will be closed their Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that it is not O.@@ K. . &quot;
military Management over IS@@ IS Secret service information , presents Committee of Congress
military @-@ affiliated to the United States Central Command has changed its registration information to draw a optim@@ istic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , as it had permitted the actual states on site in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a task force of Republi@@ can members of the armed forces , secret services and the Wehr@@ bud@@ get@@ ic , reported by great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command intelligence agencies , reported that he changed their inv@@ alu@@ ation in the struggle against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , shortly C@@ en@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida to control the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; news service information that were typical of high @-@ level Cent@@ Com Com@@ man@@ ders typically have been sent regularly on a regular picture of the U.S. efforts against terrorism , and were consistently positive as analyses of other news services , &quot; quoted newspaper article the report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened to Cent@@ Com is un@@ acceptable - our soldiers suffer , if bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ken Cal@@ vert , republi@@ can member of the House of Represent@@ atives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the leadership errors in Cent@@ Com goes up to the top point of the organisation .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in descriptions and analysis of American efforts in the formation of Iraqi forces .
although there is no direct indications that we have given the government peaks under Obama , it shows how anal@@ ysts looked after the pressure of their fore@@ seen , an optim@@ istic picture from the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or I@@ si@@ l .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , comments and statements of the Congress clearly stated in the facts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; presented the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Cent@@ Com members admitted publicly that there could be a military re@@ conquest Mos@@ sul@@ s already in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , second @-@ largest city of Iraq remains under the Islamic state control .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after months of investigations , this is much clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , republi@@ can con@@ gresses from Kansas , in a position statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the middle of 2014 until the middle of 2015 , the Sp@@ itz of Central Command changed the subsequent reports to play the risk by IS@@ IS in Iraq .
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans called the Task Force , after them had been dealt with them that anal@@ ysts did not worry about manip@@ ulation to the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed insights during investigations .
in addition , further investigations of Cent@@ Com reports are included in the Secretary @-@ General of the Ministry of Defense .
the majority of their findings published on Thursday , on Thursday , published their own knowledge , with some of the conclusions adopted in the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; Cent@@ Com voted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cent@@ Com for the preparation of subsequent inv@@ alu@@ ations on I@@ si@@ l and the Iraqi security services , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave the t@@ allest Democrat on the compass , member of the House of Represent@@ atives &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Adam B. &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this process , as Mr. ship , delayed the publication of subsequent reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Mor@@ al under anal@@ ysts and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were relatively little space for different opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Mr. Schiff and Democrats gave no information on an intervention of the white house at Cent@@ Com anal@@ ysts regarding a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; specific political opinion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the preliminary results of the Congress were published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast &quot; .
last August , the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon &apos;s major inspec@@ tions that were admitted to complaints by Cent@@ Com anal@@ ysts .
according to C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Evans , a press prize of the Pentagon , issued in a statement that the Ministry of Defence had no reports of Congress , while the investigation of the General Assembly was still underway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he also answered that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts can be quite di@@ verg@@ ent opinions concerning the interpretation of complex data , and that the news services and the Ministry of Defence welcomed a controversi@@ al discussion on these important topics of the national defence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the investigation on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion that is now made by an increasing number of members of the Ministry of Defence ) .
however , the alleg@@ ations of the past year however , however , submitted the question to what President Obama can rely on the Central Command for hon@@ est estimates of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criticism of the Islamic State remin@@ ded over ten years ago as a Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st , Gregory Hoo@@ ker , a character piece about the evidence of many anal@@ ysts just a small occupying troops in Iraq and a little time on it , about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 thought .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the insur@@ rection against the current reporting of the Islamic State .
last year , the team presents Mr. Hoo@@ kers according to speci@@ fying government officials , that contrary to the statements of the government suffered no significant effects on the financial situation of the terrorist group , as these pro@@ vision@@ ally refin@@ eries had been put into operation to sell oil on the black market .
however , this realization was not published , the Times in September .
Cent@@ rec@@ de dam@@ al@@ iger commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was am@@ eral by members of the unic@@ am@@ eral assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate .
General Austin went into retirement in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the U.S. gain fourth match in the field ho@@ ckey of women , show@@ down show@@ down with Britain before
one day after it had shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two gates for the American Feld@@ ho@@ ckey team of women in a match against India that Americans won the American with 3 @-@ 0 .
five gates in two games should actually mean a memor@@ able performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said , she could not remember that ever done .
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I don &apos;t belong to the people that keep their gates in memory .
however , this knows it : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition , and they are equally suited to the British in their first place , which remains unbe@@ aten to Japan after their 2 @-@ 0 victory .
great Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last lap of the first round .
both teams are already qualified for the quarter final , the game will decide which the two will gain each of the first and second place within their group .
the first @-@ space fin@@ isher will go a bit longer from the path that lead the other group .
as always , the game may go out in Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprise @-@ story , four years after the last London Games took place on the last of 12 places .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania . for the first time he played a Ho@@ ck@@ ey@@ ra@@ cket in hands ( their two older sisters played the sport at Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years old , she became the youngest player in the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
you missed the Olympi@@ ad in 2008 , because they didn &apos;t qualify for the buyer .
then came the year 2012 , in which for her and her team went away everything .
in the following year , Craig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , trainer of the National Team and thereby began the things to turn better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a cultural change , an mental change and physical change , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we did not had the work of work in London , which we now have .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &apos;ll pull down the ru@@ d@@ der completely . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday evening , B@@ am opened up the doors in the first half of the game with a set@@ back from the se@@ am .
India was not going into the game without victory in the tournament , but the team showed un@@ sur@@ ge and held the playing time from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter to B@@ am the game in their hands .
it carried out a Sprint with the flat ball about the left fl@@ ank , then moved into the middle and lu@@ p@@ ens the ball in the gate around the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 guidance .
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of all the tournament for the por@@ ridge of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who had to book the goal of each of the previous games in each of the previous games .
it has a run .
as well as B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will draw the result of the next game on Saturday .
in the middle of the Olympic Games , the Zen of Tramp@@ ol@@ ines
wherever you are too late , the Olympic Games are too late .
the events in Rio de Janeiro feel continuously and un@@ defiled , a sh@@ aving relay between competition and stre@@ ches .
it is known as the Olympic tor@@ ch itself would be a burning staff , who protect the rolls of the Turner for tri@@ athletes at the time of tri@@ athletes .
you cannot place the TV , a newspaper or listen to the talk about your neigh@@ bors in the qu@@ eu@@ e @-@ shop without hearing at Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ covers , or the battle between Michael Ph@@ el@@ ps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there are Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a female s@@ warm of dimples , could quite be submitted to Prime Time , constructed by sponsors and well @-@ being TV advertis@@ ements if he was a s@@ wimm@@ ers , Turner or even f@@ ond .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , Lake Forest , California , fighting for the olymp@@ ic tramp@@ ol@@ ines around gold .
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate any event .
further from the center , partly in the shade there are sports @-@ types that are not univers@@ ally recognized : air@@ pist@@ ol shooting , arch@@ ery , Bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ w@@ ondo .
we will always have the chest swimming and let it rule for long .
but if I have a modest arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , then let me go attention to the dis@@ crete charm of the tr@@ amp .
although the tramp@@ ol@@ in@@ ip had been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it had its debut there in Sydney , the past 16 years so much that I asked , did not know that at all , there is a Olympi@@ ad portal .
this could also be regional ignor@@ ance .
although the US athletes did to fight for competition , it has never won a medal in the tramp@@ ol@@ in@@ ip , and had an athl@@ ete until 2012 , who made it until the end of the final round .
the Chinese and the Rus@@ sians are decre@@ ed to divide the prizes for the men and the Chinese and the Canadi@@ ans for the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ Lenn@@ an from Canada will defend their Gold Medal from London this year .
the tramp@@ ol@@ in@@ ip has a certain exterior char@@ me , partly because it sounds for the un@@ explained ears for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ school for the Olympic Games .
I should ad@@ mit that I &apos;m not an expert , but I just am an experienced enthusiasts .
it has hum@@ or@@ ist@@ ical potential - Cart@@ o@@ on@@ ous cit@@ ations of his never s@@ wollen s@@ lit - but also the Gra@@ zie of gy@@ ms and dive , which combines two sports , which is essentially un@@ iting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trampoline &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El trampoline , which means as much as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spr@@ ung@@ board &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
up@@ stream sk@@ ip on a gig@@ antic trampoline , shoot nearly up to 30 feet into the air and have to land a number of falling movements ( thresh@@ ing , H@@ real and Sal@@ tos ) before falling down at the feet .
according to the official Olympic network , you &apos;ll be judged by the execution of difficulty and &quot; Flight . &quot;
two young athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will join in Rio each other .
the most common Olympic V@@ ektor is straight ahead .
med@@ alli@@ ons have to continue to gold in their way to gold , faster , back and over , sometimes up to the finish , sometimes up and back , down and down on the playground .
you will not only hunt the Zi@@ eg@@ in@@ ie or the starting wall , but also in the television broadcast : one of the world or the Olympic team .
the goal is Nobel , ad@@ mir@@ able , even fan@@ atic - and it &apos;s enough to stir even a spect@@ ator .
but it &apos;s also what I feel at watching this games as a little tired .
the trampoline offers an re@@ pri@@ eve .
the v@@ ector of the tramp@@ ol@@ ines is above .
a forward movement is not the target .
he or pr@@ un@@ cle , seem@@ ingly he@@ avi@@ est as a ast@@ ron@@ aut , goes down to the top , then effort@@ lessly back to the top .
there is also a contest , of course not without difficulty , but during exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the destination , no wol@@ ves into the distance , only the dre@@ aming , elegant re@@ vocation of time and gravity .
it is that Zen can only be Zen in the Olympic Games .
the qualifying and final round of women will be held on Friday afternoon , in the streaming around 13.00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13.00 .
N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the final round as part of a supplement block on both days from 14.00 .
in the middle of the Olympia @-@ Man@@ ie they talk to a quiet , nice moment , one who is likely to see in general tum@@ ult .
if the increase of consciousness can only be reached by the Ang@@ ers and the object of male athletes - how it proposed the male US Turner according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his ring to ring the new fan base .
&quot; a generation protest@@ ing &quot; in Ethiopia , Long an alliance of the USA
violent protests in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators , call for political changes in Ethiopia , shooting a violent opposition to the government .
witnesses say that they were killed protest@@ ers during con@@ dol@@ ences with police in Sch@@ uss@@ ars .
is Ethiopia just doing besides ?
in the past ten years , it was one of the most stable African countries , a solid alliance with a rapidly growing economy .
but in recent months , protests against the government had destroyed the land and far more areas .
last week , thousands of people caught on the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
the government &apos;s response was not merciful to human rights organizations .
witnesses testified that polic@@ emen were shot and killed un@@ armed and killed .
in circulation , videos on the protests , presumably taken from the last or beginning of this year , show how safe people strike young people with sticks , while they were forced to make a hand against a wall .
the Chief of the UN High Authority for Human Rights now demands a further investigation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was always difficult to keep this country and future will even be more difficult , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after Nigeria , Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country of Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West .
American military and intelligence services collabor@@ ates closely with Ethiopia , in order to fight terror over the region , particularly in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if ever , get a lot of Western help .
Ethiopia &apos;s economy grew in considerable pace .
his infrastructure has been dra@@ stically improved - there is a new piv@@ ot train in the capital Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
the streets are generally quiet , safe and clean .
although Ethiopia had all other than a model for democracy - human rights organizations have continued to improve repression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted , whereby dis@@ sidents were brought into silence .
many were sent into exile or sent into prison , or cast into the Desert times of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you supp@@ ress people and these no other options have to protest , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in Central Ethiop@@ ian . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the whole youth protest@@ ed .
a generation protest@@ ed .
there are numerous symptoms that cover everything from land use until the lit@@ igation of the rule on power of the rule .
following a broad@@ ly critical election last year , the reg@@ ent party and its allies received the final seat of the opposition and now control 100 per cent of the parliament .
at the same time , the st@@ resses rise along the border to Erit@@ rea ; a battle for these z@@ ack@@ ing , controversi@@ al line called for hundreds of life in June .
analy@@ st fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts such as the O@@ rom@@ o @-@ Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of O@@ g@@ aden , which have been en@@ forced more or less , the tur@@ bul@@ ence arose and could be armed again .
several factors explain why feelings of bit@@ ing after years of age are now explo@@ de under the surface .
the first seems to be harm@@ less : Smartphones .
only in recent years very much Ethiop@@ ians were able to communicate through the social media , as cheaper smartphones have been more common and improved the Internet services .
even if the government has access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do in regular intervals , especially with protests , so many people can still communicate via internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide themselves where they hold itself .
several young Ethiopia gave it to protest to protests .
the second factor is that it &apos;s more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ nic@@ ers in Ethiopia .
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are no natural enemies .
since Ethiopia pro@@ sper@@ sed the Am@@ har@@ as , who are predominantly Christian high countries , in politics and business , while the Oro@@ mos explo@@ ited , of which many Muslims are living and in flat land areas live .
but this is changing just too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in the way to coordinate with a screen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the largest protests were held in the areas of Am@@ har@@ a and Bar@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ chi have dominated the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray , who account for about 6 percent of the population , who are dominant in the military services , trade and politics .
the third reason for in@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Mel@@ es , a former rebellion until his death came to a non @-@ public illness in 2012 for 17 years of Ethiopia &apos;s Prime Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was considered a tac@@ tical Genius , a man that could think about corners .
anal@@ ysts say that it was especially licensed to use early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and to use special agreements to edit the opponent and to make them harm@@ less .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime is lack@@ ing in this basic skill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen out of relatively unknown reasons to take the position of Mr Mel@@ es .
unlike the Lord Mel@@ es , who came out of the tiger of the north of Ethiop@@ ian , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south .
anal@@ ysts say that it does not enjoy the confidence of the security services by the Tig@@ ray .
many fears that the result will be more bloo@@ d@@ shed .
the last time that Ethiopia had experienced such an u@@ pro@@ ar in 2005 , after thousands of the elections were protest@@ ed by the government , and then stolen from the government .
during the following ra@@ ids were killed many protest@@ ers , even if it were less than in the past months and that time of distur@@ ban@@ ces were relatively quickly past .
development rep@@ lied Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their visionary infrastructure plans , such as new P@@ end@@ ars , as well as for its meas@@ ur@@ able progress in poverty .
but apparently this did not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the anti @-@ Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
the last month , protest@@ ers in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ bo@@ lic city , by Tig@@ ray , shops and hat@@ red against the tig@@ ray is always exercis@@ able in the social media .
anal@@ ysts say that the protests had the USA and other Western allies in a separate position .
the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights on the neighboring Somalia , even if she recently announced that it closed this base .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the West , he clearly wants to support democracy , he will not say that his ban collap@@ sed in an already vol@@ at@@ ile area . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin thing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump declares his claim to IS@@ IS that &quot; Sar@@ ac@@ mus &quot; was founded .
Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to scatter the last contro@@ vers@@ y , the last contro@@ vers@@ y , trying to overthrow his campaign , President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton , the &quot; founder &quot; of the Islam@@ ischer state , would not be serious .
this clari@@ fication designed new questions to the communication capabilities of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans whether he is able to communicate clearly and communicate with the American public .
it also brings his Mit@@ stre@@ ites who try to take him during an event@@ ful phase in which the actual position that he could have not meant .
after having made the unveil@@ ing of a campaign event on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump had dismissed in relation to the asser@@ tion on Thursday and continu@@ ance in interviews that he was really not intended to recogn@@ ise the President and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS .
but in an early morning , Mr. Tr@@ ump , Mr. Tr@@ ump , he was simply sar@@ cast@@ ically .
contrary to the previous day , Mr. Tr@@ ump was in a number of interviews on which Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a number of interviews that said the debt .
when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ o@@ der@@ ator Hug@@ h He@@ wit@@ t said Mr. Tr@@ ump , wanted to do the testimony of anything , trying to destroy him , that Mr. Obama wants to destroy it from the republi@@ can presidential candidate .
the last storm of criticism against Mr. Tr@@ ump descended , while he tries to guide the focus of his campaign due to decline in economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton held Spe@@ eches on the Michigan of Michigan , this week .
on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump was trying to return to this topic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Twitter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he warned that Mrs. Clin@@ tons would lead to higher taxes and that he had bor@@ ing their talk bor@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump has brought Sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense already .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of July , he moved to criticism when he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Rus@@ sians should have h@@ iss emails , but he later said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Of course I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Natur@@ ally &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this method does not allow Mr. Tr@@ ump to move the lingu@@ istic limits in politics and then return to ru@@ sters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages received from his fans , as they arrive , and then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert , who observed the language of both candidates &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it is clever enough to keep his statements , so that they can be interpreted in different manner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
instead , instead of the tone for the presidential election , Mr. Tr@@ ump has accepted an un@@ riv@@ alled whose tone , since its surveys have been further declined .
a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , who was released on Friday , showed a lead in the Federal States of North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado , and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump in general is trying to exc@@ use himself for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he accused his critics , cla@@ iming his statements or in@@ corrup@@ ted his hum@@ or .
but while he has strengthened the attention of attention during the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ umps Scher@@ ze his lo@@ y@@ als participation in the un@@ comfortable situation to stand to him , regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ant may be his statements .
Rud@@ olph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ umps &apos;s celeb@@ r@@ ities , gave himself great effort to defend the candidates in a CNN interview from Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe what he says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Giuli@@ ani , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Giuli@@ ani said to the correc@@ t@@ ness of Mr. Tr@@ umps in question whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had formed the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true in this sense that Obama was almost unknown , small organization , he called her back@@ bit@@ es , completely false and so that it happened to hit the troops from Iraq .
most of the ma@@ inst@@ re@@ am Repub@@ lic@@ ans are attemp@@ ting to discuss that the government served under Obama as Secretary of State , IS@@ IS allowed to spread it by the situation in the Middle East .
before the election campaign in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media , and threw his attacks on the media , on each of his words and to be connected with him before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he de@@ fied the &quot; poor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; television experts who try to understand him , saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It cannot be ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the Democrats sp@@ y over Mr. Tr@@ umps to ap@@ ologies than just a further proof that it is un@@ suitable for the presidential office .
once more about the price of the market , Café in Green@@ point is coming back
using the verb Cafe was a fo@@ aming café in William@@ sburg , where one could pay only bar that had no Wi @-@ Fi for 15 years but good coffee .
of course , the prices from its Bed@@ ford Avenue Lad@@ en@@ front was ou@@ sted .
the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , which sat in the summer of 2014 , sells soap in the form of Cup@@ cakes .
the loc@@ als ensu@@ ed there as last loss in a gent@@ leman &apos;s town .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ ab wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is changing , but I still cannot believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea hotel is exemp@@ ted and has now been a soap business . &quot;
but when New York change is , then it is also new .
a restored ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new Ver@@ b has Wi @-@ Fi and accepted Credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similar atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the Ver@@ b is Cisco Rodri@@ guez , a long @-@ standing employee of the old caf@@ és , the owner and managing director of the new caf@@ és .
he began working at Ver@@ b in 2001 , and remained there until the end .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when a customer offered to provide money for a new branch , he was excited to do it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rodri@@ guez , 36 , has many things .
using the verb , the same distributor for the Bag@@ els bought the same es@@ pres@@ som@@ ic machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ guez said that he would also have experim@@ enting .
he led new ingredients .
on the menu offers sand@@ wi@@ ches with bac@@ on and cheese and there are gar@@ ni@@ es such as cap@@ ers and s@@ aut@@ é onions .
there is natural gas station .
the café offers no beer more , there are fresh ju@@ ices .
after nine months Rodri@@ guez said that he had noticed an old current of old people .
&quot; many old customers were also pushed through prizes from William@@ sburg , &quot; he said .
recently , Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was a good customer recently .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in William@@ sburg , and then visiting the Ver@@ b regularly .
even after they had gone to Green@@ point , she would take the way straight .
after that Ver@@ b had closed , she gave a while the coff@@ in ink , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was clear that it was on the coffee and at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Culture &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she told me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she drinks of coffee , even if she served on that day instead of the usual I@@ ced coffee , which is ordered a bl@@ ended C@@ hai Tea , who is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a long@@ time and faithful customer since the start of the Ver@@ b in 2003 .
he went there before the work , and he ordered in@@ sof@@ ar as the same .
&quot; I came forth to seven , every day as a Swiss watch watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; he said .
photo Rodri@@ guez said he wanted to experiment and record new ingredients in the menu .
nowadays Ros@@ enthal gets his usual order but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing @-@ Ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ guez said that he has no gro@@ ll , that the soap &apos;s business has taken the old business area .
actually , the owners of So@@ ap Ch@@ erie to produce a special soap for ver@@ b with the cold bre@@ w@@ ed coffee of caf@@ és .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we will go out on their offer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rodri@@ guez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional , Polish people Green@@ points have also accepted the café .
a new customer has translated the menu in Polish and Rodri@@ guez , and Rodri@@ guez said that he would see them soon , so that his new neigh@@ bors feel .
the site also has further advantages .
a local juice wants to fill the cold bre@@ w@@ ed coffee to bottles .
there is a chance that the café expands on an adjacent building .
for many customers , a new dec@@ b is enough to get their old favorites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a captain and said that he was destroyed in the ground when the café closed .
when the new café opened , Wh@@ ites said it felt that the loc@@ als and the best coffee is felt like a hom@@ ec@@ oming .
&quot; I had to smell the smell , &quot; he said .
the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; a rich meal &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his ascent to the President , Franklin Del@@ ano Roosevelt gave his lunch at the O@@ val Office .
as g@@ our@@ mets , President Roosevelt a F@@ ai@@ ble for refined delic@@ acy on Fifth Avenue such as P@@ â@@ te de Fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland - other tur@@ tle soup .
his menu on that day was a bit more modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , potato p@@ ure@@ e , and des@@ serts a pl@@ ums p@@ ud@@ ding .
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with the younger people , &quot; said Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man .
her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans that should eat . &quot;
a couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food histor@@ ian .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ es last book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; CH@@ OP Su@@ ey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was told from Chinese cuisine in the USA while bricks in a residential building on the Lower East Side of the food perspective &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
her latest collaboration , &quot; A permanent meal , &quot; which will be published on Tuesday in Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity , when they meet with a repor@@ ter at the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small , schn@@ au@@ ell@@ os@@ em I@@ mb@@ h in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock market crash of 1929 .
Zi@@ egel@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh water wich with olive gro@@ oves , while Co@@ e , 57 , Tru@@ th@@ ahn with potato p@@ ure@@ e and vegetables ate .
when the repor@@ ter placed h@@ ack@@ ing , this was found the pair for discussion about the food in the era of Great Depression .
&quot; rich food were very popular , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man .
there were pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread .
they were made out of an ad@@ ress and somewhat cheaper that sho@@ cks the allocation .
imagine , so many pe@@ an@@ uts have to eat they serve them as dinner .
CO@@ E grin@@ d .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must be in the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before the Great Depression , the table was in a American household , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ you @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
teams of women bo@@ iled for male field@@ work and it was served in fresh past@@ ries for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was the Americans that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was sent to Europeans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; character@@ ises the roads with which the land went with it , no longer to be the way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time in the food for the Americans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
similarly , the new bud@@ get@@ ic food : mysterious foods such as bread and c@@ asser@@ ole were rep@@ elled to primary food , c@@ asser@@ ole as a wonderful kind to rep@@ ut@@ ili@@ ze , while coo@@ ks could hide the appet@@ ite ingredients under an ench@@ anting sauce .
fresh fruit has been replaced by cheap dry .
meat , the year of the American kitchen , became very rare in a very rare luxury .
in@@ trin@@ sic mixtures were tested , as a low cal@@ ori@@ ous and nutr@@ itious satisfaction before flavor or even healthy kitchen had .
during their search for the book , which also consists of a dish from this ep@@ och , ch@@ ack@@ ened onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter .
&quot; there was no popular addition at lunch , &quot; says Co@@ e .
Zi@@ egel@@ mann goes further from : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and fried onions fit not to each other .
it was typical for many of the house@@ keeping recipes .
as never before or since then , the household of household income - including Louise Stanley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 @-@ 1943 - the eating hab@@ its of the country .
by buying the recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to be able to trans@@ form P@@ amp@@ e such as cre@@ amy sp@@ aghetti with carr@@ ots in delicious meals .

while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa farm kitchen with its kitchen , sp@@ ei@@ ste it is as the one @-@ million@@ th man of the world to whom he has become .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he liked the continental cuisine as fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ate in a silver plated dining room and contributed a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was del@@ ight@@ ful real@@ ess .
President Roosevelt might have committed the same mist@@ akes , if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or would have asked him to equ@@ ip him with his stomach .
as described in the book , the An@@ ties of a house@@ keeper with no interest in flav@@ ours by Ms. Roosevelt , that the White House brought the bor@@ ing food in Washington , but also one of the most difficult eating . &quot;
many of the types of the era of Great Depression , with food would be rejected , once the country returned to the legs .
the Legacy is on our ongoing focus on calories and nour@@ ishment , she said Zi@@ egel@@ man , and there@@ on how science was applied to food .
the pair gave to the writing of the book to understand the eating hab@@ its of Zi@@ egel@@ mans @-@ in @-@ in @-@ law - for example how food could not throw away food .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had a real fear of waste , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zi@@ egel@@ man remembered : &quot; they actually did sick . &quot;
there was the wind@@ fall of wind@@ fall .
after the plates were cleared by Eis@@ enbe@@ ek &apos;s , they pulled down and Co@@ e a dessert , which she had prepared at home : the p@@ tu@@ re@@ ed , ate the President Roosevelt to noon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man and added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it was a usual tri@@ ck to miss out a little name . &quot; &quot; &quot;

he was the hero of Ale@@ pp@@ o : Khal@@ ed Omar , his life in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ris@@ ky everything to save the life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old died on a burning bomb attack on the Assad regime .
Omar was a member of the White Hel@@ mets , &quot; a civil protection , which has been saved by nearly 60,000 people in accordance with the newspaper @-@ Zeitung .
29@@ 00 Vol@@ unte@@ ers have their own life on the game to move people from bom@@ bed houses and aff@@ ord their first aid in the war .
they are the her@@ oes of the war in Syria .
Omar was the vision of the group : a video of the Civil Defence , which shows him with an 11 @-@ hour rescue of a house from the deser@@ ts of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syrians to the luminous figure in the grave of the war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as her@@ oes , he never seen himself , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me is the true Ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I die , live life , I think that God sees a mart@@ yr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before Omar himself had an attack for a victim , he had spoken in a video about the last bombing attacks in Syria .
the hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter have been subjected to four facade bombs via the Alz@@ ette district , one was filled with chlorine gas .
one woman and two children died , seven people suffer from bre@@ aths .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &apos;ll be able to remove the remains of the bomb , so that they will not play children , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cited the image his last words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime should come to terror@@ ists .
Greenland : the oldest te@@ br@@ oth is nearly 400 years old
more rare sight .
Greenland ha@@ ie usually occur in the winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea on board the research ship S@@ anna .
it was born in 16@@ 24 and floating with a top speed of 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Greenland ha@@ ves got up to 150 years of offspring .
in an hour , on average , in an hour , on average it reaches 1,@@ 220 metres in the Greenland &apos;s North Atlantic .
only if it goes on , the five @-@ metre long animal accelerates to a wh@@ opping 2.6 km / h - and this top speed is half as fast as a Rob@@ be .
this of long@@ itude shaped lifestyle seems to be a sponsor@@ ship for a high age .
Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues have reported in the journal Science &quot; in any case from Greenland , who could be 392 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mad@@ ness , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; commented Alexander Sch@@ ed@@ lein from the Max Planck Institute for demo@@ graphic Research in Rostock , which means a world record for ver@@ te@@ br@@ ates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
indeed , the ev@@ olu@@ tionary biolog@@ ist assumed a long time in Greenland .
just missing the evidence .
Greenland ha@@ ie are difficult to observe , finally they live mainly in the ice sea before the thin@@ ly popul@@ ated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard .
because they prefer to water temperatures around 6 degrees Celsius , they appear mostly in the winter only in winter .
to know about the lifestyle of Greenland , researchers have little .
their tim@@ es@@ pent@@ ag@@ rams they were , as they presented six animals with a broad@@ caster .
spoil this shar@@ k : in the stomach of a beast , researchers found the remains of a Rob@@ be , another had swal@@ lowed the pine bones of a young ic@@ b@@ ären .
may you may ch@@ ase them sleeping animals or pat@@ rol on the reason of the ice sea and are Kad@@ aver , who tor@@ ates from higher levels of water according to bottom .
Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues were now survey@@ ed 28 Greenland , the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Sp@@ it@@ s@@ bergen from the depth of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cm long while the biggest 502 centi@@ metres dimension .
to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed the core of the shar@@ ks with its carbon @-@ 14 method .
this centre of the eye lens is already born before the birth of the shar@@ ks , which contained therein will no longer be renewed .
the two smallest shar@@ ks had a lot of carbon @-@ 14 in the lens core .
their birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s , as a nuclear test @-@ try major amounts of this radio@@ active carbon into the atmosphere .
in the length of 220 centimeters in length , the l@@ ender &apos;s length on carbon @-@ 14 , however , contained a low surplus of carbon @-@ 14 in its nuclear weapon , so it is likely to celebrate its 50th birthday in 2012 .
all bigger Greenland ha@@ em@@ y had its carbon @-@ 14 quantities in its lens , which occurs by cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 is demonstrated for a 4@@ 93 centimeters long Greenland @-@ shar@@ k , at the age of 335 , while the record shar@@ k could be 392 years old .
the Greenland @-@ females just got up again , when they are longer than four metres , was known .
now , the researchers of the length were assigned to age .
since one of the animals with 392 centimeters will probably be on the threshold of the sexually mature and its age with 156 years has been determined , Greenland &apos;s shar@@ k resi@@ due to at least one and a half centuries .
that is likely to be the world record for ver@@ te@@ br@@ ates .
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ ise live mainly in icy waters , is no co@@ incidence .
also the old record holder , a 211 years old Greenland , whose sp@@ ouse was on neck a 120 @-@ year old harp pointed , was caught before Alaska .
due to its low temperatures , the organis@@ m of the living @-@ living creatures frequently runs on Spar@@ fl@@ ames .
so you realize later - and al@@ der slow@@ est .
in order to keep warm in cold water , the animals are often extremely large .
for the volume grows much faster than its surface , due to the animal heat .
the heat loss of a gram of mouse is therefore much larger than with a gram of eleph@@ ant .
another advantage : you have less enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a smaller animal is so dangerous and should focus on it as early as possible as many generations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains the ev@@ olu@@ tionary approach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a very big animal should rather invest his resources in a long life .
building ground in double pack
the Municipal Council agre@@ es with topics around building in the recent meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with relief , the panel adopted the communication of Mayor Robert P@@ utz said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally the marketing of the recently stated residence area can begin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
according to the City of Paris , the City of Paris is the best chances of putting jobs and companies in London in the competition with Paris , Dublin , Ireland .
&quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt am most advant@@ aged by Bre@@ x@@ it vote , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , Head of Excellence in Financial Markets and Real Estate Markets of I@@ W .
after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum it is un@@ certain to continue to operate in London from financial transactions within the whole EU .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the so @-@ called EU @-@ Pass you have to date approval in Britain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is just major US banks .
several banks have already announced that jobs will be stored .
the &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; lob@@ b@@ ying &quot; will be added to 10000 new jobs in the Main for five years .
for Frankfurt , so the I@@ W , the headquarters of the European Central Bank ( EC@@ B ) , the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks of the euro zone , and further important authorities like the European insurance view E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk assessment ES@@ R@@ B .
in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) have its headquarters , but this would be less significant for the financial sector less than the EC@@ B .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; close to the music bank is important for banks , as they can communicate directly with the supervision program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luxemburg has become a great fund sector , and cut down equally like Dublin in the infrastructure .
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the great airport .
further points the city with easily available commercial real estate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris it is not so easy to find free of high @-@ quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the Seine , the rentals of business real estate can be 50 percent higher than the Main Event .
in addition , Frankfurt announced a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime .
in a ranking of the consulting firm Mer@@ cer increased the city at No. 19 , Luxemburg on No.@@ 19 , Dublin at No. 33 and Paris on 3@@ 7th place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even if the quality of life is a question of pre@@ ferences : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its already strong position as a financial location for the European internal market , Frankfurt could put further banks and investors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fol@@ ds the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , in spite of Bre@@ x@@ it , the most important financial centre in Europe will remain in Europe , my econom@@ ists .
for this , the forces measures : in London , according to the figures of Landesbank Hel@@ aba around the end of 2015 about 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking sector , in Frankfurt there were 6@@ 2500 .

Hill@@ ary Clinton released their tax declaration on Friday in 2015 , with a revenue of USD 10,@@ 75 million for the presidential election of Democrats and her husband and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % .
in 2015 , the Clinton Foundation donated USD 1 million for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton &apos;s former Foreign Minister , posted a income of USD 3 million from Simon &amp; Sch@@ uster for their book on their office in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs .

in a stark contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump hidden behind false thinking and re@@ trac@@ ers in relation to his existing promises .
it is common to publish its fiscal statements for US presidential data , although they are not obliged by law because of the law .
Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers are given as a reason for its ref@@ usal to control the tax authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the train , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Clin@@ tons election campaign in Ian SAM@@ S on Twitter , in relation to the publication of the presidential data in Democrats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday Michael Coh@@ en , Tr@@ umps special advisor to CNN , that it would not be allowed to publish somewhat before the tax checks are not completed .

Clinton has already over@@ thrown on the theme and to be released on Friday a video on the internet , in which the high @-@ level Repub@@ lic@@ ans Tr@@ ump to publish his fiscal policy .
on Thursday she said the subject during a speech to the economy in Michigan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ref@@ uses to do what every other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and his tax declared , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the amount . &quot; &quot; &quot;
POL@@ IC@@ ICO reported that Tr@@ ump has paid no less tax during the 1990s , and a business journalist of the New York Times was quoted on Friday a number of tax ev@@ asion and tax advis@@ ers that could always be the case .
you have become a topic in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a regulation which is named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren buff@@ ets that people would pay more than USD 1 million a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during a voting event for Hill@@ ary Clinton in Omaha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called on Buff@@ ets , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate stands here , Tr@@ ump to exchange their tax advoc@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Buff@@ ets said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he had been subjected to a tax review of I@@ RS and Tr@@ ump &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was afraid of voters and not before tax authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clin@@ tons campaign has back tax return back to 2007 .
the Clinton , which is now living in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , paid for an effective Federal tax rate of approx . 32 % between 2007 and 2014 , and an effective tax rate of approx . 4@@ 0,5 % .
the tax Declaration of the Clin@@ tons of 2015 showed that this only $ 100 of their income was involved as a salary , unlike the majority of all Americans .
the major investment fund was a cost @-@ effective index fund , from which the clinical tons divi@@ den@@ ds and yields of USD 10@@ 9,000 .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Jewish director sm@@ ashes Berliner Hotel because Israeli pre@@ fix was removed after &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Arab &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - RT News &quot; &quot; &quot;
a French director with Jewish roots un@@ sealed a media stand , after he had betrayed the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin since the Kemp@@ inski Hotel in Berlin had requested an employee as a staff . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust &quot; Shoah , &quot; left his anger at the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by replacing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel in the country @-@ country list of the hotel .
however , the country was not listed among the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room .
how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , possible that Israel was eliminated and deleted ?
wrote l@@ ance .
instead the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Bristol offers an opportunity to choose Israel via an own call centre .
after a statement , the director turned to the hotel .
the answer which he received there was &quot; sho@@ cking him , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel noted that the measure has been a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of the management of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason that stood behind , dissolved in the director , was even more fur@@ ious .
&quot; the majority of our guests are Arab and they have demanded that the pre @-@ election is deleted , &quot; the employees of Lanz@@ mann is cited .
Israeli ambassador to Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man named this a &quot; big dis@@ grace , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung .
we were astonished and dis@@ ma@@ yed out of this event .
that is really very disappointed .
the fact that this has happened in Germany in precisely this hotel chain is even a bigger dis@@ grace .
no explanation requires that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ministers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident dissolved a rather big reson@@ ance in the internet , where people exposed to a sc@@ andal .
some instru@@ cts the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it had &quot; been added to the alleged collection of Arab guests . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said in a different contribution , in which it was pointed out that the hotel is located at the no@@ c@@ ous Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm in the vicinity of a synagogue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel quickly declared all the alleg@@ ations of himself and called the incident a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; see &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fault &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Lanz@@ mann , Der Spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a direct statement , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Israel does not want to record the Quick@@ ly list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the German newspaper entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spokes@@ man for the Kemp@@ inski Hotel &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

trading between Russia and Iran rise suddenly on 71 % - RT Business
the sanctions imposed by the sanctions imposed by Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the trade exchange between Moscow and Teheran , grew by 7@@ 0.9 percent .
since the International sanctions against Iran have lifted its interest on pages of Russian companies to shops in the country , distributed as ambassador to the Russian Federation .
Russian companies take up existing connections with Iran , while new companies are ready to provide access to the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the further trade expansion is one of the greatest priorities of the bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he noted that the trading volume was between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2016 by 7@@ 0.9 percent , compared to the same period in 2015 , and $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , Russian imports increased 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the trade show was achieved by deliveries of machinery , land @-@ vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ambassador . &quot; &quot; &quot;
D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan goes for this year from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
last year the Russian Foreign Invest@@ ors represented around 35,000 Vis@@ as , primarily by Reis@@ ev@@ is@@ as , on Iranian citizens .
in addition , Iran reached the top 20 countries , regarding the tourist tax in Russia .
one could say that the record numbers of Irish tourists will be broken in Russia from last year , &quot; he said .
at the same time , only relatively few Rus@@ sians can visit Iran , some of whom the ambassador is hopes to change that it will change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I personally can recommend the visit of the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d , who received the monuments of old Persian civ@@ ilization in a good condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Sh@@ otto Call@@ um Sk@@ inner tur@@ neth home when Br@@ ite Gold for cycling over@@ scores
Scotland Call@@ um Sk@@ inner &apos;s last night in the Män@@ ner@@ flow Sprint at the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio to glory as the British team def@@ ended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the anchor , who had made his fellow coun@@ try@@ man Sir Chris Ho@@ y to E@@ igen . he made the legend proud when he stor@@ my home , to secret a victory of the Favor@@ ites New Zealand .
four years ago England claimed a sho@@ cking win , while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympi@@ ag@@ ol@@ d@@ med@@ ail@@ len .
they repeated the tri@@ ck after they take place in March at the World Championships in London despite the withdrawal of Ho@@ ys just a modest sixth place .
the problem between Beijing and London was the substitute for Jamie Staff .
they did so in time as an execution .
Ho@@ ys retirement creates a gap that tried K@@ ian Em@@ adi and Matt Cr@@ ampton .
Sk@@ inner was the man when they stayed , when they saw the potential in the vill@@ i which now un@@ folded .
hin@@ der , Kenn@@ y - who won four years ago with Ho@@ y winner - and Sk@@ inner were competing for a Olympic team , but in the standard round the New Zealand mar@@ gins on the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
after his round was barely back , but Kenn@@ y brought the team to the front and Sk@@ inner .
a strategic change made a major part of transformation from the execution of a higher gear to slow it to slow and Kenn@@ y and especially Sk@@ inner to keep the pace .
Ho@@ y saw a BBC expert from his position as a BBC expert , and fell Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ ts when they went on the podium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make it a name .
we have set up a Olympi@@ ad record and over@@ thrown the world champion .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win .
after the end of 2012 on the side of Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys , he gave the way that it fell on track after a weak start .
he with@@ drew this statement later and there was no appeal of English rival .
with such a superior win this time there was no such problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It feels like the whole GB flags on the grand@@ stand as London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we joined the team in the last three months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are so bad with so many world tit@@ els , so that it was incredible to win back at the Olympi@@ ad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation that were obtained seven of 10 titles both in Beijing and London .
if this is the progress of our progress in the last five months , we expect our successful five days at Vel@@ o@@ drome .
with the form Kenn@@ y , it is possible in the field of possible that he repeated Ho@@ ys victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition .
this would be younger than Ho@@ y , who was born exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on March 23 . Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ es were born - a yield of six gold medals and silver medal .
they should be equal to the Ho@@ y of Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y is taking part in the Sprint , which starts today and will go over three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always best .
it can win it with his colleagues .
it feels something to win alone , alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; When he wins two other gold medals , he should be beaten up to the kn@@ ight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only med@@ alli@@ sts of the day , but there was further good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ cel@@ W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed Cl@@ ancy , Steven Bur@@ ke and Ov@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ four kilometres race .
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 .
the World Record , which won gold in London in 2012 was 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 659 .
on the second day of competition , the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will be held on the second day of the competition , on the W@@ ig@@ gins with safety .
he met yesterday with evidence of the qualification before the qualification , when officials called him to measure his height .
in the corresponding Women &apos;s Competition , which continues to be continued and terminated , av@@ anc@@ er Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Bar@@ ker and K@@ atie Archi@@ soon of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ av@@ ie in world record time in 4 : 13.@@ 260 .
the GB Team will leave his strong railway team to domin@@ ate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a ch@@ ar to medals .
after a truly remarkable feature of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio were driven down .
in April , Dr@@ amas played in the background , as the re@@ sign@@ ation of the technical lad@@ der Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April in the midst of Sex@@ ual and Mo@@ b@@ b@@ ing@@ es and reti@@ ring of sizes like Ho@@ y and Victoria P@@ end@@ leton .

the future of aluminium shells from Portland , Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs of workers - stand on the game , since the plant operators are announced the energy supply contract and that all delivery contracts shall be provided , as the supplying energy companies distributed .
this step followed by the Government &apos;s decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsi@@ dies to operate the plant .
a sub@@ sid@@ y for 20 years is in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the system of AL@@ CO@@ A in Portland is available on the game .
not less than 2000 work@@ stations -@@ direct and indirect - could be at risk .
in addition , it could get to domin@@ ate effects , since the sm@@ el@@ os consumes about 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Vic@@ tor@@ ias .
in 2014 , AL@@ CO@@ A completed the Point Henry melt , which led to a closing of the Angl@@ es@@ ian power plant .
the melt of AL@@ CO@@ A in Portland loses money and ris@@ ked up a closure .
this step follows the lasting spec@@ ulations regarding the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the current price for the plant .
AG@@ L , which supplies the big aluminum hub with his Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , distributed that three further owners will announce their contracts .
the system is located in the majority of a joint venture of AL@@ CO@@ A and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p will hold smaller shares .
&quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Portland , what a further physical demand for electricity by the melting means &quot; divided the company .
AG@@ L also said that the contracts called &quot; securing transactions &quot; will be that starting in November 2016 .
the contracts have a 12 month notice period , so that they will end 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore AG@@ L assumes that the contracts will contribute to the income in the financial year 17 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the supply supplier said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impacts on income on AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong support markets for wholesale electricity prices .
AG@@ L announced that it has already written the value of the tre@@ aties at its annual statement of $ 187 million in &quot; anticip@@ ation of a cancellation . &quot;
AL@@ CO@@ A said that the decision to break the tre@@ aties , the &quot; ability Al@@ co@@ as ... to operate the melting , or the power to melt the melt . &quot;
the US company said that 2010 have completed a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , which should have been in force from November this year , even if it is still a statement , why it has withdrawn from the contract .
due to the poor economic conditions in the industry prior to the possible closing of the Portland founder , Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near Newcastle .
in reference to the statements of the anal@@ ysts at the beginning of the week , Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen , employs around 600 meg@@ awatt some 900 mega@@ watts every year .
if both plants disappear from the market , this would mean significant reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and for us as a generator , this would not be good &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than just a touch of reality TV @-@ Star , Kendall is on the cover of the September edition of the V@@ ogue
Antonio Jen@@ ner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the Man@@ ag@@ é@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner Cl@@ ans Kr@@ is is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September edition of the US V@@ ogue .
Kendall , the ambassador for E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der is and moved to fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on her inst@@ agra@@ m account .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a room full of people who I love , brought me the sight of this Co@@ vers to the wines , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kendall . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the unveil@@ ing of the Co@@ vers followed a bizar@@ re ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ a@@ els and producer of Ke@@ eping Up Ryan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) , as they end the cover of their sister and with a classical ling@@ ering : they are all planned for a sur@@ prises art@@ y .
this puts the sound @-@ cre@@ dible manus@@ crip@@ ts virtually every birthday party ( Se@@ ac@@ ea brought the proposition , &quot; You have had forgotten you ? , &quot; with the honour of a cartoon by 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kr@@ is had to be able to participate in this Pub@@ licity .
with regard to the September edition of the V@@ ogue , a new era of the Kar@@ das@@ her@@ ans started .
Kend@@ alls great sister Kim mag to see what the V@@ ogue cover goes to see ( she and her husband Kan@@ ye West were on it in April 2014 ) , but the magazine of the September issue is a league for themselves .
the September edition is the most popular edition of the year for V@@ ogue .
with a circum@@ ference , which resem@@ bles a picture tape as a fashion magazine resem@@ bles the issue a large number of ship@@ yards ( according to Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista were of the 8@@ 32 pages of the Bear@@ maker 615 pp ) .
the unveil@@ ing of its Co@@ ver@@ stars is expected to see that in the last two years , pictures of the magazine still existed before the official announcement .
women who were already in the cover include Na@@ omi Campbell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Moss .
in recent years , there were clearly more &quot; celeb@@ r@@ ities , the modeling &quot; as &quot; models that are celeb@@ r@@ ities &quot; on the cover .
in 2013 , Oscar @-@ Pre@@ ist@@ tra@@ gic and Di@@ or Brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence has been in 2013 on the cover , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor .
but even at low probability that Mrs. Jen@@ ner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; per@@ me@@ ated model &quot; of its generation - below the previous category is located in good company .
these celeb@@ r@@ ities are not related to famous people , or reality Stars or teen@@ ager from today , who know how to make a good Snap@@ chat video ( even if everything is upon Jen@@ ner ) .
they are truly talented women who are in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once appeared in the last cover , with the publication of Lem@@ on@@ ade one of the most successful years of their career .
of course J@@ enn@@ ers don &apos;t recommend it to everyone .
J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s role of reality in the fashion world has always been sc@@ anned .
in June , the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ Model Steph@@ anie Se@@ ym@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleagues in Gig@@ i H@@ adi@@ d and called them &quot; the mist@@ akes of the ey@@ eb@@ rows . &quot;
these feelings returned high , when the message came out with the publication J@@ enn@@ ers on the V@@ ogue cover .
but on the mis@@ carriage seems to be pointed out at the point .
Kendall Jen@@ ner is on the cover of the September edition of the V@@ ogue .
it is in the tru@@ est sense of the Word a super@@ model .
she goes for Marc Jacobs .
it makes advertising for your base coating from E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der .
you and all of their sisters sell your pictures from yourself to their respective Pay@@ wall apps .
they sold out from Cin@@ dy Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds daughter to the LO@@ VE journal .
and in her free time she is happening in reality TV . probably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .
public centers with 16@@ 0,000 people each year
more than 16@@ 0,000 of the aid of the country must be rejected by the community centers , while the industry reli@@ es on the impact of further Middle circuits on the impact .
in Que@@ ens@@ land three of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ real delic@@ acy and similar workers , who have been looking for free legal consultancy and legal dispute .
legal services of the municipality , which are already familiar , are prepared for further cuts .
as of June next year , a further 30 percent of them will lose their federal centers .
the director of the Municipal Cent@@ res of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell said that the last survey of the National Association of Community Cent@@ res revealed that thousands of people had to be rejected by people each year .
Far@@ rell said that the situation without a repe@@ al of the Federal Government would only be worse .
&quot; Que@@ ens@@ land Community centers are chron@@ ically sub@@ financed , which means thousands of people of important services that you need to be rejected , &quot; he said .
people who left violent relations , people with unbe@@ ar@@ able and inv@@ iting debts , families who have been dismissed by separ@@ ations , workers who do not have problems of just@@ ly and this collection , that they cannot receive the help you need .
by June 2017 , the federal government will cut by 30 percent as of June 2017 , which means thousands of helpful people from Que@@ ens@@ land to be forced to get their legal problems without any help .
we call for the General Federal Prosecutor and the Federal Ministry of Federal Minister as well as Sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ di , to keep up these Middle distances , so that people may need to preserve their assistance with legal problems .
last year the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal assistance on the national average .
it is now at that time the needs of the community centers and their client communities , as well as the Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k government has invested in this important work .

Berlin / Schwerin : survey from countries of the SPD : SPD and CD@@ U lose
in the upcoming elections in the Federal States of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) , substantial losses for government parties SPD and CD@@ U are character@@ ised .
the representative surveys of opinion research institutes IN@@ SA for the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
while the red @-@ black government coalition could continue to rain in the north , it is not possible after the surveys in Berlin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in both federal states the SPD would have the strongest party and would have good chances to set up the head of government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD pl@@ ung@@ ed by 3@@ 5.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent .
the party was only slightly ahead of the CD@@ U , which might come to 23 per cent again .
the third place is fought between the left and the Af@@ D .
the Lin@@ ke cheese has 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented for the first time in the country at 19 percent .
in spite of slight losses , despite slight losses , with 6 percent ( previously 8.7 percent ) again in the country &apos;s country .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP are not represented by 3 percent each in the country .
according to the Berlin Chamber of Dep@@ uties , the SPD dep@@ uties showed only 23 percent ( 2011 election : 28.@@ 3 percent ) .
the CD@@ U reached only 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
this is still behind the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but before the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the Af@@ D would be represented for the first time in the Chamber of Dep@@ uties with 14 percent .
with 5 percent , F@@ DP could hope to return , the pir@@ ates would miss it contrary to 2011 in contrast to 2011 .
Nokia 9000 communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
E @-@ Mail and Internet in Time : 20 years ago the Nokia Commun@@ ic@@ ator arrived on the market .
the successor today domin@@ ate the world - its producer experienced a disaster .
the device weighed almost half a half and was more than four times as hard as an iPhone 5 .
it was th@@ icker and larger , it was therefore not good in your hand .
on the contrary , it was rather kno@@ cked .
the built @-@ in memory was at the beginning eight Meg@@ abytes , which would suff@@ ice today for roughly two sel@@ ector with high resolution .
an iPhone is now supplied with at least 16 gig@@ abytes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nokia 9000 Commun@@ ic@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; arrived exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , and it was the first smartphone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a few euros , fans can still buy the devices in the internet , but they som@@ eh@@ ow come from the stone time of the Internet .
20 years ago , the Commun@@ ic@@ ator was a sens@@ ation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier on the computer Fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hanover as &quot; office in the western bottle format . &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone was able to send a lot : SMS and e @-@ mails were sent and received , also by fax was the Commun@@ ic@@ ator .
even the access to websites was possible via HTML @-@ browsers , even if qu@@ itting slowly .
a calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone couldn &apos;t be folded as a laptop .
then a small keyboard and a black @-@ white screen took place .
quite proud was the price : 2700 D @-@ Mark , which is about 1400 Euro .
the average selling price of smartphones in Germany was Euro 392 .
no one could have been in August 1996 that the Commun@@ ic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
the clu@@ ders phones are a success story if also not for Nokia .
the mobile phone card of the Finn@@ s experienced an exceptional disaster , was eventually sold to Microsoft .
today , the market will prevail , all of which many were later than Nokia .
ever and everywhere online , this is today for very many people daily .
in 2015 there were nearly two billion smartphone users around the world .
sold , around 1.4 billion devices have been sold on Samsung and Apple , this amounts to 555 million units alone .
worldwide sales with the equipment is around 400 billion euros .
to this end , the well @-@ running business of the countless app providers and the telecommunications concert will come .
around the smartphone , around the smartphone is now developed .
the decisive breakthrough came to the mass market in early 2007 , at that time , Apple CEO Steve Jobs on the Mac @-@ World announced the introduction of the i@@ Ph@@ ones .
he promised three units in one : one music player , a telephone and an internet communications , all via touch screen easy to operate .
the winner of Apple began , even today , the iPhone is the most important product of the Group .
Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , which ruled the market , had the after@@ no@@ ons .
finally , you disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the S@@ ages now have Apple and as@@ ian suppliers such as Samsung .
the smartphone is 20 years after its invention a self @-@ understanding .
on average each German now sees 88 times a day on his mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must all learn to draw the smartphone even once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina ball , in the Siemens executive board for personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent availability now applies as a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must head the Olympic spirit and h@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row is not only going to bring in our local communities and throughout London , but in all the country &apos;s renovation and pro@@ sper@@ ity .
for me , this was the biggest attraction of He@@ ath@@ row , just as it was in 2012 in London , when we had a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions of the games are benef@@ ited .
the Olympi@@ ad brought great advantages for Strat@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be reached by making new possibilities for local residents and companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
for our local communities we will already make 10,000 new apprentices , 40,000 new jobs , and the youth unemployment in the airport environment will prepare an end .
as they were ahead in London 2012 , there will be such that the challenge of the extension of He@@ ath@@ row is too big .
I told me that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be able to bl@@ ame for the world stage .
the two fl@@ es were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to over@@ sight , but He@@ ath@@ row answered every answer every question .
how the Olympic Games is He@@ ath@@ row for many and not a infrastructure project .
extension is an opportunity to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion at funny growth and a legacy of skills and employment in order to leave the airport as well as in whole GB .
we have a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has implemented a £ 11 bn savings program in time and budget , from T5 - the five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , up to T2 , which was built in the midst of the two frequencies of the world .
now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion to private investment .
London &apos;s London Olympic Games were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of He@@ ath@@ row is also to be one .
it &apos;s time to expand this Olympic spirit and He@@ ath@@ row , as well as in order to secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment creating the UK .

adop@@ ad Plus , Facebook in &quot; kit and mouse game &quot; regarding advertising block@@ age
for businesses who earn money with online advertising items , according to one of the software manufacturers attempts , merge blocking , a &quot; cat and mouse game . &quot;
on Thursday , just two days after Facebook announced that it would block the ad on his desktop page , adop@@ ting an B@@ log@@ Post , in which it could upgrade their filter to block advertising in the social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook announced that his desktop page would change the coding regarding his advertis@@ ements to identify it , which part of the side advertising is to be difficult to recognize .
but Ad@@ ad declared that it has found a new way to handle the new codes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a blo@@ g@@ post , the speaker of Ad@@ ad Ben Williams wrote that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her struggle between the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source Community and the revolution has already been possible since the invention of sco@@ ot@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and that it is possible to get Facebook with a new solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fact that the world &apos;s largest company for social media was launched in the struggle , is a strong indication for the industry , such as concern for wor@@ d@@ ingly stim@@ ul@@ ators of the industry .
according to a study conducted by Pa@@ ol@@ air and Adobe , about 200 million people are born around the world ; almost four times so much in 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion per day active users who can access Facebook over their mobile devices , hand @-@ advertisement 84 per cent of the value added fac@@ eb@@ ooks .
Moreover , the company has been upgraded to desktop computers , since mobile ad blocks no effect on Fac@@ eb@@ ooks mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ agra@@ m , divided a speaker .
advertising on Desktop PC makes a suff@@ ici@@ ently large proportion of revenue so that Facebook has to be worth worth it as worth it worth it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday Facebook with that there would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in@@ ference &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to update its people more control over them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Facebook has claimed that Ad@@ block add new filters , because they would also block content on the side that are no advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the users , this is no positive experience , therefore we are planning to access the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one spokes@@ man of Facebook in an e @-@ mail communication . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad block@@ ers are a bl@@ unt means why we have focused on development tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences to put more control into the hands of people .
woman in thought of suicide on Swiss fre@@ eway
the victim was in the middle of the night on the fre@@ eway .
the police calls for witnesses after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday at a suspected self @-@ suicide of several vehicles on a highway .
the incident happened at the A1 motorway near Morges in the canton of V@@ aud shortly after midnight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a woman in the dark &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a act of desp@@ air &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the road and were hit by several cars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police in V@@ aud . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is obvious that a Swiss stay at the age of 49 , which was driving of several vehicles , including a truck to drive , wanted to kill himself .
she died on site .
several drivers have already been heard , but some are still not identified , the police rejected these as well as any witnesses of the incident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it opened an investigation procedure , which is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; logical &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; step in one such situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter to Le Tribun@@ e de Gen@@ eve &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it remains to wait , if any of the drivers will be displayed .
was a cl@@ ash avoid@@ able ?
this is something that the prosecutor must decide , &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter .
two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers will not be moved to responsibility .
in each of the two cases - for which one person was in the dark on the highway - was decided that people don &apos;t need to go out that a pedestrian walk at night on the highway , as it was called in the newspaper .
last year , a polic@@ ew@@ oman was acquitted when she had over a man over and killed one night , which was near Pay@@ erne in August 2014 near Pay@@ erne in August 2014 .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victims had drunk , and has become conscious of the street @-@ conscious , the court has received .
the court noted that the polic@@ ew@@ oman -- that had responded to a not@@ ary way , was a &quot; perfect exceptional and un@@ predic@@ table situation , &quot; said the judge .
any further information about the incident happened on Thursday in the vicinity of Morges , the police must notify us at number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA climate model : Venus was once gu@@ arded
the Venus was probably inhab@@ itable with the projec@@ tions of a new NASA climate model probably .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus on tools and algorithms that resem@@ ble of clim@@ atic research .
the model was designed to determine whether the Venus could once enligh@@ tened with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ tight atmosphere .
scientists previously indicates that the slow revolution of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere .
but the newest simulation indicates that Venus could have a thin @-@ like atmosphere and yet slowly rotating .
the model also lit the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet thought probably more dry areas than the Earth , but had once enough water and ge@@ ographic vari@@ ability to accommodate life and easily irrit@@ ated before fast evap@@ oration .
the early Venus also benef@@ ited from a sun that matter 30 percent .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow revolution of Venus exp@@ ires its daily side of the sun for almost two months , &quot; G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io said in a press release .
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain , which creates a thick layer clouds , which is like a umbrella , to par@@ agli@@ ding the surface from most of the solar heat .
the result are average temperatures , which are some de@@ ers than the Earth today .
the model produced a history of Venus that resem@@ bles evolution of evolution that was previously assumed of plan@@ ets .
although they were probably resi@@ due to live , the Venus was exposed over the course of several billion years --@@ much heat and ultra@@ violet light .
their oceans are evap@@ or@@ ated and its water vap@@ or was burned from ultra@@ violet light .
as their Hydro@@ gen dropped only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus , which we know today .
the researchers part@@ ed the results of its new Venus climate model in the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy coming back as a coach of the Aval@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy came back on Thursday as a coach and Vice President of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado River and resulted in low participation in the decision process of the team .
alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will be looking for immediately after a new coach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last three years I have fulfilled my duties as chief trainer and Vice President of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and destination , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy coming in a position . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have thought in the course of summer long and much more , how I could improve this team to give it more depth to give it to a higher level . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to achieve this , the vision of the trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations must be perfectly matched to the organization .
he must also have a decision to decide on decisions which influence the performance of the team .
these conditions are not currently fulfilled .
Sak@@ ic , who founded the Roy on 23 May 2013 , thank him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; Patrick has informed me this decision , &quot; said Sak@@ ic .
we appreciated all what he did for our organisation and wish him only the best for the future .
Roy was honored during his debut season on the Aval@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of Jack Adam Awards as the best coach of the League .
he led the club to 112 points and in the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the Play@@ offs of Minnesota and missed the late season in each of the two last years .
the Aval@@ ok@@ ches recorded in the 2015 @-@ 16 season a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 mark and fell behind the wild for a second game card spot in the Western Conference around five points .
as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart , Roy has won four Stanley C@@ ups -- two pieces with Montreal , and the Aval@@ ok@@ che .
Nord@@ es@@ ee@@ cen@@ aries take talks again , put a strike out of
&quot; &quot; &quot; the workers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; workers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were exposed to the re@@ mun@@ eration for northern India workers , while all the dispute , for a new talk on the table , said the negoti@@ ator . &quot; &quot; &quot;
strikes against the Wood Field Company Wood Group were spor@@ adic on platforms in the North Sea , which are operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; Wood Group as well as the im@@ ite and r@@ ushing unions can confirm that we have agreed to rest@@ art the winding process of the current battle , &quot; says it in a joint statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will hold a few full day meetings over the next weeks which will begin the beginning of the next year to re@@ locate the problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , will protest against possible pay@@ outs by up to 30 percent .
the year of Wood Group applied the rates to his contrac@@ tors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market printing .
the company &apos;s rating policy follows a 10 percent decline for on@@ shore contrac@@ tors in 2014 .

in its part , Shell has dismissed and plans to aband@@ on his part of thousands of people , to share their oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries , as a result of its meg@@ ac@@ ret@@ inal relationship with the British energy company BG Group r@@ ational .
energy companies are due to the lower raw oil prices under pressure , an economic situation that had been reinforced by the British in June , the European Union had strengthened .
the Scottish parliament Dave Anderson met early this week with workers &quot; leaders to discuss one of the largest labour disputes which took place in the North Sea .
the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need a economy that works for many and not only for a few &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
2016 will be less than $ 1.4 billion for new projects in the North Sea by an average of around $ 7 billion in the past five years .
Ke@@ pler measures rot@@ ational speed of stars in stell@@ ations of the Ple@@ y@@ ades
astronom@@ ers helped Astr@@ onom@@ en &apos;s latest mission to collect the most complete catalog of rotation rates among the stars of the ob@@ jection of the Ple@@ j@@ ades .
the new data help to understand astronom@@ ers why stars are in star sp@@ read@@ ings out to different rates as well as in which connection the rot@@ ational inter@@ iors with the planet walls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope we know through the same results with other star@@ en@@ ings , more about the relationship between the mass of a mortality , its age and even the history of its solar system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the con@@ stell@@ ations of the Ple@@ y@@ ades is 445 light@@ years away from the Earth .
many stars appeared in this constellation , which occurred some 125 million years ago , reach the adult age .
they are now fastest on the fastest .
at peak rot@@ ation@@ rates this attack@@ ing star sp@@ ends large amounts of stars .
because these winds are travelling through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a slow effect on the stars .
when an star is aged , its rot@@ ational rate begins to slow down .
Ke@@ pler measures the rot@@ ational rate of each risk by taking the time between the appearance of a notable star spot -- as deck@@ ed -- .
the latest catalogue of rotation rates indicates that more than massive stars are slower than a less massive stars .
re@@ w compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with a bigger star slower pi@@ rou@@ ds lower than smaller .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ballet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let &apos;s see that slow rot@@ ors are willing to tend to be massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the star read@@ ings of the Ple@@ y@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cos@@ mop@@ olitan laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities like rot@@ ational rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the con@@ stell@@ ations of the Ple@@ y@@ ades has an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is still a lot ahead of us , as we would like to slow to slow how , and why stars mar@@ red its red ro@@ wers and so to speak their &quot; dancing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dancing &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Reb@@ ull and her colleagues have reported in detail on their latest analysis of rotation rates of the Ple@@ j@@ ades , which will soon be published in astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversi@@ al bas@@ eball Star mark
the tears ran at Alex Rodri@@ guez faster than the US bas@@ eball Star in the best days from Base to Base .
after his emotional recall dis@@ closure , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old professional will apply for the Tri@@ p@@ a Bay that would carry the tri@@ cot of his New York Y@@ an@@ ke@@ es for the last time .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say &apos; Good@@ bye &apos; , &quot; said the 14 @-@ time All @-@ Star Game Particip@@ ants of Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) .
Rodri@@ guez was elected to the most valuable player of the League , in 2009 he won the World Series with Y@@ an@@ ke@@ es .
he signed his signature under a tenth year contract since 2007 an annual 27 million US dollars annually .
until the end of the contrast on 31 December 2017 , he acted as a consultant and youth coach - with full content .
as a player the Rodri@@ guez pay@@ ed long time with performance .
with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for Seattle ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas ran@@ ers ( 2001 @-@ 2004 ) and since 2005 he made some mil@@ estones .
with the Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame @-@ members H@@ ank Aaron and Willi@@ e M@@ ays have only two other bas@@ eball player found similar values in the most important statistics .
yet the 41 @-@ year @-@ old could not be included in the rest of the bas@@ al hall .
for so successful Rodri@@ guez - nickn@@ ame &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; - in the field was so controversi@@ al that occurr@@ ence out of place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already in 2009 , the super@@ star reviewed by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which resulted in death between 2001 and 2003 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in August 2013 , he was closed for 211 games as part of a processing of the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ andal .
Rodri@@ guez is regarded as the main suspected , lasting for years to have received an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida .
after a dispute the lock was still reduced to 162 encoun@@ ters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the League could even have already done for the year 2014 , because I played 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rodri@@ guez said that at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also his f@@ arewell days are not dis@@ appointing .
while many bas@@ eball @-@ leg@@ ged in their last games once again received the big stage , Rodri@@ guez had to sit on the bench .
&quot; my job does not include any f@@ arewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job includes the attempt to win any game , &quot; et@@ te Y@@ an@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ard@@ i .

Olympia 2016 : Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are first di@@ op@@ ses
caught : because of a positive di@@ op@@ ing@@ sample , weigh@@ t@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski ( Poland ) must not start in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games will be over@@ sh@@ aded by the first official dos@@ ages .
one @-@ caught athl@@ ete would have won almost a medal .
before the seventh competition day the first official D@@ op@@ ing@@ ra@@ ids became the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
the Chinese swimming pool in Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter obst@@ acle course in Bulgaria and the Polish weigh@@ t@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski were positive in Brazil and is excluded - immediately prior to the beginning of the event , this news for the trouble .
at Ch@@ en was already proven the di@@ ure@@ tics of hydro@@ chlor@@ o@@ thi@@ azi@@ de , which is used as a mask containers for op@@ ing@@ ing components .
the International Sport Court of Justice CA@@ S confirmed on Friday afternoon with their exclusion from the Olympic Games .
on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ old took the fourth place in the final round about 100 m Butterfly , just by 0.0@@ 09 seconds , she missed the bronze medal .
on Friday , Ch@@ en would have to participate in the operations of 50 m Fre@@ estyle .
Ch@@ en requested the opening of the B @-@ Trial and an extradition hearing at the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the National association take the matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very serious and demands full cooperation in the investigations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted X@@ in@@ hua in a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will work with the International Sport Court of CA@@ S and will accept the judgement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in history , no longer the IOC but the CA@@ S is responsible for the sanctions of athletes with positive cases .
also in the night of Rio sick@@ bed the news about the positive sample at Dan@@ ek@@ owa , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went into the offensive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an incredible shock , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to Bulgarian TV channel B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is innocent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be nutritional supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the athlet@@ ics &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; athlet@@ ics &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report , it is said to act in the prohibited substance by the EP@@ O of blood d@@ op@@ ing@@ stuffs .
Dan@@ ek@@ owa was temporarily suspended , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ Trial should have already been positive .
Bulgarian Prime Minister Bo@@ jko Bor@@ is@@ sow joined the athl@@ ete about the athl@@ ete about the athl@@ ete .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes are not able to go &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We are Bulg@@ arians under observation , so many have been excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , all weight weigh@@ t@@ lif@@ ter from the chron@@ ically d@@ op@@ ulated nation is not allowed to participate in Rio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event was also known as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in class up to 85 kg , like his brother Tom@@ as@@ z has been positive for three days earlier on the an@@ ab@@ olic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ rol@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they will be competing , however , they are not allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg .
before the start of the athl@@ ete , Dan@@ ek@@ owa is one of the case of serious blow for the Rep@@ utation of the entire sport .
the World @-@ association IA@@ AF had the complete Russian team to start an exception because of systematic D@@ op@@ ings the start , also the farmers in Kenya produces numerous bad news .
in the bu@@ oy@@ ancy chamber , the previous failure in China had also been cat@@ ered for severe con@@ disputes between athletes .
thus the Fr@@ ench@@ man Camil@@ le Lac@@ our@@ t hat@@ ch the Chinese Olympic Champion Sun Yang har@@ sh .
&quot; sun Yang p@@ ink@@ elt l@@ ila . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I see the podium over 200 m Fre@@ estyle I want to pass , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lac@@ our@@ t said in the French radio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was also at the heart of a debate with the Austr@@ ali@@ er M@@ ack H@@ orton .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for D@@ oping @-@ bet@@ rot@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was tested for the Chinese championships in 2014 , but had to have been tested on the stim@@ ul@@ ans Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din but only had a three @-@ month sper@@ ity .
Dat@@ enk@@ lau : so per@@ fi@@ de @-@ press h@@ acker you ran@@ s@@ om their ran@@ s@@ om
programmer from press malware attack currently targeted companies - and are successfully successful .
according to a recent survey of the malware infection specialist Mal@@ op@@ eb@@ ooks under 540 companies in North America , UK and Germany were 40 percent of survey@@ ed companies in the past twelve months at least once , partial victims of a attack with pres@@ sur@@ fers .
in Germany , almost 20 percent of companies had already achieved a target of a R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware battery .
40 per cent of the victims of the victims , demanded by the perpet@@ rators which could use the challenged systems and data to be able to use the challenged systems .
the perpet@@ rators speci@@ alize their pres@@ sive software according to the observ@@ ations of Mal@@ war@@ fs based on attacks in the company network .
if they are successful there , the potential free ran@@ s@@ om benefit is significantly higher than with private users .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we observe a quick evolution of pollutants software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mal@@ war@@ rior @-@ b@@ oss Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ ń@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2008 most mal@@ war@@ e@@ programs have been designed to send advertis@@ ements .
then discovered the perpet@@ r@@ ator software for itself .
only Privat@@ us@@ er were the target , but the change went out to the company in the past months .
R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware works after a simple pattern : once active on the computer of an victim , she sear@@ ches after un@@ interrupted files such as WordPress , Ex@@ cel@@ - or database files , as well as archives of pictures and videos .
these files en@@ codes the R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustainable .
then the software presents the requirements of pres@@ sur@@ fers .
to get the final key code to the files , the victims must have money - mostly in the form of the cryp@@ tion Bit@@ coin - .
but where private use the personal photo database on the game , it goes to companies with sensitive customer data or project databases without which the production is shut down .
accordingly , the damage falls off if a r@@ ans@@ om@@ ware suggests .
22 percent of the affected German companies reported waste losses due to R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware , 13 percent had to be even worse , in one case , people were living in life .
in Germany there were already several hospitals in attacks of attacks , whose patients may be threatened by loss of symptoms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are always say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pays off , you only promotes the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains K@@ lec@@ zy@@ ń@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but 80 to 90 percent of firms , paying , will receive their data again .
for managers , it is difficult to refuse to re@@ ject the requirement of the offen@@ ders in the operation .
the h@@ acker again wants to know and try to build a good reputation .
in a recent study , the security for@@ gers of F @-@ Secure exam@@ ines the usage surfaces and the contact with the pres@@ sur@@ fers and come to the result : the perpet@@ rators are actually trying to set up a kind of customer service to take more money .
you explain their victims per chat on how they can pay by bit@@ coin , freely available support websites one or de@@ cryp@@ t free example files .
and they will be redeemed for payments of a few hundred euros , company will have to pay attention in hard and five @-@ digit sum@@ s to de@@ cryp@@ t their data .
given the potential high and relatively risk profit from the R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware defic@@ iency , the h@@ acker will always share professional and share their work , explains the Security provider SO@@ PH@@ OS : &quot; a single person can write a R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware about within a week . &quot;
it is more likely to be about three or four people .
the programmer sell their damage software then in the form of a software modular to the actual compression .
the previous malware kits produced by malware themselves , advice and additional tools for a single , fixed price between 1000 and 10.000 dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delivery includes a custom@@ ization , so that smaller configurations , appearance and bran@@ ding can be changed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wis@@ ni@@ ewski says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pres@@ ser will then look further ch@@ ipper for spreading the newly introduced software under the victims .
we live in a service industry .
so , in one of the for@@ ums , one bu@@ ys the set of a crime and commissioned a further to install the software on as many PCs .
the payment is done by using calcul@@ ator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last@@ ly , the crimin@@ als then sp@@ ammer is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ewski &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the risk of R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware is known to many companies that get their data better .
more than 50 percent of companies @-@ related companies in the Mal@@ war@@ ovski survey have confidence to re@@ vo@@ ke R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware by file @-@ back @-@ ups and sc@@ anners .
the perpet@@ rators are pursu@@ ing new strategies .
&quot; if the encryption of data alone is no adequate threat to successful vom@@ iting , the perpet@@ rators instead with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or price @-@ calculations , &quot; explains Mal@@ g@@ eb@@ ooks @-@ CEO Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski .
according to the type of data , the potential of damage , according to the type of data , is more multiple than before .
in the future , the perpet@@ rators could also take completely new targets on the Internet of Things ( s ) .
on the h@@ ack@@ er@@ conference Def@@ con demonstrated safety researchers , as they were able to obtain thermo@@ stat under their control .
in the middle of the winter , the activation of a der@@ art blocks could be quite a ran@@ s@@ om benefit .
if the perpet@@ r@@ ator then instead of heating in the future a whole production line in a factory could block R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware also in Industry 4.0 .
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and easy @-@ to @-@ use
in the small HR @-@ V , Honda wants to pack everything : a bit SUV , a little coupé and even the versat@@ ility of a min@@ iv@@ ans .
sounds pretty good , but the HR @-@ V that was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz was actually extremely flexible in everyday life .
although the only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V is rather small , passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the rear , it really works closely .
the materials of the interior space are well processed and works in pleas@@ antly , only the cockpit @-@ top falls below .
more versatile than comparable vehicles is the HR @-@ V at the storage box .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not just a trunk of 453 l when provided and 10@@ 26 l when folded back inver@@ ted back , but there is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is less mag@@ ically , than it sounds : the seat areas of the re@@ bank can be folded as chin chairs and thus offer storage room that is up to ceilings 1,@@ 24 m high .
the trunk compartment can be loaded well , however , the charging height of 650 mm is higher than comparable Peugeot in 2008 .
the 1.6 @-@ l diesel engine with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR @-@ V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide range of rotation ranges .
he is likely to judge his work , however .
the daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is gr@@ ati@@ fying .
there is still another engine ization : a 1.5 l gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
the bike is balanced , a good compromise between dynam@@ ism and comfort .
but the steering is likely to be direct .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the equipment can be opened in the tested top variant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Executive &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the city emergency braking system is one of the city emergency braking ( operating speeds up to 32 km ) , the coll@@ ision system and trace @-@ assistant .
sometimes , the coll@@ ision appeared sometimes , because in the ran@@ man@@ e many obstacles are evaluated as &quot; her@@ edit@@ ary objects . &quot;
very reliable works of the remote @-@ light assistant .
and the intelligent speed controller respon@@ ds to traffic sign detection and fore@@ s@@ sel@@ t when needed .
the full connectivity is only available for the top facilities : 7 @-@ inch touchscreen , Nav@@ i , App integration and more .
two USB@@ - and one HDMI socket lie below the arm@@ rest and are therefore a bit aw@@ k@@ ward .
the approximately 29@@ 000 Euro for the well @-@ featured top diesel are fine .
who doesn &apos;t want to invest in so much will get the petrol from 20000 Euro , diesel of 23@@ ,000 euros .
the engines comply with the Euro @-@ 6 emission standard .
with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday suit@@ ability car .
Airline does not be adher@@ ence : down@@ fall on the airport
a Airline is not liable for the fall of a Travel@@ er on the passenger bridge .
because there is no liability for dangers conc@@ ei@@ v@@ able , which are typical for air traffic , argu@@ ed the Düsseldorf Higher Regional Court ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) .
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff had broken off with the fall of a k@@ nee .
however , the accident could happen throughout , however , it should be a general risk of life like judgment .
the airline had no compensation to the man .
disease : when paid the event
after their journey would only get money back when the cause of the disease is to be found in the hotel .
but this is only the case , if more than ten percent of the guests rate the same symptoms show .
in the promised case , a family on the second day of her Turkish bath l@@ ur@@ k was severely affected by di@@ arr@@ he@@ a and vom@@ iting .
she spent almost the entire holiday in the room .
their disease led the vac@@ ation@@ ists to a defective cler@@ k , which allegedly poll@@ uted se@@ a@@ water .
the family was the view , its journey was f@@ law@@ less - and mour@@ ned for the organis@@ er .
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs had no success .
the se@@ wage system was indeed defective .
but the organ@@ izers knew not just before departure of the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs .
he had to go out till then that the se@@ a@@ water was fine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he did not viol@@ ates his information obligations , so their decision . &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially in the samples of water no so@@ iling were found .
the disease of several hotel guests - maybe due to suit among themselves - is a general risk of life .
there were only 38 dise@@ ased with 6@@ 91 guests .
&quot; &quot; &quot; de Mai@@ zi@@ ère said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after refugees conf@@ used violence in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July many people had worry about further proposals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the state has been so@@ ber and finally decided to re@@ stop terrorism .
safe is : our country will not answer the power of perpet@@ rators and split .
we will not succeed the terror@@ ists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when offen@@ ders to leave the country , increase the safety and strength , also the consent of the population for refugee policy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère wants to reach the 2017 Bundestag election campaign .
he also announced another person@@ alised rein@@ forcement of security forces , namely &quot; in medium four @-@ digit magn@@ itude over several years . &quot;
sympath@@ ize with terrorism again under punishment .
video surveillance should be improved , the weapon could be so nov@@ iti@@ zed that , especially the purchase of weapons will be worth in the internet .
the last much @-@ discussed silence is intended for doctors to stop Mai@@ zi@@ ères after de Mai@@ zi@@ ères .
however , in dialogue with the sleeves , he will search for solutions that can be reduced by endang@@ ering the citizens , he said with a view to psych@@ ic leaves .
to counter@@ act a radi@@ cal@@ ization of refugees , the minister holds a better social support for themselves .
teachers have to better be prepared to deal with traum@@ ati@@ zed people .
for the persecution of crimin@@ als in special fields of the Internet ( Dar@@ k@@ net ) , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning an investig@@ ative investig@@ ator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD CEO Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to speak about everything that contributes to safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is important that the Minister of Interior has declared clearly against action .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a ear@@ nest for the hin@@ ge system in CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gabriel told the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke media group ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had rejected Ru@@ fe from the Union to a Bur@@ ka prohibition and the abol@@ ition of a double citizenship previous year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a general prohibition of complet@@ eness should be extingu@@ ished by the constitu@@ ent problem .
one can &apos;t offer everything you refuse and I rest the carrying out of the Bur@@ ka .
there you can talk about rules regarding road traffic or witnesses .
green Chief of Simone Peter designed his minister , to sim@@ ulate the facts and ability to sim@@ ulate new anti @-@ terror packages .
left @-@ party author Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; fleet pro@@ ver@@ bs and a tim@@ esc@@ ence of the stay bring the people in this country no more safety . &quot;
more traffic flow on the motorway s@@ g@@ inger
it looked regularly on the road - here a picture of November .
but this should change : the legal matter should be extended .
this is a good news for all car cyclists , who stand in the professional traffic on the surrounding street every evening in the St@@ au when they sail on the auto@@ clave ( A 43 ) .
the road building will be extended on Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between the Hammer Straße , and exit Wes@@ er Road by 700 meters .
car can then drive directly from the Hammer Straße to the right .
the major advantage : the transport divi@@ des early on how the total transaction is improved on the complex section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 .
the idea with the extended exit was the CD@@ U Group in the district of Münster @-@ West .
driving on the fe@@ eder is nervous that drivers especially between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
the back@@ drop goes back to the bridge over the Alber@@ go road and sometimes also beyond .
reason is the pin door at the B 51 short before the Wes@@ er Road .
from here traffic will only be tra@@ ded on the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be returned in front of good three @-@ quarter years ago .
the reason : static calculations had shown that the bridge has no more the necessary load capacity to absor@@ b the heavy traffic in terms of heavy traffic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long will this eng@@ age and the related sten@@ edi@@ an increase will not say , the responsible state may not say . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however at the age of 20 : for the bridge has an official remaining use of 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the legal status of the law , the country &apos;s bu@@ oy@@ ancy consci@@ ously exists for the holidays during the school holidays , because with disabilities .
the traffic will be guided on Tuesday and Wednesday in Wednesday and on Wednesday .
intercultural Journey : cultural offers for schools
the international class of Wald@@ schule attended the theater performances &quot; The invisible house . &quot;
the Association N@@ IMA &apos;s and the Young Theatre is planning a musical project now .
the Association N@@ IMA &apos;s allows for young people with migration and refugee camp , cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; class International &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Wald@@ schule &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wald@@ schule is an idea of winning &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The invisible house &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Young theatre of Münster . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the context of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was attended by 19 students between eleven and 15 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the year , the association has set up the cultural integration of young people with mig@@ rant and refugee grounds , schools with welcome groups have the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster .

relaxing night : tips for sleeping disorders
in the evening it is always heated around , at night you could no longer think of sleep in the morning , in the morning it is no longer thinking about sleep .
this is all other than relaxing .
after all , one is with such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adult sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces and more than ten percent can find her sleep frequently or permanently relaxing .
how do sleep problems or sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces ?
there are several forms of sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces , and there are many different causes underlying , emphas@@ ises Hans @-@ Günter We@@ e@@ ß , member of the German Society for Anim@@ als and Sle@@ ep Medicine .
what you understand , however , is the in@@ som@@ nie , so an in@@ let and as@@ le@@ ep .
just the di@@ as@@ le@@ ep feel many people as un@@ satisfactory or in@@ adequate , says Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht , member of the German domestic medical association with practice in the Lower Saxony Var@@ el .
what is behind Sle@@ eping disorders ?
the causes of sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces are complex .
behind it , organic , mental or behaviour @-@ related factors , but also pres@@ cription medic@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not rarely is the sleeping expression of a different condition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early wake up is frequently occurring in a depression &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says We@@ e@@ ß . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it may be that different factors have become one another .
who , for example , has a her@@ ni@@ ated disc , are bad@@ ly lying , w@@ akes every two to three hours and begins to gre@@ edy about all day problems and ensure to gre@@ edy about everyday problems , there is a good example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
as of when should you sleep with sleep to a doctor ?
those who do not sleep for a period of one month in at least three nights per week , should be imp@@ aired , should go to the doctor , we@@ dge We@@ e@@ ß .
the impair@@ ment can look quite different : one is beaten , tired , un@@ locked , has difficulties with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has tuning fluctu@@ ations or physical complaints like stomach or head@@ aches .
in order to alle@@ vi@@ ate the sleep disorder , it is important to find out their causes .
as treatment options , behavi@@ oral behavior , a cogn@@ itive behavi@@ oral therapy , or other medicines - classic sleep tablets only in exceptional cases and no more for two weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deep sleep &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany there is hard to emphas@@ ises Prof. Ingo Fi@@ xed , leader of the interdisciplinary medical center of the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore you should first contact with sleeping difficulties at first at home , av@@ eng@@ ing we@@ e@@ ß .
it can clari@@ fy with investigations whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should come into sleep laboratory , and what happens ?
for examination in sleep lab@@ s , medicine for instance with re@@ spir@@ atory failure , for sleeping ti@@ red@@ ness , with sleeping ti@@ red@@ ness or if one does not find the cause of a di@@ as@@ le@@ ep , explains Fi@@ bre .
we do not need to prepare for the study .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; only please do no lunch , &quot; says Fi@@ bre .
after the cl@@ ab@@ ling you enter into the bed at its normal time .
besides the electrodes on the body you are wearing a nas@@ al glasses , a chest strap and a finger @-@ finger on fingers .
in addition , a camera shows the ceiling to the sleeping corner .
how can people bring problems in the handle ?
there are quite many screws , one can set for a better sleep .
We@@ e@@ Is counts on : regular sleeping and current times , not too long in bed , do not sleep on the day , not watching television to sleep , alcoh@@ ol@@ den , and at night not at the watch , then the day begins to be reck@@ oned , and that &apos;s all and not eligible .
what the jung@@ le camp with lack of medals made for swimming
the former German s@@ wimm@@ ers Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has expressed himself on Facebook to dis@@ appointing the DS@@ V teams in the Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 , he brought gold for the first time in Doha at the short time and set up his first record record at the same time .
now the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ let Markus D@@ ei@@ bler via Facebook has been placed in front of his criticism of ex @-@ team@@ work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a country where an Olympic champion gets 20,000 € award and a jun@@ k king 150.000 € should no wonder about missing medals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on Friday in his Facebook page . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conveyor system in swimming @-@ sport is po@@ or@@ ly , the d@@ op@@ ing@@ controls , however , very good .
with that we can not compete with countries who do not support much and do it even in the topic D@@ oping , or even to operate it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls should be discontinued , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
wanted to start a com@@ eback , D@@ ei@@ bler would have already been reported nine months before his first start of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( NA@@ DA ) .
it is exactly how to keep it with countries .
&quot; whoever cannot enter a certain time prior to the World Cup / OS of independent control agencies of WA@@ DA / F@@ INA , must not participate , the Hamburg choice calls for an ice@@ bergs .
airport : bonds of Bag@@ gage
professional th@@ ieves on the airport Düsseldorf
on Thursday the arrest of Düssel@@ dor@@ fer Police reached the arrest of two women and two men at the age of 50 to 61 years .
the facts had committed as bonds and luggage sealing ring .
at 21.@@ 30 a.m. the civil servants in the area of Düsseldorf Airport knew a ban@@ de that was known to the polic@@ emen from past theft s@@ me@@ ats .
two women and two men had perpet@@ rated this year since mid @-@ July this year , and were very professional , practi@@ ced and practi@@ ced profession@@ ally .
the Speci@@ alists of Cri@@ me Com@@ miss@@ ariat 34 can sail to the Di@@ ving of criminal off@@ ences after Germany . four acts were noted .
they took over 15,000 Euro in total .
old buildings , some linear pav@@ ement , in between another head@@ stone pav@@ ement : the Rig@@ id street in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain works not so on the first sight , but the police counts it among the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
if you go along the east from east to west , you arrive at game places , a refresh@@ ed kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ades .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to the facade of a grey house anyone has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ug@@ ly ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
opposite to a Li@@ dl , who also soon to be demolished , will be built here : by 2017 , a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be created here .
article about this &quot; trendy district &quot; as the responsible real estate company Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain , however , are usually illustrated with burning cars in the last weeks .
the reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was busy , now the residents of rental contracts , in the ground floor are still occupied , but are used for events .
since the beginning of the year , the Berlin inside of Berlin had several times more than for a tough pre @-@ going police against the project , the area as &quot; no @-@ go zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 signi@@ fies as a starting point of autonomous violence .
after 22 June the rooms were cleared on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede , with 300 police officers , had pat@@ rol the police three weeks with 30 to 40 civil servants and three team @-@ cars , closed parts of the street , and kept visitors from them to enter the house with the number 94 .
meanwhile , the renovated construction worker on behalf of the unknown owner @-@ owner has the rooms .
on 13 July , a Berlin administration Court decided that the rem@@ over was illegal . and one day later moved police and workers under the Ju@@ bel of sympath@@ izers and residents .
on this summer afternoon the streets are peaceful : parents walk to children , people sit on the office in front of the houses in the sun , others keep the front spo@@ ils .
in the immediate vicinity of the skin , a primary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens .
left violence is not the main concern of many an@@ ians : K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in the Kiev , and J@@ ana * , who goes up here three children , are primarily committed by the police presence .
with the inhabitants of the skin subjects , they share the concern for rent and genetic .
it doesn &apos;t sound like a Kie@@ z , who wanted to un@@ wanted poli@@ omyel@@ itis in front of v@@ and@@ alism on the left .
the tr@@ ench , which the Berliner Inn@@ ens@@ en@@ ator and the police between houses and their neighbours , obviously not exist .
Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working area , which is also today in comparison to the rest of the city , an average salary and a high risk of poverty .
also houses and other new@@ born resi@@ du@@ es are already a long time to the Kiev : in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied by the former GDR , including almost the entire Main@@ zer street near the Rig@@ a@@ er .
while the ma@@ zer had been cleared among a large police battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alised in the Rig@@ id and are still inhabited by people today , who had occupied them 26 years ago .
at the same time , the district has become increasingly on the mag@@ nets for tourists and elec@@ ri@@ liner from around the world : with them the inhabitants of GDR times and former house he became their Kiev .
this also makes for rent a remarkable , which has risen by nearly 60 percent since 2009 .
many of the new@@ buildings in the Rig@@ id will be attacked as symbols for this development : they recognize them into checked slices or fresh@@ ly coated fac@@ ades , which were subjected to colours .
no other street has been mentioned so often together with the words &quot; lin@@ ks@@ autonomous violence . &quot;
a reason for that not all neigh@@ bors could see the problem that they are not necessarily affected by the crime : off@@ ences such as body viol@@ ate statistics , statistics are almost exclusively against polic@@ emen .
the largest part of the offen@@ ders make atomic damage , the ten@@ ds rather the newly built and newly renovated houses .
for K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer , which has been living in a rental house next to the controversi@@ al 94 years , no speech can be given by un@@ certainty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what acts of violence is weigh@@ t@@ ful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people in the 94 are their neigh@@ bors who have not been intended . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also the famous burning cars will give it right in the Rig@@ id already longer .
for those studied architect , her street is no criminal focus , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps each other , lives together on the street and gets more apart , then somewhere else . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is consci@@ ously drawn into the Rig@@ id street - and stayed .
therefore it was so important that the residents receive their road : from the police , politics and the media , all suddenly stressed the De@@ ut@@ ory on the district in July .
but in the eyes of inhabitants like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road will continue to be taken away : by spl@@ utter new buildings in former building g@@ aps , that over@@ took the old inhabitants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the last con@@ domin@@ iums , which are not interesting for many , - here are people who are not so well as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; violence and destruction I cannot be gu@@ arded . &quot;
but what should one do when someone listening to someone ?
since then , there is a str@@ ation on all sides of fru@@ str@@ ation , even with the police and the inhabitants .
for Zu@@ c@@ zo@@ ic , who have more than colour bombs , K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer has somewhat understanding : the skin projects and the left scene belonged to the Kiev .
whoever draws up should be aware of itself - exactly like someone who moves into a bar area that can be bad@@ ly lam@@ ented over noise .
all only with pre @-@ names presented persons have asked to be called not with their right name
Ur@@ bach : An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is new refugees
An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact partner in the fields of integration and organizer .
in addition she is a social worker .
since July An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee commissioned for Ur@@ bach .
the social educ@@ ators support team in the administration of Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
you see as contact partner for all actors : refugees , workers , refugee aid , administration , authorities and who else is mis@@ mixed .
Reg@@ ine customer of the working group indicates that the volunteer are than@@ k@@ ful that Deu@@ ter@@ le is now da@@ zz@@ ling pleas@@ ures , that has a problem particularly .
for example , some - less sp@@ it rather than rather to the multitude of w@@ ishing responsibilities , meant to be expressed as managing the site wanted to write .
sought an administrative force with a talent for languages and people , joined with a long @-@ term experience in the field of social work , just a jeal@@ ous Woll@@ um@@ sau .
yet administrative work is not her central area , An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
above all , go to organisation , work with people on site and also behind the scenes and network activity .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been present for around six weeks .
she gave a 50 percent stake to three years .
&quot; it was high time &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer , says An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le Hon@@ or and haupt@@ ian actors supported .
there are large and small problems , organiz@@ ational , human and understanding problems .
soon new container in the Was@@ en@@ straße
a heavy problem exists since some time to find flats for the connecting @-@ fle@@ ets that have been recognized .
the commun@@ es are competent for the connection of the connection .
they must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented flats .
the cost of construction , rent or renovation of these accommodation you need to bear the commun@@ es itself .
the responsibility is moving from the Council of municipality to the commune and the job center .
problem : there are free objects , but not any owner wants to offer his apartment .
for some time , the search has been very difficult since some time .
de fac@@ to finds the administration not private apartments .
so far , it did not work so that you should be instructed in private apartments so Deu@@ ter@@ le .
therefore , these apartments have to be not@@ ori@@ ous , as it is called so beautiful .
so soon new containers are placed in the Was@@ en@@ straße .
but only with apartments it is not done .
perspective is the key@@ word , Reg@@ ine customer and An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
in addition to a permanent residence , there are trainees , training places , training places , one @-@ euro jobs and aid activities to refugees and migrants .
&quot; more places would be good &quot; reports Reg@@ ine customer .
many works in the building yard or help home star , do @-@ profit work - and the motiv@@ ated and very ti@@ dy , as An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reported .
it hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external effect .
this is &quot; no employment therapy &quot; .
work is not only work .
the day need a fixed structure , say Deu@@ ter@@ le and client .
people would have to develop a fe@@ as@@ ible experience .
so it offers offers such as sport , contacts with loc@@ als and especially language courses .
professional courses are ra@@ r .
you can also jump here administration and community community .
it is centrally that refugees get the feeling in Germany and wish to be welcomed in Germany .
long duration of the procedure is a problem .
you need to explain the refugees that it takes it to time , for example using language courses , for example .
whoever does not feel like that , he could not work in Ur@@ bach , do not work , and be un@@ profitable , who will never integrate it .
the distinct majority are motiv@@ ated .
problem claims , however , is the hon@@ est , &quot; people , in which nothing goes . &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and client is therefore always motiv@@ ating others to motiv@@ ate others .
all these have been a &quot; mamm@@ oth task . &quot;
a difficult question : did the two after the youngest inci@@ dents in front of radi@@ cal@@ ization , also in a small community like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the customer clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what lack of n@@ ai@@ f can name &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; a residual risk could be , but would not make them un@@ lock . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sen@@ si@@ bil@@ ites are the hel@@ per now .
these inci@@ dents were also the topic in refugees .
they had the fear that the assassination attempt in call it completely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you want to show that they don &apos;t have anything to do anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the customer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so the main and hon@@ our@@ ful place must be held on site and in the region of activities .
they always have in the background , that soon a new stores could come to refugees and migrants to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a limit ?
this question clearly aims to answer the policy .
actually , it is un@@ fair to put away hel@@ pers on site .
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we haven &apos;t arrived there where we would like , &quot; says An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
no new refugees , that would be able to relax .
Reg@@ ine customer also makes it clear that the Ur@@ b@@ acher has also been used to integrate the previous people working properly .
this is currently around 100 people , mainly young men .
but if people are in need , the women are able to help themselves .
the political world situation is so complicated , there are no easy answers .
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : Ein@@ brecher looking for Hel@@ icop@@ ter
the police helicopter flew over one hour from different areas - un@@ successful .
two unknown men are ge@@ ared towards 8.50 am on Friday morning in an apartment in a multi @-@ family house .
the inhabitants surprised the two and beat the un@@ hol@@ de into the escape .
the two men were about 1.@@ 65 to 1,@@ 70 meters in size , probably m@@ ashed , contributed both Blue@@ je@@ ans and black Kap@@ u@@ zen@@ pul@@ lis .
they are going towards the city centre .
as a consequence , the police used several strikes , as well as a police helicopter .
the ins@@ ure ran without success .
perhaps the unknown prior to the apartment was indeed close to the apartment and their escape .
