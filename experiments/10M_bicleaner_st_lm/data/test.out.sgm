<seg id="1">Clinics and Trumps Economic Policy Comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Invest in infrastructure and prevent trade agreements TTP - that want to be Clinton as well as trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the two US presidential addresses are incurred by the tax and energy policy as well as in a basic issue.</seg>
<seg id="4">The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a basic, more philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">He, about the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to keep in doubt rather small and warn before, as the state of economy can harm - with tax and regulation.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton establish the economy to death and regulate to death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">He himself would be different, asserted Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">He will return to regulate a stifficient tax reform, and is strong for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for businesses and businesses.</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton says, The state has given certain tasks to fulfil, he has disadvantageous chances to open and needs money.</seg>
<seg id="11">Therefore, the tax would be increased for the rich's wealth, says it.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the topic infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">Trump and Clinton become almost identical in the committees, say Trump and Clinton almost.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidates is announcing the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in the infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are rejected by the state-critical part-wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">So on Trump, we could still be part of internal discussions.</seg>
<seg id="17">Clearly visible are the differences in energy and climate policies.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal power plants and drive coal output in the U.S. again.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil extraction is also expected to be possible in so far protected areas to announce the Parisian climate agreement.</seg>
<seg id="20">Clinton intends to expand renewable energies with its investment program and calls: "one country will make clean energies over clean energies and jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "it will be either China, Germany or America - I want to be there." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only for infrastructure - even at international trade agreements, both competitors are not far away from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the Thine-Pacific Trade Agreements, will not sign them to sign.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time both the United States does not want to isolate international trade, but just safeguard American jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">That should then be paid better, about Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7.25 US dollars is a hunger-wage.</seg>
<seg id="27">She wants to increase her 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump in this question is to do is not quite clear: once again he says: the minimum wage must be down, then he says he will not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the coming months is probably likely to develop the fiscal policy of both bearings.</seg>
<seg id="30">On one side stands Trump, which aims to boost the economy and citizens to boost growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics keep his critics, so that the budgetary deficit would only be bigger.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand Clinton, who wants to ask at least of the rich men, wants to pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: a "Alliance of Foreign Affairs"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to announce his hands and proclaim an official end of the eight months "war of the words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin takes off his Turkish opponents in the gold-plated hall of St. Petersburg Palastes in reception, I cannot accept one of the printer that Ankara wants to reconcile this reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was the handler, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smiles worked as a malignant and he radiated heat from himself, even for his reuse conditions.</seg>
<seg id="7">On the other hand, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke from his "dear friend" Putin - according to a report whole five times.</seg>
<seg id="8">I could not count it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "he promised also that relations with Russia should not only return to their old level before the crisis, but even further improved." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan would like something like that would never happen something worse.</seg>
<seg id="11">His enthusiasm seemed to me to indicate the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's shining, sustainable bolle showed that the Russian state of Russia had not forgotten anything.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first, which he mentioned in his introductory game: the shooting of a Russian fighter by Turkey on the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow reaction to the time was wutentated.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin shared and accused Ankara, Russia in the back.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was even greater, because it was committed by a friend friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">The wire back to rebuild is hard, if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, the state-controlled media brought a fiery, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">Suddenly it seemed, when the Turks would bear the debt for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">The serious accusations of conductive officials reported that Erdogan's own family had benefited from illegal oil trading in the regions of Syria, which shall be controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He fought this vehement.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg, it was the official message that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, this meeting was just first took place because Putin received the debt of the President of Erdogan, who wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia was able to book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the advantages of an armistice are clear on the hand.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan needs all friends which he can get, after the last month in a failed coup d "état almost his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terror attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there is economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions met Turkey close - especially the prohibition of charter flights, which usually spend several million Russian tourists on the Turkish coast each year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has declined by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be facilitated if the flights will be resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They are count on a late seasonal harvest of the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week the State TV predicted cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports will be allowed again.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "a report in Vedemosti formulated this way:" "" "tourists are there long, tomatoes together here" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is located in the West as it is the response to the tried power of power when he tried to overtake power.</seg>
<seg id="38">To this, the lasting Groll on the negotiations for accession to the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the invent is to take advantage of the cool mood and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West.</seg>
<seg id="39">"" "" "" "the Russian state of State won a bonus in Ankara with security for ensuring that he requested" "" "état" "" "état for the selected state organs." ""</seg>
<seg id="40">This is a matter of Moscow to do a self-understanding that has changed even a deepest fear of rain.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this glorious palace that allowed Russia and Turkey, one, as it described me an analyst once, "two countries reject and feel poorly and feel bad.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still large differences between the two still.</seg>
<seg id="43">The largest difference is Syria, where Moscow has recently delivered the role as peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey would support each other side.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be noted that after almost three hours of first discussions both presidents spoke at the press conference, that they could not even have striped.</seg>
<seg id="45">The president of Turkey prevented it to answer a question about their differences while Putin decided to emphasise this.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus about it, where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of an open hostilities - and given the potential for a perfect disaster than NATO member Turkey shot the Russian martial jet - it is certainly better to talk to the two heads of state.</seg>

<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin was unwanted to release his Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov in like manner.</seg>
<seg id="3">Ivanov was a lot of years part of the most found confidentiality of Putin.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old was appointed as a special service for environmental and transportation services.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a statement by the Kremlin it reads that Putin have ordered his duties as chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration. "</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who had joined Ivanovs since 2012, was appointed to his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in Tallinn in Tallinn, Germany, in 1972, he graduated from the renowned State Department of Moscow for International Relations (MGIMO) at the renowned State of Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="9">At the website of the Kremlin it is (in Russian) that he later became the Chief Executive Officer and Stabseil manager of the government fees.</seg>
<seg id="10">On his appointment he said to Putin: "thank you for your trust."</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activities as a state of state and controls to implement your instructions." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin shared on the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov asked for this to leave his post and have recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Are the ridious faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysterious turniches.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov has been a long time of the most close confidence of Vladimir Putin and works as he was working for the Soviet secret service, KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff he was one of the most powerful men of the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin, broadcast on television, both men had claimed that the Chief of Staff came back on his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the weakening for cameras, only few of them are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So here is the result of a sort of power?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows that.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official assertion - that a man who once wanted to commended as an potential president again, I would like to lead to Russian environmental policy - joined big scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks on Putin, which will be cited on the website of the Kremlin, said Ivanov, "that I asked you at the beginning of 2012 in an interview, I could tell me that very complicated - one could rely over four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turned out, I've been chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov recorded the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Before he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and Putin's former member of the KGB State Security Service.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Bundessianic service (FSB), the KGB, Ivanov was appointed to his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin reached power, he held Ivanov as one of five people whom he confided in most.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once supposedly, Ivanov was elected president of Russia after Putin's second term, as a third term of Putin would have violate the constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this item was taken from a further, near allies of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin was Prime Minister, before he became the president for three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="10">We are all the witnesses of a engineering manship of a truly epic measure in this project with more than 30.000 ton of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the wire between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a heikle activity, which require extremely precise tolerances for the fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">All in all, almost 79% of the total bridging in their place and the last section of the decks gets to the deck today in Rosyth, which means that the deck is ready to be lifted to its square on the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="13">Michael Martin, project leader of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said: "the first closure represents a considerable milestone in each bridge project.</seg>
<seg id="14">With this fantastic project, the clasp is looking forward to trendsetting and deep structure.</seg>
<seg id="15">After installation of the last streak-section and its connection with the Northern Nordturmdeck, we had to close the gap to the north or the north side.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by pulling the northern edge of 700 millimeters south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and very hot activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massively, as the viaduct 222 meters long, weighs approx. 6,000 tons and a gradient of approx. 3% has to be moved up.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness, worth it</seg>
<seg id="2">It's intriguing to see how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">That teens and child to play no longer go outside, but rather would prefer to spend their leisure time to spend on screens, was complained in the last decade of many.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "at Pokemon Go to get people from the sofa to get active and active." ""</seg>

<seg id="6">Therefore it's great to see that technology and activities are unilaterally exclude in the open air.</seg>
<seg id="7">I'm interested in the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app that is based on the characteristics which initially created for the video games in the 1990s (later created a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">How many phenomena of pop culture decreased slightly ahead of the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand in early July.</seg>
<seg id="9">In other countries, the market launch was postponed by massive demand, overload the server.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days, Pokémon Go has more users as an inks and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, players with their smart phones after outside and search for Pokémons that are following with a GPS and once they were found once again, "photographed" (about a screenshot on the phone) or "taken."</seg>
<seg id="13">One generation that played the game when she was still younger, joined the tap and jumped to the search of the sofa.</seg>

<seg id="15">Cardiac, an app for Apple Watch, followed by the Washington Post recently with that within two days after launch of the game, the number of persecuted people who jumped every day 30 minutes, jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company doesn't know who plays Pokémon Go - it merely look for the performance improvement.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "many public educational campaigns to take care of" "" "30 minutes" "" "to take part of the sofa" "" "to be active each day" "" "and" "" "every day actively" "" "would be deaf" "", "because many public messages are boring to health and to come from people who look back." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">Yet, the importance of sport not to be assessed.</seg>
<seg id="19">Those who drives regularly, reduces its chances to developing cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps with weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of advantages to bring them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the miracle of Pokémon Go is that people bring a thing to do something in the open thing that fun is fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus, three pillars of health covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine, as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people close the hunt even new friends.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always there are mecologically game originality, which must always be harder over something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could run against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What should it be?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if smartphone apps had previously been able to track our activity earlier than Fitbit, they gave us no reason to do sports, as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">New will lose his appeal and the use will be followed by time.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, due to the Pokemon success, there will be more Games to be able to transform apps and virtual reality with the activity in the real world, and will be able to help many people on the hunt, active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="4">If the Parliament election will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays, the focal point has decided already in the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">For more than so far, it does not work: summer vacation, heat and land battle - that blows itself.</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals that are convinced by the election are to be convinced by holiday.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most of the tourists who are in the country are on Usedom, Rügen, or Hiddensee, are no locals, so not allowed to choose the country.</seg>
<seg id="8">We get practical problems: in the holiday there are helpers, flashing the posters, flashing the balloons, flyers and count towards the end of the vote, only tired.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until the 4th of September, 2016, the election and the last day of the route, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has to leave once again electoral struggle over the people.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase, if you can say that at all, has just started.</seg>

<seg id="19">It has invited twice German Chancellor Angela Merkel to major exploration, Merkel of the German Bundestag team in the northeastern.</seg>

<seg id="28">Because there stands a lot on the game, Sellering has called his SPD to become a particularly dedicated electoral struggle.</seg>
<seg id="29">In polls the Socialists and Democrats were last modified 22 percent behind partner CDU (25) and just ahead of AfD (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">At the election of 2011, the SPD had already won with 35.6 percent in front of the CDU (22).</seg>

<seg id="2">Lonely men love medium-aged plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you go to the commeneil in order to overlend him under the pseudonym-Alleapst Men with rying Believres, this statement leads themselves from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the most comprehensive recovery of records did not want to welcome to a boom in millennials, who want to welcome the future of physical objects, but back on mid-life nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who have purchased a record, are all foresight according to the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">Indeed, the age group of 18-24 is the most likely cat group.</seg>
<seg id="7">There is also no hordes by leisure runners - it has an emotional meaning: older plate buyers retain their feelings rather for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it alone time (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But agree the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog would be a news report on TV, I would like to follow the camera while I bear in the midst of a busy street in Soho, a modest ones before I stand to stop my hands and a little bit like: "so let's leave us a closer look."</seg>
<seg id="10">So let's throw a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even if the heart of SoHos is slow at its charm, hotels, restaurants and offices are now complete the buildings where independent sellers were resident there - there's been a handful of fantastic plate stores.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the camera of camera to switch the camera for the next part, in which I am in the immediate vicinity of different men in such stores, and try to assess their age and mood by observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, to the name of Sister Ray (data number: two young women, three men mean age) into the Reckless Records (data number: eight males, middle-aged people), is probably a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through shops in order to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is it a collectors that I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I think," he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates.</seg>
<seg id="17">These sound plates, above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I was not followed him, followed by the walls of his room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why it owns an important number of albums and singles, the result of his available income: it is now in the position to buy records, which he was able to buy and again buy items, which he sold, when he was young and pleite.</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy, are from the late 1960s, early '70s, which was released when I was 11 or 12. things I thought something too young was to buy them," he says.</seg>
<seg id="20">He is true that those who want to buy the plates, have rather unusual, and would like to spend some time alone, and adds: "I don't smoke and I drink not much.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my faster.</seg>
<seg id="22">Wez, 25, working at Sister Ray, believes also that many customers who hits the YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, he has also noticed a new wave of people who have influenced by the Medienhpe, people who have heard about the comeback and have set themselves to buy their old records.</seg>
<seg id="24">For the conversations that I have conducted, people usually have escaped as of 1998 or 1999 of their collection.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs, sell their CDs again, in order to buy their records, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">That would explain the boom of the record collector of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional meaning?</seg>
<seg id="28">It only takes some seconds in a business such as phonica, to recognize that record stores offers a soothing community of equine innings.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to Wez, some of the older customers participated in the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some plate fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and would like to return to the stability of familiar sound quality envelopes, from objects that are happier.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "I think it can be the colt of a living or possession of material property than a kind of comfort," "" "says Wez." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">That is with me as a collector and I think it is so many people so.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to employ spiritually.</seg>
<seg id="34">"we are like their social worker!" soluble a staff from a record stack.</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey of ICM revealed in April that almost 50% of people who have purchased a record for the last month they have not heard.</seg>
<seg id="36">The poll found out that 41% have had a record player that they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record, have no record player.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report I would probably look very concerned while I blacks with a stack of Bossa Nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who has been working with the sounds of the Universe (number of data: three men, middle-aged men) has noticed a "trophy" of the Revirens.</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone came just here, and said:" I don't have a record player, but I would like to buy a radii sound plate, so that I can put it into the shelf, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage but it will definitely happen.</seg>
<seg id="41">More productive relies, less musikles.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have those who say: "I have no record player."</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older who are just getting up slowly.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fopp, dedicated to the Schallplatten ates almost one floor, has a blower audience as I go.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around 70, tourists who make photos, teenagers and women aged aged.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is less relaxed than in the aforementioned shops - Wild Beast is the latest synthesized and sextful pop instead of experiments - is it good to see such diversity in the customer.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them sees, especially lonely, but nagmental traumata are badly fixed, if you stand for 30 seconds next to someone.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been running in the business for a few minutes and considered the variety of plates available for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It's more a mannequin as a big one.</seg>
<seg id="50">They deserves not much, therefore the collecting of records did not make any real option, says it.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs much.</seg>
<seg id="52">It is easy to listen to music from a computer or other way, but the beauty of slabs is... "it drives with a dared epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="53">I do not know how to explain it - it is really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a shop that is said to have inspired a new generation of record-lovers: urban outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I give the note that Jeans Hotpants watches, I observe a group of young teenagers who grouped for one moment around Polaroid cameras, before a father and his daughter survived, a Crow record player.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left, there is a staircase, a wall full of records of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a blend of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">Nobody sees her - perhaps because they are only purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to set her.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that any attraction for these objects would mean more money for the industry, and some customers like to send the depths SoHos for more, there is nothing to be chargeable to itself.</seg>
<seg id="60">There is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others, which is, most suitable for deluxe objects such as labs.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even if my research projects showed that the results of YouGov, they leave, at least in place-shops in Soho, the large number of female collectors and record lovers who exist in reality, record business and online in Onlineforums.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard in school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They will spend their Thursday morning with security not covered by record stores of the Berwick Street and the leaves through records, while at the starrushing glance at a glance, 30-year old false presenter, who gets nothing out of old men aged Middle-old age.</seg>

<seg id="2">The impressive performance of Britain at the 7-day Rugby came in the final on Thursday evening to a rupted stop at the last hurdle in the form of Fijis, when they were defeated in Rio with a result of 43-7 at Deodoro Stadium.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji had a master class in the handling, side-stepping, squeezing, liner and raw power to win gold - their first Olympics in any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was dispatched through the silver medal of silver medal - Great Britain on this day - and they could definitely be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they struck New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The significant defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day could fall back on them in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But regardless of this, a 15-man team would have been defeated in the form of this form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It might be a consolation for GB - but it is probably not that at least a bridge will hang a gold medal around his neck. Fijis head coach Ben Ryan, the former head of England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path behind.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago she was lost at Ryan every game in the Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they lost only one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This piece is weaving, but the progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji had been wonderful and caused the GBS attacks from Spass.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt to the captain Tom Mitchell on and Co., when you run in driving buses. the World Series winner went 5-0 to top, when Osea Kolinisau went over the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With four minutes playing time, Jerry Tuwai added another attack out of the right corner which he walked.</seg>
<seg id="15">Finally the ball has the ball for 12-0 and GB.</seg>
<seg id="16">A heaviest Tackle of Mitchell stops the mountain of Mann-Leone Nakarawa a third goal, but the Fiji had not stopped.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute Jasa Veremalua arrived in the right corner a touch down and it stood 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new ever since its re-fiff and there was still over a minute playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou are predipped by further weak hopper of the GB teams and stormed up to line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to rest.</seg>
<seg id="21">It's like a Fiji had been born to play the 7, while the GB are still to be picked.</seg>
<seg id="22">So it is also.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB introduced basic changes to half-time and closed the fijiic gap... for all four minutes, which was good for the ratios of the first half-time until Joshua Tuisova ran after a brilliant diplay of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton launched an attempt to GB, made a touch down in the left corner for a 36-7 but the game ended long in favour of the southern sulphate, whose fans snakes, flags tilted and danced on the grandstand.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the recording of Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame set the i-bag with another attempt in the last seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The fiff erttoned, the fijis impoverished and the GB are struck down and struck down in the lawn.</seg>
<seg id="28">Earlier on the day Fiji had defeated Japan in semi-final with 20-5 defeated and the UK South Africa hit the difference in a knob match from the race - Great Britain's conversion.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown brought the Boats in the first half of the front, but Dan Norton broke out the line with an impressive footwork and achieved a fool under the post in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant late tackling of Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of English 15-Aside teams, assured the win - and thus the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by the fight with the cancer of the trainer for rowing victory</seg>
<seg id="2">There will be no biodeficiency gold as with these games and that will be hot.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first rowing until the last, 220 hard Hieve that enter in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional significance in their golden moment on Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even though there were only those who were sitting on the Ruins, there were three voices in the boat. the Echo of the trainer Robin Williams, was present always at the second Olympiad in a row, the first women in the history of British Sports, which gave such a scale.</seg>
<seg id="5">Your dominance was absolute, after all of all her 39.ter is unbearable.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we can see are two brilliant artists who lead over the surface with the elegance of sweeping things, which reflects not the kind of triumphs on geze.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind every gold in the rowing, a Bataillon will contribute to the distinction that make the difference, and there was no helpless than the trainer, who was not able to survive this day when he was diagnosed with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said he risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer, which is operable and they did.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not do that, he spreads out everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been pretty worse situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a little the view.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio had luck that he could be the treatment in early 2014, out of season, could start what the interruption to a minimum, in case the proper term is at all.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, therefore I needed to go better again soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was a incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in hospital and ran at the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough.</seg>
<seg id="18">So it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">The rowing to itself is a challenge, but that makes it a bigger one.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the Immediaview of the victory went their first thoughts on Williams, who had a nerve morning to speak a little more than otherwise and tried to process his own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">Stanning, which was the centurion at the Royal Artillery Regiment in an action in Afghanistan, "I was this week an emotional wreck. that's perhaps something extremely rare, but it means so much."</seg>
<seg id="22">It is only repeated that how much I and Helen and Helen have been working with Robin.</seg>
<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin, we are no one, therefore a massive thank you to him. he is the best coach of the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">I would like to wish I have a better person for trainer or better trainer.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning lost no race in the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The pair had a hard rhythm with which their opponent could not keep up.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even during the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to close, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">Helen called "lead in the process, lead in the process."</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important to catch oneself away.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we were not going to make something Tolles.</seg>
<seg id="33">We wanted no fireworks today, we wanted to achieve a good result, going out and win the race, which we did.</seg>
<seg id="34">The pair will take for one year before it will make decisions about his future.</seg>
<seg id="35">Glover must appear next week at a wedding, their own with the TV adventure Steve Backshall.</seg>
<seg id="36">Just want to enjoy the moment.</seg>
<seg id="37">I didn't want to say that my last race was.</seg>
<seg id="38">That would have too much pressure.</seg>
<seg id="39">In London it took about six months to realize that I am an Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="40">It was all so new to me and I was so stressed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Here it took about four minutes.</seg>

<seg id="6">A little later the water forum of the government of Lower Franconia followed the two-wing association.</seg>
<seg id="7">The work of the Veits group sailed in Bavarian as exemplary. "</seg>
<seg id="8">Behind all this Rupert Göller, who was 31 years in the two-association employee, 28 years ago as managing director.</seg>
<seg id="9">Now he was retired at the age of 65.</seg>
<seg id="10">The potable water-purpose organization with headquarters in Kottendorf, Municipality of Breitbrunn, promotes about 150000 cubic meters of water and supplies 32 places and hamlet with about 5500 inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="11">Affiliates are the churches of Kirchalle, Breitbrunn, a loud, Ebelsbach and the town of Baunach.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are water supply agreements for further cities and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="13">The current president, Breitbrund Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller was hired as a waterway back in 1985 and was named as Managing Director of the Association of Pursuck in 1988.</seg>
<seg id="14">"its tasks are very multifaceted, and has been extended from water management and maintenance of office and organizational activities, the budget, calculation of fees and contributions to emergency contracts at weekends," said the chairman.</seg>

<seg id="18">He has worked with lots of heart bloody for his water-purpose association and he lived in the water-purpose association, as if it had its own company.</seg>

<seg id="20">He has received very much recognition and praise.</seg>
<seg id="21">Rupert Göller sformer praised waterfalls Alfons Griebel, who had worked together with him for 28 years.</seg>
<seg id="22">He is the best water and he was a faithful kneaded.</seg>
<seg id="23">Together we were an unbeatable team.</seg>
<seg id="24">In the highlights from his point of view, he called the Brunnenbau and the Restructured Association of Purpose.</seg>
<seg id="25">But the most difficult challenge and the most difficult application, however, the burglary of the church was on a 3rd of January.</seg>
<seg id="26">Here we had to work at minus 17 degrees the whole night, so that the villages could be supplied with water.</seg>
<seg id="27">Also the supply of Neubrunn can only be kept only, because you filled the canister of Pettstadt with hoses.</seg>

<seg id="6">For singing is like from several perspectives a great hobby for seniors, says Erhard Hackers from the German senior League.</seg>
<seg id="7">The majority of the elderly people sing in the choir and equalize the joy of music, describes hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">Through regular interventions, senior social contacts can combine and maintain.</seg>
<seg id="9">For often, social and family structures often solve, one choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">This experience has also made Ursel Kipp in their chorus: "to meet and organize themselves, to learn and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of the compositions."</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing in the positive sense, hackler refers.</seg>
<seg id="12">Because the senior citizens exercise a deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who calls his lungs regularly calls for daily life in everyday life as quickly out of the purest.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even if it goes to get the sound of the voice at the age, Singen is an optimal hobby.</seg>

<seg id="16">In the older generations the shared siningen had a much higher importance, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and leisure, explains it.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz often observed that singing or hearing from songs with older people wakes many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.</seg>
<seg id="18">With lyrics and especially tunes themselves endemic to deteriorated people on a long time.</seg>
<seg id="19">In addition, at the head a special achievement is required, Lenz stated.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, at the same time, concentrate on their own voice and to fit the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Just elderly people who live alone and do not only focus on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition, that travels across the choir in the choir hackler.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">The self-esteem is also growing by singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">Themselves to show yourself: if I'm long for anything, I'll get better and watch over me - this experience strengthens.</seg>
<seg id="26">Good reasons to start with singing, there is enough enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">Whoever wants to try a new hobby, should not hesitate; even if he writes, little talent, avenged Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="28">You don't sing alone - at 50 singing people, who hears there though once a sound is going to go?</seg>
<seg id="29">In search of a suitable offer, seniors have various possibilities, says hackler.</seg>

<seg id="32">Who like to sing in an ecclesiastical choir may directly turn to the church or church presidents.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senior choirs can also be found via the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">If you have access to the Internet, the family, friends or neighbors could ask help with Internet access.</seg>

<seg id="2">Wherever you are too late, the Olympic Games are too late.</seg>

<seg id="5">You cannot place the TV, a newspaper or listen to the talk about your neighbors in the queue-shop without hearing at Simone Biles, Katie Lecovers, or the battle between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there are Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a female swarm of dimples, could quite be submitted to Prime Time, constructed by sponsors and well-being TV advertisements if he was a swimmers, Turner or even fond.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, Lake Forest, California, fighting for the olympic trampolines around gold.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate any event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the center, partly in the shade there are sports-types that are not universally recognized: airpistol shooting, archery, Badminton, Taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the chest swimming and let it rule for long.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I have a modest arguments for my particular darling, then let me go attention to the discrete charm of the tramp.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampolinip had been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut there in Sydney, the past 16 years so much that I asked, did not know that at all, there is a Olympiad portal.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the US athletes did to fight for competition, it has never won a medal in the trampolinip, and had an athlete until 2012, who made it until the end of the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians are decreed to divide the prizes for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their Gold Medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampolinip has a certain exterior charme, partly because it sounds for the unexplained ears for a clownsschool for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">I should admit that I'm not an expert, but I just am an experienced enthusiasts.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humoristical potential - Cartoonous citations of his never swollen slit - but also the Grazie of gyms and dive, which combines two sports, which is essentially uniting.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "the word" "" "trampoline" "" "comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means as much as" "" "Sprungboard" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Upstream skip on a gigantic trampoline, shoot nearly up to 30 feet into the air and have to land a number of falling movements (threshing, Hreal and Saltos) before falling down at the feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to the official Olympic network, you'll be judged by the execution of difficulty and "Flight."</seg>
<seg id="24">Two young athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will join in Rio each other.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic Vektor is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallions have to continue to gold in their way to gold, faster, back and over, sometimes up to the finish, sometimes up and back, down and down on the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">You will not only hunt the Zieginie or the starting wall, but also in the television broadcast: one of the world or the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="28">The goal is Nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it's enough to stir even a spectator.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it's also what I feel at watching this games as a little tired.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers an reprieve.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampolines is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the target.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or pruncle, seemingly heaviest as a astronaut, goes down to the top, then effortlessly back to the top.</seg>
<seg id="34">There is also a contest, of course not without difficulty, but during exercise there is no hectic attack on the destination, no wolves into the distance, only the dreaming, elegant revocation of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is that Zen can only be Zen in the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualifying and final round of women will be held on Friday afternoon, in the streaming around 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will radiate the final round as part of a supplement block on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the middle of the Olympia-Manie they talk to a quiet, nice moment, one who is likely to see in general tumult.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the increase of consciousness can only be reached by the Angers and the object of male athletes - how it proposed the male US Turner according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Dooley expects his ring to ring the new fan base.</seg>

<seg id="3">Demonstrators, call for political changes in Ethiopia, shooting a violent opposition to the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that they were killed protesters during condolences with police in Schussars.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just doing besides?</seg>
<seg id="6">In the past ten years, it was one of the most stable African countries, a solid alliance with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in recent months, protests against the government had destroyed the land and far more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week, thousands of people caught on the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The government's response was not merciful to human rights organizations.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses testified that policemen were shot and killed unarmed and killed.</seg>
<seg id="11">In circulation, videos on the protests, presumably taken from the last or beginning of this year, show how safe people strike young people with sticks, while they were forced to make a hand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Chief of the UN High Authority for Human Rights now demands a further investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "it was always difficult to keep this country and future will even be more difficult," "" "said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">After Nigeria, Ethiopia is the most populous country of Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence services collaborates closely with Ethiopia, in order to fight terror over the region, particularly in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if ever, get a lot of Western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy grew in considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">His infrastructure has been drastically improved - there is a new pivot train in the capital Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">The streets are generally quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Although Ethiopia had all other than a model for democracy - human rights organizations have continued to improve repression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted, whereby dissidents were brought into silence.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile or sent into prison, or cast into the Desert times of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "if you suppress people and these no other options have to protest, it breaks out," "" "said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Central Ethiopian." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The whole youth protested.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous symptoms that cover everything from land use until the litigation of the rule on power of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="26">Following a broadly critical election last year, the regent party and its allies received the final seat of the opposition and now control 100 per cent of the parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, the stresses rise along the border to Eritrea; a battle for these zacking, controversial line called for hundreds of life in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analyst fear that separatists such as the Oromo-Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of Ogaden, which have been enforced more or less, the turbulence arose and could be armed again.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of biting after years of age are now explode under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems to be harmless: Smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years very much Ethiopians were able to communicate through the social media, as cheaper smartphones have been more common and improved the Internet services.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government has access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do in regular intervals, especially with protests, so many people can still communicate via internet proxies that hide themselves where they hold itself.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopia gave it to protest to protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that it's more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicers in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are no natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">Since Ethiopia prospersed the Amharas, who are predominantly Christian high countries, in politics and business, while the Oromos exploited, of which many Muslims are living and in flat land areas live.</seg>
<seg id="37">But this is changing just too.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "we are in the way to coordinate with a screen," "" "Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The largest protests were held in the areas of Amhara and Barmos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Orochi have dominated the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, who account for about 6 percent of the population, who are dominant in the military services, trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for inrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">"" "" "" "Mr Meles, a former rebellion until his death came to a non-public illness in 2012 for 17 years of Ethiopia's Prime Minister." ""</seg>
<seg id="43">He was considered a tactical Genius, a man that could think about corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that it was especially licensed to use early signs of dissatisfaction and to use special agreements to edit the opponent and to make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the current regime is lacking in this basic skill," "" "Mr. Abdi, a conflict analyst" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen out of relatively unknown reasons to take the position of Mr Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike the Lord Meles, who came out of the tiger of the north of Ethiopian, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that it does not enjoy the confidence of the security services by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fears that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time that Ethiopia had experienced such an uproar in 2005, after thousands of the elections were protested by the government, and then stolen from the government.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the following raids were killed many protesters, even if it were less than in the past months and that time of disturbances were relatively quickly past.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development replied Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure plans, such as new Pendars, as well as for its measurable progress in poverty.</seg>
<seg id="53">But apparently this did not prevent the intensification of the anti-Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">The last month, protesters in Gondar, an ambolic city, by Tigray, shops and hatred against the tigray is always exercisable in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests had the USA and other Western allies in a separate position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as the basis for Dronenflights on the neighboring Somalia, even if she recently announced that it closed this base.</seg>
<seg id="58">"" "" "" "during the West, he clearly wants to support democracy, he will not say that his ban collapsed in an already volatile area." ""</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland: the oldest tebroth is nearly 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">More rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland haie usually occur in the winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return to the sea on board the research ship Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was born in 1624 and floating with a top speed of 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland haves got up to 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">In an hour, on average, in an hour, on average it reaches 1,220 metres in the Greenland's North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only if it goes on, the five-metre long animal accelerates to a whopping 2.6 km / h - and this top speed is half as fast as a Robbe.</seg>
<seg id="9">This of longitude shaped lifestyle seems to be a sponsorship for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues have reported in the journal Science "in any case from Greenland, who could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "madness," "" "commented Alexander Schedlein from the Max Planck Institute for demographic Research in Rostock, which means a world record for vertebrates." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Indeed, the evolutionary biologist assumed a long time in Greenland.</seg>
<seg id="13">Just missing the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland haie are difficult to observe, finally they live mainly in the ice sea before the thinly populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer to water temperatures around 6 degrees Celsius, they appear mostly in the winter only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">To know about the lifestyle of Greenland, researchers have little.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their timespentagrams they were, as they presented six animals with a broadcaster.</seg>
<seg id="18">Spoil this shark: in the stomach of a beast, researchers found the remains of a Robbe, another had swallowed the pine bones of a young icbären.</seg>
<seg id="19">May you may chase them sleeping animals or patrol on the reason of the ice sea and are Kadaver, who torates from higher levels of water according to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues were now surveyed 28 Greenland, the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Spitsbergen from the depth of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 cm long while the biggest 502 centimetres dimension.</seg>
<seg id="22">To determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the core of the sharks with its carbon-14 method.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye lens is already born before the birth of the sharks, which contained therein will no longer be renewed.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had a lot of carbon-14 in the lens core.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s, as a nuclear test-try major amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the length of 220 centimeters in length, the lender's length on carbon-14, however, contained a low surplus of carbon-14 in its nuclear weapon, so it is likely to celebrate its 50th birthday in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">All bigger Greenland haemy had its carbon-14 quantities in its lens, which occurs by cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14 is demonstrated for a 493 centimeters long Greenland-shark, at the age of 335, while the record shark could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Greenland-females just got up again, when they are longer than four metres, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now, the researchers of the length were assigned to age.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimeters will probably be on the threshold of the sexually mature and its age with 156 years has been determined, Greenland's shark residue to at least one and a half centuries.</seg>
<seg id="32">That is likely to be the world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusalise live mainly in icy waters, is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">Also the old record holder, a 211 years old Greenland, whose spouse was on neck a 120-year old harp pointed, was caught before Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to its low temperatures, the organism of the living-living creatures frequently runs on Sparflames.</seg>
<seg id="36">So you realize later - and alder slowest.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in cold water, the animals are often extremely large.</seg>
<seg id="38">For the volume grows much faster than its surface, due to the animal heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of a gram of mouse is therefore much larger than with a gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have less enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "a smaller animal is so dangerous and should focus on it as early as possible as many generations," "" "explains the evolutionary approach." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">A very big animal should rather invest his resources in a long life.</seg>

<seg id="5">And that will be reached by making new possibilities for local residents and companies near Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="6">For our local communities we will already make 10,000 new apprentices, 40,000 new jobs, and the youth unemployment in the airport environment will prepare an end.</seg>
<seg id="7">As they were ahead in London 2012, there will be such that the challenge of the extension of Heathrow is too big.</seg>
<seg id="8">I told me that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be able to blame for the world stage.</seg>
<seg id="9">The two fles were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong with Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="10">There are always obstacles to oversight, but Heathrow answered every answer every question.</seg>
<seg id="11">How the Olympic Games is Heathrow for many and not a infrastructure project.</seg>
<seg id="12">Extension is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion at funny growth and a legacy of skills and employment in order to leave the airport as well as in whole GB.</seg>
<seg id="13">We have a great team in Heathrow, which has implemented a £11 bn savings program in time and budget, from T5 - the five years in a row to the world's best airport terminal, up to T2, which was built in the midst of the two frequencies of the world.</seg>
<seg id="14">Now they are ready to deliver a third catwalk, which is supported by £16 billion to private investment.</seg>
<seg id="15">London's London Olympic Games were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow is also to be one.</seg>

<seg id="1">Datenklau: so perfide-press hacker you ransom their ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmer from press malware attack currently targeted companies - and are successfully successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey of the malware infection specialist Malopebooks under 540 companies in North America, UK and Germany were 40 percent of surveyed companies in the past twelve months at least once, partial victims of a attack with pressurfers.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany, almost 20 percent of companies had already achieved a target of a Ransomware battery.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 per cent of the victims of the victims, demanded by the perpetrators which could use the challenged systems and data to be able to use the challenged systems.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators specialize their pressive software according to the observations of Malwarfs based on attacks in the company network.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potential free ransom benefit is significantly higher than with private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "we observe a quick evolution of pollutants software," "" "malwarrior-boss Marcin Kleczyński in conversation with the" "" "World" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008 most malwareprograms have been designed to send advertisements.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then discovered the perpetrator software for itself.</seg>
<seg id="11">Only Privatuser were the target, but the change went out to the company in the past months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works after a simple pattern: once active on the computer of an victim, she searches after uninterrupted files such as WordPress, Excel- or database files, as well as archives of pictures and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encodes the Ransomware and deletes the originals sustainable.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then the software presents the requirements of pressurfers.</seg>
<seg id="15">To get the final key code to the files, the victims must have money - mostly in the form of the cryption Bitcoin -.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where private use the personal photo database on the game, it goes to companies with sensitive customer data or project databases without which the production is shut down.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly, the damage falls off if a ransomware suggests.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of the affected German companies reported waste losses due to Ransomware, 13 percent had to be even worse, in one case, people were living in life.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany there were already several hospitals in attacks of attacks, whose patients may be threatened by loss of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "we are always say:" "" "pays off, you only promotes the problem," "" "explains Kleczyński." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But 80 to 90 percent of firms, paying, will receive their data again.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers, it is difficult to refuse to reject the requirement of the offenders in the operation.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hacker again wants to know and try to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, the security forgers of F-Secure examines the usage surfaces and the contact with the pressurfers and come to the result: the perpetrators are actually trying to set up a kind of customer service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">You explain their victims per chat on how they can pay by bitcoin, freely available support websites one or decrypt free example files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And they will be redeemed for payments of a few hundred euros, company will have to pay attention in hard and five-digit sums to decrypt their data.</seg>
<seg id="27">Given the potential high and relatively risk profit from the Ransomware deficiency, the hacker will always share professional and share their work, explains the Security provider SOPHOS: "a single person can write a Ransomware about within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">It is more likely to be about three or four people.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmer sell their damage software then in the form of a software modular to the actual compression.</seg>
<seg id="30">The previous malware kits produced by malware themselves, advice and additional tools for a single, fixed price between 1000 and 10.000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "delivery includes a customization, so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," "" "Wisniewski says." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">The presser will then look further chipper for spreading the newly introduced software under the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service industry.</seg>
<seg id="34">So, in one of the forums, one buys the set of a crime and commissioned a further to install the software on as many PCs.</seg>
<seg id="35">The payment is done by using calculator.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "" "" "lastly, the criminals then spammer is" "" "explains Wisniewski" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is known to many companies that get their data better.</seg>
<seg id="38">More than 50 percent of companies-related companies in the Malwarovski survey have confidence to revoke Ransomware by file-back-ups and scanners.</seg>
<seg id="39">The perpetrators are pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"if the encryption of data alone is no adequate threat to successful vomiting, the perpetrators instead with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or price-calculations," explains Malgebooks-CEO Marcin Kleczynski.</seg>
<seg id="41">According to the type of data, the potential of damage, according to the type of data, is more multiple than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">In the future, the perpetrators could also take completely new targets on the Internet of Things (s).</seg>
<seg id="43">On the hackerconference Defcon demonstrated safety researchers, as they were able to obtain thermostat under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of the winter, the activation of a derart blocks could be quite a ransom benefit.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrator then instead of heating in the future a whole production line in a factory could block Ransomware also in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleep disturbances?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disturbances, and there are many different causes underlying, emphasises Hans-Günter Weeß, member of the German Society for Animals and Sleep Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">What you understand, however, is the insomnie, so an inlet and asleep.</seg>
<seg id="8">Just the diasleep feel many people as unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the German domestic medical association with practice in the Lower Saxony Varel.</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind Sleeping disorders?</seg>

<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">As of when should you sleep with sleep to a doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">Those who do not sleep for a period of one month in at least three nights per week, should be impaired, should go to the doctor, wedge Weeß.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment can look quite different: one is beaten, tired, unlocked, has difficulties with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has tuning fluctuations or physical complaints like stomach or headaches.</seg>
<seg id="20">In order to alleviate the sleep disorder, it is important to find out their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">As treatment options, behavioral behavior, a cognitive behavioral therapy, or other medicines - classic sleep tablets only in exceptional cases and no more for two weeks.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "deep sleep" "" "in Germany there is hard to emphasises Prof. Ingo Fixed, leader of the interdisciplinary medical center of the Charité University Medicine Berlin." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">Therefore you should first contact with sleeping difficulties at first at home, avenging weeß.</seg>
<seg id="24">It can clarify with investigations whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should come into sleep laboratory, and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">For examination in sleep labs, medicine for instance with respiratory failure, for sleeping tiredness, with sleeping tiredness or if one does not find the cause of a diasleep, explains Fibre.</seg>
<seg id="27">We do not need to prepare for the study.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only please do no lunch," says Fibre.</seg>
<seg id="30">After the clabling you enter into the bed at its normal time.</seg>

<seg id="15">It doesn't sound like a Kiez, who wanted to unwanted poliomyelitis in front of vandalism on the left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The trench, which the Berliner Innensenator and the police between houses and their neighbours, obviously not exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working area, which is also today in comparison to the rest of the city, an average salary and a high risk of poverty.</seg>
<seg id="18">Also houses and other newborn residues are already a long time to the Kiev: in 1990, numerous houses were occupied by the former GDR, including almost the entire Mainzer street near the Rigaer.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the mazer had been cleared among a large police battle, many of the projects were legalised in the Rigid and are still inhabited by people today, who had occupied them 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the district has become increasingly on the magnets for tourists and elecriliner from around the world: with them the inhabitants of GDR times and former house he became their Kiev.</seg>
<seg id="21">This also makes for rent a remarkable, which has risen by nearly 60 percent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the newbuildings in the Rigid will be attacked as symbols for this development: they recognize them into checked slices or freshly coated facades, which were subjected to colours.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other street has been mentioned so often together with the words "linksautonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">A reason for that not all neighbors could see the problem that they are not necessarily affected by the crime: offences such as body violate statistics, statistics are almost exclusively against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">The largest part of the offenders make atomic damage, the tends rather the newly built and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, which has been living in a rental house next to the controversial 94 years, no speech can be given by uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "what acts of violence is weightful," "" "the people in the 94 are their neighbors who have not been intended." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Also the famous burning cars will give it right in the Rigid already longer.</seg>
<seg id="29">For those studied architect, her street is no criminal focus, on the contrary: "here one helps each other, lives together on the street and gets more apart, then somewhere else."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer is consciously drawn into the Rigid street - and stayed.</seg>
<seg id="31">Therefore it was so important that the residents receive their road: from the police, politics and the media, all suddenly stressed the Deutory on the district in July.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of inhabitants like Neugebauer, the road will continue to be taken away: by splutter new buildings in former building gaps, that overtook the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "we are the last condominiums, which are not interesting for many, - here are people who are not so well as" "" "says it." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"violence and destruction I cannot be guarded."</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should one do when someone listening to someone?</seg>
<seg id="36">Since then, there is a stration on all sides of frustration, even with the police and the inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="37">For Zuczoic, who have more than colour bombs, Kerstin Neugebauer has somewhat understanding: the skin projects and the left scene belonged to the Kiev.</seg>
<seg id="38">Whoever draws up should be aware of itself - exactly like someone who moves into a bar area that can be badly lamented over noise.</seg>
<seg id="39">All only with pre-names presented persons have asked to be called not with their right name</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuschle is new refugees</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact partner in the fields of integration and organizer.</seg>
<seg id="3">In addition she is a social worker.</seg>
<seg id="4">Since July Annika Deuschle has been the refugee commissioned for Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social educators support team in the administration of Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">You see as contact partner for all actors: refugees, workers, refugee aid, administration, authorities and who else is mismixed.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine customer of the working group indicates that the volunteer are thankful that Deuterle is now dazzling pleasures, that has a problem particularly.</seg>
<seg id="8">For example, some - less spit rather than rather to the multitude of wishing responsibilities, meant to be expressed as managing the site wanted to write.</seg>
<seg id="9">Sought an administrative force with a talent for languages and people, joined with a long-term experience in the field of social work, just a jealous Wollumsau.</seg>
<seg id="10">Yet administrative work is not her central area, Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, go to organisation, work with people on site and also behind the scenes and network activity.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been present for around six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">She gave a 50 percent stake to three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was high time" says Regine customer, says Annika Deuschle Honor and hauptian actors supported.</seg>
<seg id="15">There are large and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon new container in the Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">A heavy problem exists since some time to find flats for the connecting-fleets that have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">The communes are competent for the connection of the connection.</seg>
<seg id="19">They must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented flats.</seg>
<seg id="20">The cost of construction, rent or renovation of these accommodation you need to bear the communes itself.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility is moving from the Council of municipality to the commune and the job center.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not any owner wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">For some time, the search has been very difficult since some time.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto finds the administration not private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">So far, it did not work so that you should be instructed in private apartments so Deuterle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, these apartments have to be notorious, as it is called so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers are placed in the Wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a permanent residence, there are trainees, training places, training places, one-euro jobs and aid activities to refugees and migrants.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good" reports Regine customer.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many works in the building yard or help home star, do-profit work - and the motivated and very tidy, as Annika Deuschle reported.</seg>
<seg id="33">It hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">This is "no employment therapy".</seg>
<seg id="35">Work is not only work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day need a fixed structure, say Deuterle and client.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a feasible experience.</seg>
<seg id="38">So it offers offers such as sport, contacts with locals and especially language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rar.</seg>
<seg id="40">You can also jump here administration and community community.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is centrally that refugees get the feeling in Germany and wish to be welcomed in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">Long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">You need to explain the refugees that it takes it to time, for example using language courses, for example.</seg>
<seg id="44">Whoever does not feel like that, he could not work in Urbach, do not work, and be unprofitable, who will never integrate it.</seg>
<seg id="45">The distinct majority are motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">Problem claims, however, is the honest, "people, in which nothing goes." the work of Deuschle and client is therefore always motivating others to motivate others.</seg>
<seg id="47">All these have been a "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: did the two after the youngest incidents in front of radicalization, also in a small community like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "no," "" "says the customer clearly," "" "what lack of naif can name" "". "a residual risk could be, but would not make them unlock." ""</seg>
<seg id="50">Sensibilites are the helper now.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents were also the topic in refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They had the fear that the assassination attempt in call it completely.</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "you want to show that they don't have anything to do anything," "" "says the customer." ""</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So the main and honourful place must be held on site and in the region of activities.</seg>
<seg id="56">They always have in the background, that soon a new stores could come to refugees and migrants to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">This question clearly aims to answer the policy.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually, it is unfair to put away helpers on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we haven't arrived there where we would like," says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would be able to relax.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer also makes it clear that the Urbacher has also been used to integrate the previous people working properly.</seg>
<seg id="63">This is currently around 100 people, mainly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But if people are in need, the women are able to help themselves.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there are no easy answers.</seg>
