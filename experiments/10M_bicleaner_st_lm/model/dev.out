Obama received Net@@ any@@ ahu
the ratio between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just friendly .
the two wanted to speak on the implementation of the international agreement as well as Teh@@ er@@ ans dest@@ abil@@ ising in the Middle East .
it is aimed at an encounter with the Palestinians , which discussed the conflict with the Palestinians and the discussed two @-@ states solution .
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been e@@ ager since years .
Washington critic@@ ises the continuing urban development of Israel and raises Net@@ any@@ ahu peace@@ able consent to the peace process .
in 2004 , by Barack Obama saved the Iranian nuclear programme , the two continued to deteri@@ or@@ ate themselves .
in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu had kept at the invitation of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in front of the US Congress a controversi@@ al speech which was partly inv@@ oked by Obama .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the speech no not talked about Obama , had a meeting at the upcoming elections in Israel with regard to the parties . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a call he goes on to shoot his gir@@ l@@ friend
in a emergency call , Professor Sh@@ annon Lamb said with a somewhat ab@@ st@@ worthy voice of the police , that he shot his gir@@ l@@ friend and the civil servants would have to come to his home .
Lamb has been important to emphas@@ ize that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was still alive and probably imag@@ in@@ atively , and he said that the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone .
within the house , the officers of Amy Pr@@ ent@@ iss and a handwritten note , which looked at a white souven@@ ir sheet : &quot; I felt so sorry , I loved it , but I loved it , &quot; this was signed by the authorities in the letter , and he was later signed by Lamb .
there was no hint concerning the Lamb who went into two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland , Mississippi , carried out even 300 miles to the school area , where he was killed and killed by a popular course professor , E@@ than Schmidt thus , at the door to his office .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Delta State University of the police &quot; Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford says the University staff who have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that Lamb has put out the fat@@ eful emergency day sometime after it .
until the end of the day , there was another death : the lamb rec@@ alled him when the police was bound .
one day after the shooting in the university , the students and instru@@ c@@ tors made it to hide themselves behind the closed doors , the authorities are still trying to create a picture of what has been motiv@@ ated .
the details issued by the investig@@ ators at the two ends of the state , as well as something , students and employees who didn &apos;t know , helped to draw a picture from a talented but possibly difficult teacher .
students said they were looking forward to his lessons .
the police in G@@ auti@@ cs , where Pr@@ un@@ ite died , said he had no history of violence or a criminal atri@@ al history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; God himself had not mentioned herein in a book written by him in which he mentioned &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wonderful people &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with whom he divided his academic life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both were in the department for social science and history , whose whole body includes 17 members , and many students visited courses of both .
at the same time , there were some tend@@ encies to problem@@ atic behavi@@ ours .
a student , Bran@@ don Be@@ gone , who praised God , said he also appeared a little child and wor@@ ried , &quot; as if anything was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes said that Lamb didn &apos;t tell him that he had done with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
Lamb didn &apos;t record the Delta State University to record good health grounds and said that he had any health problem .
in this year he taught only two online courses .
most recent changes in the employment policy of the university imp@@ eded that the Promotion was working for the Lamb so hard , for him no guarantee for an automatic way to an appointment as Assistant Professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Univers@@ ily president William La@@ For@@ ge said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he knew nothing from a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there has been something to Mr Lam@@ bs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions that can not answer anymore .
after the run from the Campus police operated later Lam@@ bs up the police when he moved back into Mississippi , Ar@@ kan@@ sas .
before he could get arrested , Lamb attempts them with a .@@ 38 pot@@ assi@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about one mile south of his parents &quot; on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississippi , told Washington County Cor@@ on@@ l Johnson .
his car ran into the dri@@ v@@ eway .
it was not immediately clear why they went to this house but Johnson said that they knew that he knew the people who lived there .
Lamb kept out in the area .
Lamb began work out in 2009 to work on the university , the 3,@@ 500 students in a town of about 12,000 inhabitants and taught ge@@ ography and education .
he obtained his PhD in the spring of education .
one of the long@@ time friends of Lem@@ bs described it as intelligent , char@@ ism@@ atic and fun .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said , she was 15 and he was 20 when they met their friends .
they and their friends were in high school , and he was the cool legacy of the guy who tried to teach a guitar game for several years .
in the time he was black and white .
all girls are mol@@ ten where it was , &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in Jackson cave city of Bran@@ don .
Lamb and Pr@@ un@@ ite were obviously certain some time .
in the not@@ ation Lamb said &quot; I have killed my wife , &quot; but there was no sign of marriage .
they had a dog called Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick @-@ house who just fled to a Ba@@ you in G@@ auti@@ er .
the police told that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ un@@ ite , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said that she had been divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who now had 19 years old .
&quot; she was totally destroyed in the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter .
and her mother were absolutely greatest friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he has never met Me , but I heard it with his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail , who has prevailed in music out of music and blu@@ es .
Lamb didn &apos;t come out later when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail appeared in the years ago both in the summer of the year .
later they played together one or other gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , his daughter writes and sings his own music .
Pr@@ un@@ ite was a nurse who worked for various companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a b@@ art@@ ender , and sometimes entert@@ aining events at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a faint lighted bar on the night of September 5 for the last time , for Lamb didn &apos;t finish his guitar and harmon@@ ic aspect before a fur@@ ious audience .
there was no signs that anything is not agreed .
&quot; simply just a happy pair , &quot; he said .
we were there in evacu@@ ation and jo@@ ys .
I mean , they both had a good sense for sh@@ ear .
Schmidt , the t@@ ote teacher , led the first semester programme and speci@@ alis@@ es in American ac@@ coun@@ ties and colonial history , said Don Allan &apos;s , a English @-@ professor at school .
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Emp@@ oria State University in Kansas , where was President of the Brotherhood and students of the university .
around 900 people in the Delta State Campus in Cleveland began on Tuesday evening about 900 people , including lec@@ tur@@ ers , employees , students and members of the congregation at a cand@@ l@@ el@@ ight commemorative ceremony .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sch@@ mid@@ to wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt was also attending the memorial station , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; Amaz@@ ing Grace &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
teaching will be resumed on Wednesday .
&quot; we are trying to move our students to return , &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge .
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
Amy and Rog@@ el@@ io Soli@@ s reported from Cleveland , Mississippi .
Associated Press &amp; Emil@@ y Wagner , P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Mississippi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected to contra@@ di@@ ct that the police refused to shoot the emergency when he had killed him , and that Lamb didn &apos;t receive his wife , but there is no hint on it that the two they have got married .

the back of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we were in the theater still waiting at the Roy@@ als , and I perc@@ eive that the seat is too close to me and it will be very clear that Princess Diana is sitting next to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said in a trailer for a coming documentary &quot; Back in Time &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the UN CEO says , There is no military solution in Syria
Secretary @-@ General Ban Ki @-@ moon states his response to Russia &apos;s reinforced military support for Syria : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of nearly five years &quot; conflict , and more weapons will be prevented by violence and mis@@ ery of millions of people .
the UN Chief of the UN again calls for all parties , including the given UN Security Council , to recogn@@ ise themselves and have an inclusive negotiations for finding a political solution .
ban told a press conference on Wednesday that he decides to discuss the foreign minister of the five permanent member states of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the fr@@ inge of the meeting of the General Meeting of the AGM in this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he regre@@ t@@ ted that the insur@@ it@@ ees should make the Council and within the Syrian People and Regional Attractions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to make this situation in@@ sol@@ uble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ban adopted the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity crisis in Syria , which demonstrated at the launch of a nuclear strike deal with Iran .
8 fra@@ gment values that are show that Donald Tr@@ ump is not able to catch .
some have tried to stamp him as flop .
others have taken him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
however , no matter how some Republi@@ can try to run Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper p@@ ushing upon in@@ quiries down@@ wards , it doesn &apos;t work .
ten of the last eleven national surveys are led by Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit area , and some begin to wonder what it means for the opportunities of nom@@ ination of the real estate business .
of course , it is too early in the elec@@ toral period .
none claims that Tr@@ ump probably will win the republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts pre@@ supp@@ ose that in this time Rick Per@@ r@@ ys became an guidance on the rising of Herman Cain , of which no one was only allowed to be a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have strug@@ gled in a general election .
but outer side groups such as Je@@ b Bus hs @-@ Super P@@ AC and the conservative Economic Area Club for Growth now recognize cl@@ umps di@@ ets and start to flow away their dollar , to overthrow him .
here are some current traffic values that indicate that the real estate @-@ Mog@@ ul are not only a temporary phase :
sm@@ umps Ac@@ tu@@ ative values have turned around 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump sent his candidate in mid @-@ June , a survey of Mon@@ mouth University announced that only two of ten re@@ public@@ ans see the real estate business .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August , it was 52 percent .
now six of 10 re@@ public@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
they have a negative opinion about three out of ten .
these figures are in the early states .
a Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac &apos;s vote in I@@ owa has found that 60 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two thirds of GO@@ P voters will be happy with tr@@ ump to candidates .
in a CNN pol@@ l of CNN / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , they would be either &quot; excited &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; when Tr@@ ump was nominated .
only two of ten say , they are &quot; sc@@ and@@ ing , &quot; if he was the candidate .
only Ben Car@@ son creates the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent said they would be &quot; excited &quot; vs. 40 percent , which will say the same about vol@@ ump ) .
the nearest in enthusiasm ?
Marco Rub@@ io is only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of the republi@@ can voters say that Je@@ b Bush , the One of the E@@ stabl@@ ishment , was the candidate .
a majority of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans can &apos;t see f@@ aux temper@@ ament as problem .
during Donald Tr@@ ump , 52 per cent of the attacks against the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , 52 per cent of the lic@@ ali@@ ans of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans that the real estate @-@ Mog@@ ul is the right temper@@ ament for president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is in the first pre@@ stige state of the nation , the State of I@@ owa , where the same 52 per cent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans think he gave the personality for a Commander in Chief , according to Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
however , 44 percent nevertheless believe that he did not perform the personality to effectively carry out effectively and nearly six of 10 independent membran@@ es say that his temper@@ ament is not into the White House P@@ asse , so ABC / Post .
Republi@@ can elec@@ torate ut@@ ap@@ ing itself to the idea .
if you expos@@ e their money , Republi@@ can elec@@ tor may receive Tr@@ ump for real .
if they are question@@ ed who wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination will say in a pol@@ l of CNN / OR@@ C past week four of ten that Tr@@ ump is taking the best bet .
it is a changeover from the date when four out of ten end of July their money on Je@@ b Bush .
complete dis@@ closure : GO@@ P @-@ voters in the past was not the most clear cryst@@ alline .
at that time in the final cycle , four out of ten re@@ public@@ ans that Rick Perry win the nom@@ ination would win only 28 % of the final candidates Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , a multitude of GO@@ P @-@ voters will add cro@@ c campaign as pl@@ au@@ si@@ ble .
even when the Repub@@ lic@@ ans took up a different candidate , Tr@@ ump is still not killed .
some experts refer to the frag@@ ile field likely to join too rough guide , while the Anti @-@ Tr@@ ump Support will be spread to more than a dozen other candidates .
but a survey of the Mon@@ mouth University at the beginning of September shows that hypo@@ thet@@ ical head @-@ on @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump .
he wrote 13 points ahead of Car@@ ly Fi@@ or@@ ina , before him Walker 15 points ahead of him Walker 15 points ahead of Je@@ z@@ Bush 19 points and finally before edge Paul , John Kas@@ im and Chris Christ@@ ie 33 points .
she is a head @-@ an @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who suggests him ?
Ben Car@@ son would guess the business@@ man with 19 points in a hypo@@ thet@@ ical head @-@ on @-@ head race .
a bun@@ ni@@ ece of Donald Tr@@ ump fans states that they have formed their mind .
a new survey of C@@ BS / NY@@ T shows that only little more than half of the voters being supported by the female , say that they vote for their vote .
of course , things can be done to change that , and nobody can really say , never understand the opinion .
46 percent said they openly let the door open to change other candidates .
nonetheless , Tr@@ umps is the most powerful competition at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders who have Neuro@@ sur@@ geon Ben Car@@ son , but voters say that they have formed their opinion , are double the most common to tr@@ ump .
six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans saying that they vote with Tr@@ ump on immigration .
since , Donald Tr@@ ump had been &quot; rape &quot; rape in his campaign prior to two months prior to 1979 , was the immigration to the public and public dis@@ course of the public dis@@ course .
some are concerned that the turn@@ around re@@ treat of Tr@@ ump decisive H@@ isp@@ ano @-@ Americans are fully remote from the Republi@@ can party and are not damage to these re@@ orient@@ ated efforts .
however , according to the new ABC / Post @-@ Survey of Monday , six of 10 re@@ public@@ ans so they were to vote with tr@@ ump in case of migration .
so long as the in@@ filtration remains in the spot@@ light , Donald Tr@@ ump will also do too .
the local fru@@ str@@ ation over the government climb@@ s to a new high@@ s .
on Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son there is now half the support of Republi@@ can elec@@ voters , especially by their out@@ si@@ ders .
six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say in the new Monday survey of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ si@@ ders as someone with government experience .
and they too is ra@@ ged in Washington .
a survey by Des Mo@@ ines regist@@ ers / Bloom@@ berg shows that three out of four I@@ owa Repub@@ lic@@ ans were fru@@ str@@ ated by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress with 54 percent , &quot; in@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 per cent . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas of Germany
here in the Hob@@ bit path is the most expensive residential community - with view over the northern leaf .
the street costs a square meter of a roof@@ ed hospital , average 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Sy@@ lt the offer is limited to objects in the study , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in the study - because the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows how special layers costs a square meter most .
of course , 18,@@ 70 Euro per square meter for a student body in Munich are not really little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top @-@ resident destinations , the price is one of the pe@@ an@@ uts .
the real estate vend@@ ors Angel@@ s &amp; Fo@@ kers published a leaderboard of most exclusive German native locations - with square footage in tiny ger@@ no@@ ises .

Champions League : Bayern @-@ dream start thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
the two jumps in Pi@@ ra@@ eus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just a run .
the FC Bayern paved the way for a comp@@ acted 3 : 0 near Olympi@@ ak@@ os Pi@@ ra@@ eus , and ran it to the FC Bayern .
a so@@ vereign case to the Champions League @-@ season .
the world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze have a dream start in the &quot; Mission Milan &quot; in the hands of FC Bayern .
the Team of Trainer P@@ EP Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won her kick @-@ off in the Champions League at the Greek record player Olympi@@ ak@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to the tr@@ ash@@ ist double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ .@@ + 2 ) and at@@ tract it . ( 9,@@ 9 ) earns with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth @-@ start @-@ in series should be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola returns to Munich the start @-@ potential .
in his 28th February Müller was awarded the Champions League to Bavaria @-@ guided road from Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart , which will happen to be a thought out by the World Champion .
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate that &quot; Bavaria @-@ Captain Philipp Lah@@ m had promised the game in the Kar@@ ais@@ ch@@ ak@@ is stadium in front of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 West blo@@ om fans - and the Munich @-@ based sector .
they presented a concentrated and eng@@ ed presentation , without sh@@ one .
pir@@ ate has won his most recent six home games in the Royal class , among them among emin@@ ent clubs as Manchester United , Atl@@ é@@ ti@@ co Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 , Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) died here .
but Bavaria , in seven Europ@@ ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams were un@@ overcome , but would not have the next victim .
it was cour@@ ageous to talk about their event@@ ual effort but often .
the attacks were often led to the left side at Lin@@ ks@@ out@@ Douglas Costa , who , with the earlier Braun@@ schwei@@ ger Omar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i were rarely en@@ forced .
Müller had left more fortun@@ ate when his face fallen from the right half of the back@@ ward in the left upper left of the To@@ re@@ ck .
in the 6@@ 7th minute , the world champion made the possible 2 : 0 .
the best opportunities in half part had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
first , as Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Stür@@ mer Brown struck the head ball of Poland on the line ( 26 ) .
then by direct , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto with the knees ( 3@@ 5. ) .
although the Bavaria continued to domin@@ ate the house he could set Pi@@ ra@@ eus hom@@ el@@ at .
at Tor@@ ne@@ ter Manuel New it &apos;s a non@@ stop .
thus , about having a shot of ide@@ ye about the Lat@@ te ste@@ ered ( 5@@ 6th ) .
New Gu@@ ardi@@ ola left a square sc@@ ab with David Al@@ aba in the center , next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , who did it well .
Mario Göt@@ ze , back to mus@@ cular problems back in the box , sitting outside at the outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup @-@ Hero was given the green light only after the final training , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sport@@ ly said to &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wants to make something different from it , that is very rare . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also during the first change , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided to win him when he King@@ sley Com@@ on for the registered Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 59@@ . ) .
Göt@@ ze was born late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( 7@@ 6. ) and made it clear 13 minutes later , by the El@@ f@@ meter .
in front of the game , it was in the stadium to motorcycles .
after a smaller group of partly su@@ re@@ painted Bavaria @-@ fans in its spect@@ ator block , the supp@@ orters of host Pir@@ ates drove with words and gest@@ ure prov@@ okes the security forces attacked and went with stroke against the Munich pendant .
at least a Bayern @-@ fan was hosp@@ ital@@ ized from the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , there &apos;s higher risk to lose teeth
those who smo@@ kes are not only the l@@ ungs , but also the teeth , a Potsdam &apos;s long @-@ term study is located .
good news : for aband@@ on@@ ment the risk falls rapidly .
smo@@ kers have a much higher risk to lose their teeth .
this is from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several members of the German Institute for Food Research ( DI@@ RE@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smoking people , smo@@ kers had the risk to lose their teeth comple@@ ately , in order to increase the 2.5 to 3.6 fifth phot@@ ovolt@@ aics .
the scientists had observed more than 23.@@ 300 participants .
the main causes of dental loss , car@@ ies and inflamm@@ ations of the g@@ um , is emphas@@ ised by DI@@ BA@@ E .
for this perio@@ don@@ tit@@ is it is smoking a risk factor , emphas@@ ize the authors .
the connections between smoking and loss of teeth will therefore return to frequent fl@@ esh@@ ten@@ ants during smo@@ kers .
not to be clari@@ fied , how severely smoking the risk for car@@ ies is increased .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people who heard smoking with smoking could reduce their risk within a short time , write the researchers at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it could take over ten years , until the haz@@ ard was sin@@ king to the level of non @-@ smoking issues , First aut@@ or Thomas Dietrich of the English University of Birmingham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; let people see that they will be non @-@ smo@@ ker , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Director of H@@ einer Boeing , from DI@@ RE@@ E &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been short@@ ening the lifetime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not to smoke is good for l@@ ungs and containers and leads to the knowledge of good dental health to the high age .
in Germany over 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years have been affected by rest@@ less@@ ness , this was done by DI@@ BA@@ E .
earlier , primary investigations had been noted that smoking is the risk of the loss of dental loss .
the new long @-@ term study support the findings .
archae@@ ologists in the Rhein@@ u@@ fer on rem@@ n@@ ants of the late anti@@ qu@@ ity
the findings were made public in Rhein@@ u@@ fer in Cologne e@@ ast@@ ward for the repeated time .
the archaeological area of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic museum sk@@ el@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings were du@@ g near to the construction site for the new Rhein@@ bou@@ lev@@ ard , museum director Marcus Trier about Tuesday .
since the start of construction work on the Rhine , hist@@ ori@@ ans are in search of so @-@ called bo@@ di@@ lap@@ tops .
in all building projects in the City District Cologne , the Museum always moved to the Archae@@ ological Bo@@ d@@ end@@ ental Care Museum .
in the third phase of the Rhine bou@@ lev@@ ards the archae@@ ologists were found a fifth site .
this text had been known from text docum@@ ent@@ aries , that in the 4th century , a fortress and in the 8th century was founded , explained and explained .
in addition to rem@@ n@@ ants of the fortress and the church , a cemetery was discovered approximately 350 graves , one of whom belonged to the church .

EU Commission proposes a new judgment in dispute over TT@@ IP
the EU Commission proposed a comprehensive reform of the current AC system to reduce the Trans@@ atl@@ antic Free Trade Agre@@ ements to the TT@@ IP .
the disputed private safety equipment for disputes between companies and nations are therefore to be replaced by a transparent system which is therefore significantly more traditional courts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set a system to determine the citizens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Commissioner Cec@@ ilia Malm@@ ström is to give effect to the performance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Swe@@ din has to bring the proposal to the EU negoti@@ ating position with the USA as the European negoti@@ ating position .
the German government announced support .
TT@@ IP should introduce the world &apos;s largest free trade zone with 800 million people .
the plans to reform current arbit@@ ration proceedings indicate that the EU states and the United States will select two independent judges for a new service in the United States .
they are to come to equal parts from the EU , the US , and third countries .
the second instance is provided for the first time .
it would allow it to collect up against judgments .
so far , the rules of proceedings involved in arbitr@@ ator , one interv@@ ene against the judgments were excluded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the discussion of the past months , it has become clear that citizens not trust the old IS@@ DS systems in fair@@ ness and justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; commented &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Jeremy Med@@ in@@ ns made his dé@@ p@@ or of the Prime Minister
proposed by the Prime Minister has been proposed by Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns since his election .
the new Labour Party Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n should give his dé@@ but@@ or in the Prime Minister &apos;s fra@@ ction and the first time with David Cameron .
M@@ R Cor@@ bi@@ n is set up in order to present the first of its six pre@@ paid issues shortly after lunch , generating its performance by the Media probably and the Labour MEP drawn near by the EU .
he demanded &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at that weekly event .
he has also said that he can sk@@ ip some meetings to sk@@ ip his colleagues .
the meeting will be proposed by the first parliamentary exam for Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns , because she has been a member of the Centre for his appointment and after his speech at the Tu@@ c Conference on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the Labour Party &apos;s decision was prov@@ oked during a commem@@ oration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of Battle of Britain in silence , cr@@ iti@@ que by a number of T@@ ory @-@ MP@@ S prov@@ okes and stood at the center of several titles .
the decision to sing M@@ R Cor@@ bi@@ ns &apos;s decision to sing the National An@@ them , has attention
&quot; &quot; &quot; an spokesperson on Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he had stood in respect of silence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he had the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her@@ o@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Sch@@ atten@@ u@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told in the BBC Two news night program , he had advised the Labour Party to sing the National An@@ them , &quot; ir@@ respective of his faith , that the mon@@ archy would be abolished .
almost a dozen of shadow @-@ professionals have refused to serve by Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s top team and she was called in differences between the economy , defence and foreign policy , while , less than a sixth of the Parliamentary Party , it was originally supported as a guide .
the political correspon@@ dent for the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences may also be stacked in the stages &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns statements on the position of European Union and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
M@@ R Cor@@ bi@@ kers said the Tu@@ c conference , that Labour to Labour requires the whole idea of a con@@ stra@@ int .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow @-@ working and r@@ ator minister , said the Party &quot; was very clear that only against the government plans to lower the limit of 26@@ ,000 pounds to 23@@ ,000 pounds .
M@@ R Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth British Executive Committee , with David Cameron , since then it &apos;s T@@ ory Chief , over the last decade , over the D@@ isp@@ atch Box in parliament .
the Labour Party , representing a different policies for politics , says that &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for Mr. Cameron and gave him more than 30.000 suggestions .
Is@@ lington North MP has said that the fra@@ ction of the Prime Minister is con@@ front@@ ally , and that he will act with both &quot; night@@ stands &quot; and that he has made , approaching serious problems like poverty , in@@ equality and challenges to focus on young people .
M@@ R Cor@@ by@@ n has said that Angela Eagle , the shadow of economic ministers , will be represented when he does not participate - for example , when Mr. Cameron is driving abroad .
he also taught the idea to hear that other colleagues must occasionally take the Word , and that he spoke to John Ber@@ man , the spokes@@ man of the sign@@ age , to interpre@@ t the problem .
when he was leaders in 2005 , Mr Cameron announced that he is negoti@@ ated by the politics of a &quot; cas@@ c@@ le theater &quot; in which he often worked with the Prime Minister &apos;s fra@@ ction . but a few years later he dre@@ amed that he had failed .

the Peg@@ gy poster depic@@ ts Lebanese for potato tweeter
potatoes or D@@ öner ?
the two is - and indeed in the potato d@@ yp@@ ass which is developed by the Ol@@ den@@ burger j@@ mb@@ al Han@@ i Al@@ h@@ ay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; inspired by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; potato &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; resolution &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on a poster the Peg@@ gy movement used Al@@ h@@ ay potato and meat together on a spe@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea brought it a poster on a Peg@@ gy with the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; potatoes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which he had seen acci@@ dental on TV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , in his loading a grill sk@@ ewer that is equiped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; this is multi@@ cul@@ t for the stomach , &quot; Al@@ h@@ ay believes .
the closure of Lebanon have now put to a patent attor@@ ney in Munich .
there , since recently , the authority has been protected as a utility patent since recently .
&quot; &quot; &quot; how many flesh and how many potatoes of the spe@@ ar will not be betrayed to . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only so much : &quot; it tast@@ es better together , &quot; he finds .

Met@@ Cli@@ launches floor - Camp@@ a@@ ign for B@@ aste Acqu@@ isition of al@@ di@@ arr@@ he@@ a
Met@@ ric tried to protect the IG@@ A branches in front of an Al@@ di &apos;s invasion in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholesaler distributor Met@@ EUR has started an ad@@ mis@@ sal campaign in order to defend its IG@@ A retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million $ al@@ di invasion .
whilst Al@@ di has prepared the opening of two sales centres and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia in the beginning of next year , Met@@ assi@@ mil@@ and IG@@ A vest@@ ments their relationships with local food suppliers and marketing the brand IG@@ A via Main@@ stream marketing and marketing over the soci@@ etal media , as well as events such as Adelaide @-@ Show .
IG@@ A tra@@ ders and suppliers are on board , with brands such as ice producer Pet@@ o from Dun@@ de@@ bor@@ ough , who distributed in IG@@ A stores of samples and shop @-@ owner who sell tickets for the South Australian soccer league to lo@@ yal customers .
it is expected that the cash bonus of his defense strategy are released on September 29th , when the wholesaler being introduced to its annual investors @-@ strategy day .
it is much on the game because South Australia and Western Australia requires almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A @-@ l@@ ash@@ s and higher profit margin than Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A network in the eastern region .
shop@@ pers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ously par@@ aly@@ sis and IG@@ A retailers can have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to about 14 percent in Eastern Australia .
however , anal@@ ysts as Morgan Stanley reported that Al@@ di will take up twelve months after opening of its first markets around five percent of the food market in these two countries , but mainly independent retailers can take away .
a report released in this week released by the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stanley , to win $ 360 million in revenue per year and $ 1.5 billion euros by the end of 2016 .
this progn@@ osis is based on the ass@@ umption that Al@@ di will be opened in SA , 30 branches in the next year , and will generate revenue of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each markets .
the loss in food and gro@@ c@@ eries and the quantities on metal @-@ c@@ ash@@ s might be cash to some $ 13 million from interest and tax , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said Mr K@@ ier@@ ath .
at the same time , Met@@ assi@@ mil@@ ations shares in the eastern states , mainly on Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey of Roy Morgan found out that IG@@ A @-@ purchases recognized the h@@ ott@@ est .
Morgan Stanley took places for food and gro@@ c@@ ers by 3.8 percent in 2016 , 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 and 2.1 percent in 2018 will drop to 10.3 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told in Melbourne , that Met@@ is probably cash out in a decade .
Met@@ rics dropped es to react publicly on the comments of Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ purchase has been raised by Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
IG@@ As Market share has gone down from 18 percent to 14 percent , and imports from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s food and food trade , which has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , reflects the operating costs of operating costs in simultaneous pressure to turnover and mar@@ gins .
however , the wholes@@ al@@ ers are operating and invests more than 150 million dollars to increase sales prices of col@@ es and vo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths , in hundreds of products each week , and IG@@ A retailers can help to improve fresh foods and improve a better selection of private label foods .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s main managing director Ian Mor@@ rice said that the prices adap@@ tations and shop @-@ raising software will be low and hopes that the wholesaler being will return to profit growth for the first time in four years 2017 .
Than@@ ksgiving Kok@@ k@@ is is supported by the president of the Australian tennis courts Steve Heal@@ y
Than@@ ksgiving Kok@@ k@@ is earns rather praise to criticism for his behaviour .
Than@@ ksgiving Kok@@ k@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; collabor@@ ative damage &quot; in the shortest storm by his friend Nick M@@ interv@@ ene and deser@@ ves the opinion of the President of the Australian tennis association Steve Heal@@ y rather praise as criticism for his own behavior .
co@@ ca@@ ver@@ is , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , will eventually be called the &quot; Special KS &quot; , fought from Turkey &apos;s not@@ ori@@ ous conflict with St@@ an WA@@ W@@ R@@ IN@@ KA at the Montreal Masters .
in a spring qualification in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati , shortly afterwards , Kok@@ k@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Harrison twice visited by the refer@@ ee , who cried out : &quot; WA@@ W@@ R@@ IN@@ KA have fought against Kyr@@ to , and I should beat the child . &quot;
during he was last seen , as he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket , after a hit a potential US open victory of Richard Gas@@ quet , co@@ ca@@ k@@ ak@@ is was def@@ ended with Heal@@ y .
the te@@ ens is currently in Glasgow , in the competition with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ final against Great brit@@ ain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a thing that I really inv@@ oked me is the fact that Than@@ y was a little of the battle at my view , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Heal@@ y did &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has broken a m@@ ack@@ et , when he lost a bat in the US Open , but he is not the first player , who has broken one lo@@ him from hair@@ less with himself , and I know Tan@@ i a good enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he really enjoyed an ultra @-@ good behaviour in the US Open , even under the fairly pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Harrison and so on , and I think he earned much recognition .
he has a great team around you , he has a great family around you , and I believe that he was treated a little too hard .
he is a very big 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard because it fits in the team and so on he has never faced a problem with the other players , he &apos;s being trained hard , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deser@@ ves it to be judged according to its own service .
Heal@@ y supported the decision to take into account the decision taken by Cy@@ rus on Friday which starts on Friday and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the correct one for all but he sec@@ ures the man out of Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long term permanent feature to the team . &quot;
&quot; first we wish that the team is completely focused on competition and not all around the contro@@ vers@@ y around &#91; Cy@@ rus &#93; &quot; stated Heal@@ y .
and I believe it is supposed to have managed the way in what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray . he is trying to do some worst problems , but we try to give him the consequences of the lim@@ b , in which he can only think about it , and it &apos;s best for the team and it is best for him .
Europe refugee crisis : Hungary explains emergency , elimin@@ ating the border , continues refugees return
Hungary explains the not@@ ation and securing the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and kept all that tried to come into the country illeg@@ ally , with the aim to stop the influ@@ x of migrants .
as a coup d , chaos was followed at the border , after hundreds of migrants den@@ oun@@ ced in a country of Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and a learning government responded to the country .
people who fled before violence were imp@@ lic@@ ated for an unknown time in a land stre@@ ak on the road between the two check@@ points of the countries and so build@@ ed tents and settled there .
but fru@@ str@@ ations grew .
when a police helicopter exposed over them , the Mig@@ rants &apos; Op@@ ens the Border ! &quot; and cried out against the Hungarian will@@ ing@@ ness to fight .
lay some refer@@ ed to protest and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s foreign minister said it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ acceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants would return from Hungary to more and more from Macedonia and Greece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) I want to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ision .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will take place in the next few days with Brussels and other countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Iv@@ ica D@@ ac@@ ic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tur@@ mo@@ il at the Hungarian @-@ Serbian army came to meet one day after the 28 @-@ nations blo@@ c at a strict me@@ ander@@ ing policy in Brussels .
however , the ministers agreed to divide the responsibility for 40,000 people who sought refuge in the shr@@ inking Italy and Greece . an agreement was concluded that the EU countries would have more than 120@@ ,000 refugees , among them also some of Hungary .
on Tuesday , Angela Merkel and Austria demanded an special summit on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
but Hungary , however , put its hope in the action of Brussels and its neigh@@ bors .
the emergency that was proclaimed in two southern regions , the government gave more powers to conquer the crisis , so that they were able to speed roads and asylum procedures .
the Hungarian Minister of Foreign Affairs Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ j@@ ar@@ to said in fact that his country give the construction of a bar@@ bed wire to Rum@@ ania , in order to stop the influ@@ x of migrants - after having finished a fence at the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News @-@ Cor@@ dent Charlie D. &apos; Ag@@ ata told us that there were even periods in the race , the bar@@ bed wire fence built between Hungary and Serbia .
in the past months , Hungary has become a lot of war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East , to a considerable un@@ sur@@ pass and to the entry into the European Union .
Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban , however , has in@@ si@@ sted that most upcoming business refugees are , which are in search of a better life , and not a non @-@ war refugees , which is strongly opposed to other EU @-@ states , among them Germany , is present .
the new laws , which came into force around midnight in Hungary , make the crossing the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high Z@@ a@@ uns , to build the government along the southern border towards Serbia , also su@@ stain more pen@@ alties for condemned the traff@@ ic@@ kers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian government explained its emergency state &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said government spokes@@ man Z@@ olt@@ an K@@ ov@@ acs repor@@ ters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the Parliament must still vote on the use of the military , which is expected for next week , but repor@@ ter of Associated Press will have previously looked at the border with armed troops with vehicles and dogs .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security adviser for Or@@ ban , said that the authorities recommended 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others were already penet@@ rated into the country .
they come from over they dam@@ n the fence , they are now in police custody and accused of off@@ ences after the new laws .
authorities are easy to repair the fence .
Hungarian officials concluded two of the seven border trials in Serbia , after an expedition wagon with bar@@ bed wire to close the border .
chaos converted the most important border crossing close to Ros@@ ed@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hungary opened a small office in a metal container in order to process the data of people and a crowd is pressed in order to enter into chaos .
about 20 managed to happen , but thousands remained outside .

the former Secretary of State Hill@@ ary Clinton continues to lead a second @-@ digit lead in the democratic race at national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins against the floor .
Clinton has now backed the support of 47 percent of the democratic voters in the elections ( 58 percent earlier ) while S@@ anders is ranked second , with 27 percent ( rise by 17 percent ) .
Vice President Bi@@ den , who has not announced his president &apos;s presidency , will receive the support for the presidency of 15 percent of the democratic voters .
more than five months before the election , most democratic voters say that it is too early in order to say that their opinion is stated , the candidate can support them .
but Clinton &apos;s supp@@ orters are wise in their election as one of the other candidates .
in a number of demo@@ graphic groups , Clinton has lost different wins at a number of demo@@ graphic groups since the C@@ BS @-@ News @-@ survey .
Clinton maintains a huge margin at women and moder@@ ates , but it decreased .
their support for the men is decreased significantly , and S@@ anders is by only 5 points behind .
Clinton &apos;s advantage for democratic voters under 50 years has been rap@@ ed , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same height .
Clinton has yet another lead over earlier voters .
in the past month Clinton flew into parliamentary head with a double @-@ digit lead over the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point advantage over this group .
about half of the democratic voters in the country &apos;s pres@@ election show that they would strongly support Clinton by the party .
a quarter would support her with some pre@@ ferences , and 15 percent would only support them because they are the candidate .
they would not support six percent .
perhaps not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supp@@ orters are especially fascin@@ ated by her .
the views are m@@ ise even in the ones who are currently not support Clinton - just about a quarter would support them .
while 48 per cent of the democratic voters say that she therefore backed with enthusiasm , say less republi@@ can elec@@ torate , against their leading candidate , Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
if Clinton &apos;s supp@@ orter responded to an open question , why they want the candidate to be the candidate . ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it &apos;s time is that a woman President will ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best can@@ did@@ acy for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Clinton &apos;s data is also reported to Clinton &apos;s connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
consent to deal with problems and voters are also cited .
since the vice president again puts a potential for the presidential tax in the orph@@ an@@ age , 57 per cent of the democratic voters will see it in the race - although a third one believes it should not be done .
if democratic voters will be asked for the party , who would be the second choice for the party , bi@@ den is at the top .
by Clinton &apos;s citizens more than half that Bi@@ den would have had their second choice far before S@@ anders .
Select Bi@@ den decided not to run the nom@@ ination of the Democrats Group , Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s lead increases S@@ anders , 20 points with Bi@@ den in the race at 30 points without him in the race .
fifty @-@ five percent of the democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances to win the election ; however , this number has declined by 78 percent in the last month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; bi@@ den is only a second in this measurement , but the percentage that seem to be regarded as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; selectable &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , with the question of what is important for a Candidate , Democratic Vot@@ ers call to be more than voters .
similarly as in the last month , no longer Democratic candidate or potential candidate for that sel@@ ector may prove the elections as un@@ acceptable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Democratic candidate or potential candidates produce good results in some important features in the sel@@ ections of their party sel@@ ections &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
added to the Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as tru@@ thful and tru@@ st@@ worthy and powerful exec@@ ut@@ ities .
biograph@@ ical point in the course of the three candidates is best from hon@@ esty while Clinton &apos;s strength is .
thirty per cent of the democratic voters think that Clinton is hon@@ est@@ ly and tru@@ st@@ worthy , twice as many say the above S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not have no opinion from him .
Democratic Vot@@ ers ( General elections also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their opinions .
with all these measurements , about a quarter of democratic voters do not have opinion of S@@ anders .
since questions regarding Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server being continued as an Foreign Minister , most of the Democratic voters are happy with their explanation of the matter and say that it did not affect their opinions .
but there is a different history in the American public .
half the Americans is satisfied with their explanation , whereas only one @-@ third is satisfied .
the public opinion of this talk was in March , shortly after the problem of light was donated .
most Americans said that the E @-@ Mail @-@ contro@@ vers@@ y had no impact on their general opinions of Clinton , even though 36 percent said that their mind would still have seriously deteri@@ or@@ ated .
there are mainly Repub@@ lic@@ ans , more than six of 10 who say that Clinton has really recovered .
although Clinton is considered to be hon@@ est and tru@@ st@@ worthy of the election of their party , this is still a problem for them among registered voters , just 32 percent less than in tru@@ st@@ worthy and tru@@ st@@ worthy , eight percent less than in the last month and 15 points less in May .
62 percent of voters will not receive a tru@@ st@@ worthy and tru@@ st@@ worthy person .
at the same time , 55 percent of those entitled to vote is also not tru@@ st@@ worthy and not tru@@ st@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tr@@ ump did not receive good grades for guiding .
of the six tested candidates , Be@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush were best out of honour .
a majority looks more hon@@ est@@ ly than hon@@ est@@ ly , but as with Car@@ son many no opinions were of him .
the error rate for the sample of 351 Democratic Vot@@ ers went by 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son returns to Donald Tr@@ ump in Poland
Ben Car@@ son is located in the latest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times located behind Donald Tr@@ ump

the survey also revealed that Car@@ son does good for demo@@ graphic groups and then sur@@ passes tr@@ ump under Republi@@ can elec@@ torate in higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio , governor John Kas@@ im , has been governor of Wis@@ con@@ sins , Scott Walker , who fell to the deep@@ est , namely from 10 % in the last month to 2 % .
the former subject of Florida @-@ Governor Je@@ b Bush , former Governor of Ar@@ kan@@ sas / Florida and Florida @-@ Senator Marco Rub@@ io are 6 % on third place .
the error margin in the sample of 376 persons of Republi@@ can elec@@ torate in this latest survey is Plus or minus 6 % and was implemented in September .
the latest CNN / OR@@ C survey , which was last week released , shows that Car@@ son is in circulation , with 19 % support in the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , behind Tr@@ ump with 32 % support .

five members of the Brotherhood , with the death of a Bar@@ uch College @-@ Neul@@ ings
almost two years after a student during the student rit@@ ual is a student residence in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , died , M@@ ord@@ ed were handed over against five people .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ PSI bro@@ ods in September 2013 has been brutal and delayed by his transport into the hospital , leading to his death in September 2013 .
officers said that he had been captured with his eyes with a 30 pound back@@ pack filled with sand , and attacked , while he tried to attack over a frozen field to a destination .
Mr. Den@@ g compl@@ ained about head@@ aches , then he fell in mind .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ PSI leaders did not call the emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g was mighty , and they waited for an hour before they brought him into a hospital , so the police arrested .
however , they had the time to switch D@@ eng@@ s appar@@ el to see his symptoms , and Andy Men@@ g , sei@@ ze the national president of the Brotherhood to sei@@ ze advice , said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; on this point , the members and utensils came to hide and set the Brotherhood &apos;s probably through Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Poli@@ mark Wagner . &quot;
he could not revi@@ ved , and he died in the next morning to his injuries .
after a aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g repeatedly has repeatedly been weak@@ ened with bl@@ unt effect on the head , tor@@ so and upper th@@ igh@@ s .
&quot; for many families were destroyed by the Sch@@ ic@@ ans of the Brotherhood . at least one student , since 1970 , a student dies in the Sch@@ ic@@ ans , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer , the D@@ eng@@ s family , in a declaration .
Bru@@ der@@ ships and their members must be drawn to account ; and this step by authorities is very important .
a County Grand Jury from Monroe received an indictment due to Mor@@ ning &apos;s third party for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of attacks and formation of a criminal organisation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not only want to represent the participating person , but if they have an organization , which - officially or officially , this will also go to account , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood and the national bro@@ therhood can withdraw their affili@@ ation to the local group .
happen if the F@@ ed increases interest
a interest @-@ rate hike and the e@@ ye@@ es will fall into the sl@@ ender , ra@@ ging for bonds , and the economy is disper@@ sed into recession .
we know this .
what we do not know , how long will it take before and how long will it be .
particularly in particular , the history of the economy does only provide low guidance for the exp@@ iry .
a recession is released within just 11 months after the first interest rate and lasted for 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ vity of the Federal Reserve by raising the interest rates are often , if not always , a factor in the same as the economy and the financial assets react .
therefore , representatives of the United States Central Bank have stressed that investors should not concentrate on going on when it starts to increase interest rates , but rather to the period that is required for norm@@ alisation .
in fact , multiple variables are playing a role .
in the end , market participants could notice that all the exc@@ it@@ ement could possibly exc@@ essive due to a interest @-@ rate .
&quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis is being interpreted by some as a signal for the &quot; fair Money &quot; era , &quot; said Julian J@@ ess@@ op , Chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers .
in contrast , we do not expect the gradu@@ al return of U.S. interest to normal heights , but still on a low level to seem to se@@ is@@ mic shock , that seem to be many .
that does not mean that there is no impact .
here is a look at historical current trends , how some areas of business might react :
as seen on the market last month , interest @-@ taking interest rate can make it possible for a@@ while .
as soon as the increase is true , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; there seems to be a tend@@ ency to decrease assets between 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which contra@@ dic@@ ated the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said German @-@ bank anal@@ ysts in a recent study what had happened to interest rates of the F@@ ed .
more precisely , the market has mostly seen in the upward trend - about 14 percent - on its way to interest @-@ rate hike , reas@@ on@@ ably flat in the 250 days following an average return to 500 days , with an average return in over six past cycles from 14.4 percent to Bob D@@ oll , Chief Investment @-@ Strat@@ os at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
the Deutsche Bank predicted that the effects on the shares ten@@ ds will occur later in the increase cycle and the return is to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest income increases them often .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is con@@ fron@@ ted with some conditions , which previously not gave a recession and could accelerate at a recession .
it is extremely remarkable that GDP will be in the vicinity of his lowest point with interest @-@ rate hike .
according to Deutsche Bank , the nominal interest rate since 1950 decreased only twice the nominal GDP of 4.5 percent .
although the second quarter of 2015 was at 3.6 percent , only few hop@@ ing that this will end up and expect just 1.5 percent for the third quarter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; interest rates among a frag@@ ile economic setting could be ris@@ ky and thro@@ wing the question , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether it is different &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
market participants have made all year up to a french website by the F@@ ed , and all eyes were addressed to the Federal Open Market Committee this week on Thursday .
while many Strat@@ ford and econom@@ ists believe , the FO@@ MC one might appro@@ ve a rise in this meeting , there &apos;s only a chance of 25 percent .
&quot; in our study , all the increase @-@ cycles of 1950 @-@ today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing sw@@ elling of GDP and pre @-@ tax mit@@ es were very fast after the start of recovery in the shade , &quot; says the report .
in contrast , this is a clearly a slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the actual cycle is by far the longest , which has been waiting since the last recession with the end of the last recession which was 35 month and so far is 74 months .
the solid income was also vol@@ ati@@ l since the market takes a rate hike , and the pattern is fairly similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that bonds is faster than in 2010 , when it is necessary to change its strategic course .
in bonds , the R@@ end@@ ings will change the direction once the first increase in the cycle is made .
at the end of the increase cycle , the bond will fall immediately , the Deutsche Bank .
the strateg@@ ist of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the increase in reductions in interest rates will bring b@@ ite on longer and shorter bonds and lead to a prec@@ urs@@ ing of the curve .
highly interest bonds often bring up even in such a climate that even though &quot; we are still c@@ auti@@ ous to expect higher income , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed In@@ come anal@@ ysts at Schw@@ ab , in an analysis .
it is interesting that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the value of the dollar and the decline of inflation , there are some signs in which the market has adjusted to the stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest rates , increasing the recei@@ v@@ ables , cre@@ ators , l@@ ending opinions and popularity has increased - all the characteristics of the market , if the F@@ ed intensi@@ fied its strategy .
in a large and complete business , businesses who will be able to benefit from greater part of their business activities in the US will benefit from interest rates and to become local products .
multin@@ ational companies with high debts are worse due to rising demand in the global market for rising demand and as well as financing their debts .
&quot; the story shows that &quot; Quality and &quot; shares tend to react very positi@@ vely three months after initial interest @-@ rate , &quot; said Gold@@ man Sachs @-@ Analy@@ st in a report of the customer .
companies with strong balance sheet companies climbed by 5 percentage points on average for each of the interest income in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
companies with high @-@ capital yields and low liquidity during their shares tra@@ des their counter@@ parts with a low level of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts are becoming a big problem .
company with a high share of flexible interest will lose the most , said Gold@@ man .
outside the pure stock market , consumers are also benefit from the increasing dollar .
savings might be accepted by higher earnings , even if experts from different opinion can be held fast as fast as possible .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says the member of the parliament Andrew B@@ ingham
conservative MEP , Member of the Parliament , critic@@ ized the transmitter for his &quot; du@@ mm@@ ing &quot;
he argu@@ ed that he is becoming increasingly different from commercial rival .
he also glorified the BBC Music Awards , saying that they only benef@@ ited the Br@@ its
parliament @-@ collectors Dam@@ ien Collins attacked the show The Voice on and said that this is not too original .
&quot; &quot; &quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; converts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is asser@@ ted a leading Parliament , strengthening new pressure on the transmitter , that he does something doing something to do the private broadcast@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; con@@ doms , Andrew B@@ ingham has also said the BBC @-@ Bos@@ sen that the publicly owned radio station &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stup@@ id &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly on its commercial competitors is to be different . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I &apos;m using the word &quot; stup@@ id &quot; but it seems to turn to Classic FM by turning , &quot; he said .
he also ranked the BBC Music Awards , starting in last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which began last year , seem to be only one another name for The Br@@ its .
so , if you &apos;re trying to do something different - this is two spontaneous examples , where you only quote what is already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham .
BBC Music Director tells the conclusion back and argu@@ ed that BBC Radio 3 reveals widely before its commercial competitors , when playing live music and enligh@@ ten@@ ment of the public .
what I learn from Radio 3 , I will learn about classical music somewhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music which was really sur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the dedication of Radio 3 , new music and new works in order , I think also really for importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey said that the c@@ ures should eng@@ age in order to eng@@ age the audience , when it did it in the past , because the British did not be informed about classical music .
radio 3 , however , was not the only life available to BBC &apos;s production , at the hearing of the Committee for the S@@ election of Culture , Media and Sport , under fire , to step off the commercial rival to his feet .
the T@@ ory Mark Dam@@ ien Collins attacked The Voice - the musical talent of the BBC , which was bought by the Dutch producers Tal@@ pa media for an estimated cost of £ 22 million .
see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and is not especially prominent ?
Lord Hall observed that the BBC 1 Show - with Pal@@ oma College and Boy George as a judge - was produced on a special BBC way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added , he wishes that the company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finds a hit from our in @-@ house barn , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it set the next time a entertainment series . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to exclu@@ de the order of further rows of The Voice in the future , or pay money of the commission for other entert@@ aining sizes .
net sales grew in August at the most slow@@ est and the Black Friday can be responsible for this .
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in sales .
within the last month has been the lowest result since the beginning of records in the year 2000 .
online Sales increased three years ago by using cell phones to purchase .
experts believe that the Black Friday in November has slow@@ ed down .
for over a decade , the virtual shopping is bo@@ lic@@ ated , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have transformed into cl@@ ergy .
however , experts say that there are now signs of online sales , after new numbers showed just seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the year &apos;s total expenditure for August presented the lowest rise in growth since the beginning of the records in 2000 , with only five percent increase from the previous year .
experts say that online sales are stag@@ n@@ ating , after new numbers showed just seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you consider growth rates for pre @-@ years and go back to 2000 , then Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , publisher of the IM@@ RG flag fell to the Guardian .
he declared that the online sales increased three years ago , when the buyer began to make purchases on purchases .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , for example home on the sofa .
but now this comm@@ itt@@ ens itself , and we will probably experience how it reduces growth .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon , which was imported from the United States , is cited as a reason for the in@@ bound sales .
experts believe that buyers will maintain its purchases prior to this event , which will take place on Friday last Friday in November .
last year it turned out five times the average number of buyers to make her bar@@ gain , and some dealers had collap@@ sed .
experts believe that Black Friday , at which the buyers would fight for bar@@ gain , who could cause buyers to buy purchases .
a study of the British Retail Con@@ sortium took place that from £ 5 issues a little more than 1 £ online was spent .
in some products like TV and washing machines , more than one third of the shopping is now carried out on web shops .
at the same time more than a quarter of men &apos;s clothes and shoes are purchased online rather than in the capit@@ als in the interior cities .

Saudi officials already announced that H@@ add@@ endum to thousands of people who continue to go on the city will continue to go on .
today king Sal@@ man said , the Bin Laden group would not have been allowed to leave the arm of the crane when he was not used .
a g@@ pres@@ crip@@ tions by the decree of the decree issued by the state Saudi Press Agency mentioned that the bin Laden group is responsible for the break@@ down .
the English @-@ speaking service of News Agency reported in detail that this detail said , however , that the leadership of the company had been forbidden .
at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man was to reveal that which fell to the fall of the crane , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims collap@@ sed , which will be taking place later this month .
the bin Laden group was published not on a statement about the collapse of the crane , and their representatives were not available for a statement .
the Royal Decree cont@@ acted also the group because of non @-@ current security measures and because they did not co@@ operate with meteor@@ ologist .
dozens of cor@@ ps have sur@@ round M@@ ec@@ ca sur@@ geri@@ es as part of the massive construction project leading by the Bin Laden group .
the bin Laden family has been connected to the Saudi Arabia &apos;s premises for decades and becomes greater construction projects .

it is rep@@ uted that Brit@@ ons put their hamm@@ ers and a brush in favour of the employing Greek professionals who carry out work in her home
if you were sk@@ ill@@ ful with a hammer or a brush to handle walls around walls , it probably belong to a minority in today .
before Britain more and more crafts@@ men employ to do mist@@ akes jobs in their houses , the head of the company was behind B &amp; Q .
V@@ é@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new managing director of King@@ f@@ isher , who owns the DIY chain , said that a large rise in the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe , offering services to deep sea prices , have meanwhile been over@@ hau@@ led .
therefore the King@@ f@@ isher , 200 further Scre@@ w@@ fix stores is planning to setup tra@@ des@@ people and close 60 outlets from B &amp; Q .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said they wish to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops than eight of ten merchant decisions in the shop are affected by women .
at the moment , the men were silent .
she said it was necessary to present the growing demo@@ graphic trends that report more female single @-@ households that have more renov@@ ations than in the past .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it still works a majority of men in our stores .
we must move it stronger to a balance .
approximately half of our customers come from women with 80 per cent of all decisions about the purchase of articles by women .
women play a big role in decision process .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women to the top of a British in the F@@ T@@ SE@@ 100 index , has also acted her top team to reflect the same number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ F@@ isher is almost the only company which has occupied exactly 50 percent of the teams with women , including its management and CFO .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a deliber@@ ate decision - diversity is a key topic here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ F@@ isher already benef@@ ited a decline in Half @-@ Year Award and sales after the Group had dest@@ ined the costs for closing the shops .
due to the trends - King@@ f@@ isher , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q has to open 200 new branches .

the accused pleaded not guilty .
one of them was also charged for abuse of families .
he was acquitted of the judgment in May 2008 .
the current process was ad@@ jour@@ ned .
according to the Pro@@ curator @-@ General Robert Ri@@ ffel , was found in the investigation , that the def@@ endants were agreed to combine into their functions in the years 2006 to 2011 .
the costs are approximately 400@@ ,000 euros .
the sports are also charged due to financial agreements .
this fact was replaced by the President of the Sh@@ ov@@ en@@ Council , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in , Germany .
it should be negoti@@ ated at a later date .
for the design of im@@ lo@@ yal , the defence follows the non @-@ asset inf@@ ot@@ ation in the association at no time .
the sports function only calcul@@ ates the damages and the sport club , for which she worked from 1982 until 2011 , and in which she had invested much time and money , equity has been made around 600@@ ,000 for@@ b@@ illing ( rd : 44@@ ,000 euros ) in 2001 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , we were ahead of the situation : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we continue the Club next or prosp@@ ered ? &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said one of the accused , in his photographic book of the financial report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in his colleagues and co @-@ def@@ endants , he decided to take this task .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have rated the money that lay down our life insurance than security with the Bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said during commissioning . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association has been agreed with : you can ad@@ minister the money free , no debt can be made . &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , it is said , corresponding to the corresponding financial success the dis@@ bur@@ sement of the charges brought up until 1991 .
therefore , one part of the damages occurred only years later , namely from 2003 , when a plus has been on the account .
all the col@@ d@@ ots and non @-@ detailed variations existed , the former Ob@@ jects the former Ob@@ jects are explained .
the accounts and tran@@ scripts that distri@@ butes the two def@@ endants , the second accused said .
why did the cash out@@ payments were not appe@@ ated in detail , the judge asked the judge .
the association did not interest in detail for the financing , important either the debt of cancellation , so the answer .
when an investigation began in 2011 , an amount of € 120@@ ,000 was credited to the recognition .
the def@@ endants had been , defin@@ ing the accused .
this securities account was in the name of the second def@@ endants , and was not known to the Society according to that statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted to know the judge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was not answered for a long answer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He told us that it was the best thing for the association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if something had happened something , nobody knew something of this money , the prosecutor presented its office in the room .
the accused was inform@@ ing , just@@ i@@ fi@@ ably the functional .
this transfer was formulated as &quot; damage &quot; damage . &quot;
why do not claim ? why judge and state refused to know .
in particular , the first accused began to agree with this formulation because the association was never suffered a damage to the association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what shall I do when the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You are all of the tail@@ or &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a lawyer ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , he said the functional , he never calcul@@ ates a cent content , he calcul@@ ates only s@@ iting money and di@@ ets .
he informed the association € 1,000 per month in di@@ ets , the actual effort but actual effort was much higher , he added .
exact documents for the early years could not show the def@@ endants .
they were , according to an initial assessment , that all were identified as correct , declared no more for them , declared them .
during the kilometer money , the second def@@ endants had joined .
all Beh@@ avi@@ or are in cash , along with this , he had to leave the habitation of a habitation by a place of residence in his residence , he stated in his statement .
the main hearing will be continued on 23 September with the survey of witnesses .

time of Decision on interest rates for the US banknote
the world observed , if US music bank goes on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to meet the important decision to make it for the first time since almost a decade could be raised or not .
a survey conducted among 80 econom@@ ists , found by Reuters , found that a little more than half , which will still do this , now think that the F@@ ed will continue to wait a little longer and will keep interest rates at the present level of 0 - 0.25 % .
it is a historic event since it has been seven years ago since the F@@ ed interest was set to NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time , we approach to a situation in which a large central bank will be leaving the zero line and a process of norm@@ alisation of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ intelligence , Head of employee at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the US economy is based on a relatively high level of performance , trillion dollars are added to the balance and generate just a low inflation .
however the F@@ ed cannot ign@@ ore the less steep outlook at global conditions .
she warned the markets to raise ourselves to an increase , but the signs indicate that the od@@ ds against such a step are good .
the decision is expected to be announced at 20.00 CET on Thursday
death sc@@ ou@@ ches at Delta State University , left compensation
after the shooting and killing of his gir@@ l@@ friend into Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he later shot his colleagues and killed - wrote Sh@@ annon record a note to say that he couldn &apos;t make him &quot; sorry for him &quot; but he could not do it &quot; to him &quot; by authorities on Tuesday .
the police in G@@ auti@@ cs , Mississippi , said that Lamb , lecturer in ge@@ ography and social scientific education at the Delta State University , called the emergency number to 10 : 00 on Monday morning .
and he said , He was shot on someone , and someone was killed .
Lamb said to the staff of the emergency call that police officers to send by police officers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he mentioned that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet little dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the house , but he who doesn &apos;t distur@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but probably will be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked him a nurse in his name , but he didn &apos;t want him .
Lamb has no explanation for his feet .
when the police operated the scene , they found the body of Amy Pr@@ ent@@ iss , 41 , and a handwritten note from Lamb , 45 , said : &quot; I felt sorry for me , I would do it wrong .
I loved Martha , and she is the only woman who loved me . &quot;
after writing the note , record 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he became E@@ than Schmidt , a professor for history , killed before he finally took his own life on Monday evening , when police officers attempted to en@@ forced him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Univers@@ ily president William La@@ For@@ ge said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he knew nothing from a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there has been something to Mr Lam@@ bs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite reports on Monday , the Lamb would supp@@ os@@ edly testified that Pr@@ un@@ ite had a relationship with Schmidt this day , &quot; there &apos;s no information on Tuesday , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; tri@@ angular relationship . &quot;
squ@@ e@@ eze was released by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said that she was married for seven years , as a &quot; good man . &quot;
the two divor@@ ced two years ago , but they t@@ arri@@ ed there .

Know@@ les said that Pr@@ un@@ ite , who possessed a dog called Light@@ ning , has prevailed for nearly three years .
&quot; you always wanted to help other people , &quot; said Know@@ les
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lamb said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I called upon a certain date on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he did not go into prison &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when police went on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later in that night , Absalom passed his car to the side , fled to foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
Lamb received a doctorate in spring 2015 from the Delta State University to a PhD , and has prevailed on the University &apos;s website .

Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa develops the Group by
the Lufthansa is planning a major restructuring .
every year , the Lufthansa Group is allowed to save half a billion euros in the year alone with a better organization .
the approx . 1000 senior exec@@ utives will cost the workplace in roughly 150 markets around the world .
there are new negotiations with the pilot mechanism .
the Lufthansa develops its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates the Euro@@ wings nearby .
the goal of the re@@ orientation shall be an annual contribution of around € 500 million per year for cost @-@ sales and replacement syn@@ ergi@@ es , fore@@ seen the airline on Wednesday .
in the future , there is no Executive Board anymore for the passenger business in future .
the flags of the Euro@@ bike sol@@ der series should be as independent as possible .
in the Executive Board about Carsten Sp@@ oh@@ r , Karl Ulrich Su@@ pra@@ t will be responsible for the wings for Euro@@ wings in the future .
with the re @-@ setting , Sp@@ oh@@ r under@@ scores the importance of Euro@@ wings , which the Group aims to compete in the future with Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ Jet .
to date , the organization of the 120 000 employees was complex .
the airline operated under the roof of the Airline and allocated three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros .
new negotiations with the pilots
the collective conflict with the pilot Association of the pit ( VC ) should be resumed after the after@@ ward strike of the strike on this Thursday .
I divided the union .
the theme of talks will be the last running control of pilots .
cockpit Â &quot; get faster with a projected record result in a year with a projected result .
the trade between trade union and airline led to various strikes in the past few months .
in the background the pilot concept &quot; Wings &quot; is next to the transfer supply of the pilot .
it fore@@ sees that the Lufthansa reaches the fight against competitors and con@@ gr@@ ate con@@ gr@@ ate Euro@@ wings on the concert .

Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United can &apos;t play monthly inc@@ ture because of double inc@@ ture
Luke Sha@@ w was dealt with the Champions League in Manchester at the PS@@ V Light campaign , a double inc@@ ture of its right leg .
while this earned the left eye def@@ ending and closing it for at least six months from games , Louis van G@@ aal is given the hope that Sha@@ w is able to play back in this season .
the breach was shown in the 15th minute by a promising attack by H@@ é@@ cular Mor@@ eno , after 20 years old Sha@@ w was broken into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated on the field for nine minutes and needed oxygen before he was transferred to the hospital .
van G@@ aal said : &quot; he has a double the t@@ inc@@ ture and lies in the hospital . &quot;
he was re@@ laid out morning or maybe a day later and then moved to Manchester .
it is aw@@ ful - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it &apos;s very difficult , and then takes it fantastic .
in the dressing unit he had a oxygen sensor .
he wept .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you love one double structure , then it will be six months , and he will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed to be happy , a red card and the susp@@ ending of a El@@ f@@ m .
Nic@@ ola R@@ izz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , has not been sentenced to Mexican .
van G@@ aal suggested that the Italian refer@@ ee had er@@ red .
you can judge for yourself if I say that a d @-@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very worse attack with both legs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a T@@ we@@ et on Sha@@ ws account &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words can &apos;t describe how to rub@@ ble my path to the recovery , I &apos;m coming back again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here related : Manchester United suffered the loss of Luke Sha@@ w near the PS@@ V
with the European Championship in France , the UK def@@ enders in France has an additional inc@@ enti@@ ve to recover until the coming June .
Philli@@ p Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it is a very worst case . &quot;
if a player leaves that way from injury to square , all are very sad .
it is never the intention of any player to viol@@ ate a opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a sur@@ pass , as Mexico lost against Van Ga@@ as Netherlands as during the World Cup 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very hard because it was not his intention to viol@@ ate the opponent , and if you hear that it is a very worst case , it is not good &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing that I could see was the ball , who was sitting in another direction , so it had looked at it as if he had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 , Mor@@ eno : &quot; I know how it feels like it feels heavy like that .
I feel really po@@ or@@ ly . I feel sorry .
the PS@@ V @-@ player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also at the hospital - after a oul@@ itting of Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely does David Cameron see the Lor@@ ax better ?
it is a thing that you can learn all parents : if your child loves a book , it will not take long until you know it almost completely .
unless you &apos;re maybe David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of care systems , his favorite children &apos;s book decided to call his favorite child book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax which was released in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult choice , Mr Cameron reads in a message on the website of Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; mer@@ ry , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to give my children , because it seems always a picture or message that we have missed so far . &quot;
all well and good , except for the following sub@@ section , in which Cameron is supp@@ os@@ edly describes the action of the book , instead re@@ loc@@ ating a level of film release from 2012 , added the new characters and details to enlarge the pretty little original text .
&quot; amongst the w@@ alled town of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature is gone , and even the air is a good tree , she hopes to see a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , destro@@ ying their wish to be a real tree , was fulfilled . a love story was Dr. Se@@ uss , the real name of Theodor Se@@ uss ho@@ stage , and who died in 1991 , however is completely unknown .
as if that &apos;s not yet being ho@@ ur@@ ly enough : the text shown by Cameron , which is shown on the website of Internet Movie Database , is the way : &quot; in the surrounding city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a good fortune , a boy named Ted , to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y to capture the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although Yes , to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems to be extremely familiar with Cameron &apos;s action , such as the local environment through the capital , trees , such as the local environment by the well @-@ known Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ ckey , car@@ av@@ our@@ ing , &quot; that will be devast@@ ated in the name of trees . &quot;
most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a promot@@ er , who did not read The Lor@@ ax for 20 times in a row .
a Dow@@ ning Street talk told us that the text had probably come from Cam@@ er@@ ons &apos;s Choice office .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text of Cam@@ er@@ ons was delivered and there was no further immediate comments .
Adam lymp@@ ho@@ ever was threatened by the exclusion from English team , but it is still difficult
to Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if one has chosen the K@@ ader , the UK for the tour , is a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test day defeat not on my map .
I wouldn &apos;t exclu@@ de one down@@ wards victory .
Al@@ ast@@ air C@@ ooks Casino may be less experienced than those three years ago , but there is good spin @-@ players in the Batt@@ ing area , and the joint is powerful ; it will not wear sc@@ ars of 2012 , only one you@@ thful positive outlook .
with the ball , Mo@@ een is designed as a spin @-@ bowling and A@@ DI@@ L Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown size on test level , is an option for the attack .
related news : Adam L@@ th is leaving from the UK test model and is replaced by Alex Hal@@ es .
the decision to make Adam L@@ th , of course , is to be heavy for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire .
during his seven test , there was two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that Cri@@ ck@@ et@@ ters are alig@@ ned on the results .
there was no problem in question with Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , since - and I said this to it - player their own best selection shots .
before long time I have prolonged the course of Ly@@ th , but he had his own dest@@ iny of his own fate .
if he hop@@ efully come in Yor@@ k@@ shire for a further chance , a further chance will be .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss gave its position , even if he did not so good performance , and he is not surprised me ; he is mainly a team of team .
the question , how much time has a test with a test man receives , to be his sign , is difficult .
Ly@@ th received seven chances of play - and Sam Rob@@ son got ahead of him during Nick Comp@@ ton nine .
only Comp@@ ton received the opportunity to start home and down@@ wards .
the only for@@ ging that one can collect , was that England used first Jonathan rebellion in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex Hal@@ es come in , and he is a wh@@ ipped when I depos@@ ited high .
he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket which we saw in Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he posted 236 with us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he must have at least the same chances as they received before it , but this depends of course a team representation in the United Arab Emirates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea of which Mo@@ een is supposed to cook along by Cook , which would get an additional spin @-@ free bowling and four H@@ icks are going up , and I found nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a h@@ itting there could not strike , and this left @-@ ban@@ ker has already shown that he is a Teu@@ fel@@ sk@@ er@@ l of Cri@@ cket players .
Mo@@ een has not done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but is he a number 3 for her , and there &apos;s no great difference .
my previous team @-@ mate Justice Just@@ in Lang@@ er played his first 38 tests at the First Drop , before he appeared as an Op@@ ener in 2001 .
he has made three hundred races and looked back down .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari is afar off to the C@@ ader as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited way he impressed me very much .
people may see its statistics - on average 31 with a ra@@ cket and 35 with the ball - and thinking , it is a p@@ unt , but there is no large number of backup fl@@ ot@@ ers that rise up their hands and the train@@ ers have chosen for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team , England made a few special additions to the train@@ ers .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ a , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , became an advisor for the testing games could be a master score .
he is one of the most nic@@ est fel@@ lows of the game that will bring a wealth of experiences that he played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood is preparing for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful use into the setup .
I always felt that he &apos;s created for the international Cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela has he insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can be fresh in the cabin camper fresh wind , even if the news is in line with the previous year .
coll@@ ys team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , will not be used on the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot a similar rest against Australia and I have no problem for my part .
although , some will not agree , but Co@@ aches and team leader not determine the schedule .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and you must remember that as in the players rely on their jobs from their jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
such decisions are not made light of their heart .
the Bre@@ x@@ it stock ( Bre@@ x@@ it = export to Britain &apos;s from the EU ) might be increased to Zul@@ u , if the economy is in a fleet by 2017
David Cameron triggered a new hand@@ ler strategy to hold Britain in the EU , where it happen every day deep in trouble , even without the election of &quot; Jeremy Hill &quot; Is it Yes or no ? &quot; cor@@ by@@ n to the leaders of Labour or Tu@@ c , who came to Europe on Tuesday through Europe .
foreigners , also have her Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ acy , however , said that some member states , as deeply ent@@ an@@ gled in different cr@@ ises , as the EU is now once and has not always had their own fault with separated conc@@ essions and mal@@ ign@@ iting the contractual relationship , which they are generally not satisfied , were satisfied .
in Brigh@@ ton , the Tu@@ c decided at its annual meeting that it &apos;s not like it , if it &apos;s dangerous to social protection .
we could also call Dave and Georges Ber@@ l@@ ie agenda .
Prime Minister and finance ministers discuss the summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capit@@ als make a photo of itself from a famous local monument , with or without any local sizes , come home and say that she sought the allies .
it &apos;s always about me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my European friend , who wishes to conf@@ use the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Britain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inside of the EU , tells us that more and more short @-@ term minister and officials in some major cities are come up to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter whether we remain or go . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany carefully owned Chancellor Angela Merkel is a ally but it has been in power for 10 years before it looks so bad for them as it looks so bad for the ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated like Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
France &apos;s François Hollande can look back on his re @-@ election or its creation in 2017 .
he is also a b@@ lowing force .
Poland may soon a nation@@ alistic government , Spain but left one left .
it falls heavily , that they will out@@ line up a b@@ ison to help to avoid the sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ British how to prevent energy from the UK should take the outcome of separ@@ at@@ ist tend@@ encies taken out of the UK - having anything like most of the separ@@ at@@ ist tend@@ encies .
that is why some such ministers also invol@@ ve some helpful remarks , especially in SN@@ P &apos;s style , while Britain &apos;s Speaker campaign in 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , probably my friend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the re@@ trial was a ple@@ dge &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Britain has won nothing from the re@@ acts &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europeans know how to raise the Fle@@ et Street to its costs and which the anti @-@ sc@@ ep@@ tics of the press bar@@ ies is how it inspired when it inspired by Tony Ben@@ n who inspired it in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
it is very weak to Boris Johnson who remember the copper @-@ Euro Opportun@@ ists who made himself a name as an &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels @-@ correspon@@ dent in the early 90 @-@ he years .

in addition , the Med@@ ley gained tax @-@ advoc@@ ate barri@@ ers , telephone @-@ h@@ ack@@ ing foreigners and the pseud@@ o non @-@ in@@ kers , who possess most of our large newspapers .
actually Tony Bl@@ air was similar to her , but noted that if you s@@ itt@@ ens with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , one can be better ban@@ anas to raise him instead of having dinner and dinner .
in fact , Mil@@ i@@ band was opposed to Bl@@ air himself as Bl@@ air himself had conflic@@ ting , as Bl@@ air had demanded the principle of EU &apos;s Constitution , rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 which opened it a back@@ door .
the press has never gone .
but the nice Jeremy Med@@ in@@ n , who gave me a friendly Kl@@ ap@@ se on the back at Monday in Westminster , told him that he could no longer want more time for me - appears in danger , anti Kin@@ no@@ cks Bo@@ boy@@ cott , a strategy of the 80 @-@ year @-@ old , an error then and today .
it can take it but he must develop a coh@@ er@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ sofa has left me on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ &apos;s official position to Europe is - I press the target of - in development .

well , most people outside U@@ k@@ ip &apos;s traditional blu@@ ish foam tend@@ ency and the wild Ge@@ ograph@@ ers of Tor@@ ies Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism may well say everyone to say Yes .
it is what Hil@@ ary said , &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Ben@@ n@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n &apos; on radio and TV this week , she did not ad@@ mit that Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s appointment of the prov@@ oked John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell designed a bad idea .
it remin@@ ded me of the 70 @-@ ies , when his old father was trying to v@@ ile @-@ lo@@ yal to his Labour cabinet near his Labour Party , without losing his person with his cabinet .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys struggle was still more attractive .
but to fight to &quot; stay &quot; under any circumstances - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell spoke , nor what J@@ C told his fellow @-@ fighting against all the reports on Monday evening .
what also wants to mediate on the thr@@ ott@@ le Bott@@ om @-@ Up Image from Cor@@ by@@ n - remember that it even has touched me - news discipline will remain important at the clock in the age of TV around the clock , and above all in the Deser@@ ts of the Social Media , a breeding ground by Par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
it &apos;s right to give Cameron no Free Card for Europe , which allows him to keep on Lab@@ ours support in the tool@@ ing campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said .
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins re@@ think so sure .
but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns basic amb@@ itions for EU membership - consistent with her ben@@ ite recovery industry , its anti @-@ capitalist style - is not just a question of the es@@ ot@@ eric discussion of the left dis@@ sidents , for which the Nar@@ cis@@ si@@ sm@@ us of the minor part of dog@@ matic disputes shall be .
as with its lack of commitment to Nato or Tom Wat@@ son , J@@ C will not be convinced that J@@ C will no campaign to be with@@ held - if foreign diplom@@ ats are obliged to try to find in everything a sense of their su@@ peri@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin implement political capital , - they also have a bl@@ au@@ sible elec@@ torate so to make conc@@ essions to the British if this will be point@@ less for this ?
the United States are already disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction by the T@@ ory government on power , which I remembered on Monday &apos;s Monday , which was called the British Influ@@ ence Security Forum .
experts crit@@ ici@@ ze Report of Public Health England via E @-@ cigarettes
alleg@@ ations of a state @-@ funded agency that , e @-@ cigarettes are less dam@@ aging than smoking a meeting of 12 people , some with links to the tobacco industry , researchers examined .
experts that are writing in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined the Lanc@@ et with their help applying the public health England ( p@@ he ) in her report about e @-@ cigarettes .
P@@ he published the &quot; Basic sales report &quot; last month , and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot;
however , some researchers have asked the res@@ il@@ ience of the data content and agreed on the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an editorial team in the medical journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lanc@@ et last month laid the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ arily short grounds &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; based on the conclusion of his most important conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; two more researchers have asked BM@@ J and asked whether the claim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on stone or sand are established &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ een , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene , and Tropical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor for Clinical Ep@@ ide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on efficacy . &quot;
they said that the public expects the claim that &quot; the current estimate is that &quot; the present estimate is that e @-@ cigarettes are approximately 95 % less dam@@ aging than smoking &quot; on a detailed review of rep@@ lica and modelling .
in fact , this statement from a single meeting of 12 people who were sum@@ mon@@ ed to develop a model for multiple Crit@@ eria Decision Analysis ( MC@@ DA ) , in order to define their opinions about the defects of various nicotine @-@ hal@@ er products ; the results of this meeting were reported in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ een and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting is a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director was to obtain British Tob@@ acco means ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also wrote the references of BA@@ T on Public Health in a Sustainability Report , saying it .
one of the 12 participants agreed to obtain the means of an e @-@ cigarettes case , but not the financing that he should have received after reports before Mr. Philip Morris International to reports .
the reasons for selecting the members of the Gre@@ y@@ Centre will not be delivered , but also includes several known E @-@ cigarettes @-@ Champions , some of which also specify a sector financing in the paper .
some other participants in this session are not known for their know @-@ how in championship control .
the 1st edition of the tugs took part in the meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the research work in the group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; considers identi@@ fiable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most products , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mc@@ K@@ een and Cap@@ e@@ well &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , none of these connections or restrictions are discussed in the customer &apos;s report .
Mc@@ K@@ een and Cap@@ e@@ well said that the accus@@ ations of P@@ he said they &quot; there have no evidence that there was no smoking cigarettes as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smo@@ kers . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , director of health and well @-@ being at P@@ he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said re@@ acts to the claims of BM@@ J in advance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ cigarettes are considerably less dam@@ aging than smoking &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ kers die at its ad@@ diction .
all evidence suggests that health risks of E @-@ cigarettes are small compared to it but that we continue to study the long @-@ term impact .
it has unique duty to make the public about what is evidence of evidence and what , if it does not , especially if it gives around public confusion about the relative haz@@ ards in comparison to tobacco .
almost 80,000 people die annually in a disease with regard to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health system two billion £ per year .
by clear evidence of current evidence that e @-@ cigarettes are not without risk , but only a fra@@ ction of damage caused by the smoking that we will comply with our national competence .
BBC should un@@ cover East@@ poin@@ ter , &apos; former head of Channel 4
the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson said has said that the BBC should stop using programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial rival , would give her right arm , &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the radio charge should only be used to account the type of programs which are not sent by other UK broadcast stations .
he critic@@ ized the BBC to have public legal programs which may probably be seen from a smaller au@@ dien@@ ces to place the most popular shows of their Riv@@ age and streams like B@@ BC@@ 4 .
after the BBC @-@ General Director , Tony Hall , said the company promp@@ ted more in partnership with other organisations , Johnson said that he tried to come into contact with Channel 4 for six years while still trying to get into contact with BBC 4 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that the BBC programs are on job or sends it also clearly not sub@@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said in the top of his research on the future of BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to keep the round@@ trip , which I hold in @-@ term or long term for good idea , one should at least do its production at least for programs , which others do not or be commissioned .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window because they want to achieve a possible support for the future .
the idea that no one would show it is a joke , it &apos;s ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous , it is of course non@@ sense .
Johnson said : &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive control programs is financed without subsidi@@ zation of subsi@@ dies .
the Voice is a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , clu@@ ster@@ ed , both self @-@ productions .
hon@@ est@@ ly , other channels would give their right arm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m trying to see how this public @-@ public television . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t think that this was to decrease the BBC .
Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for vend@@ ors , in Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC bl@@ ame on the hunt for reviews was &quot; because of the amb@@ itions of people who work there , and because they believe that this is the best way to safegu@@ ard long term support . &quot;
his comments on the most popular shows of the BBC will provide up again , which was the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ el@@ gart speech in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC should sell the BBC shows as East@@ poin@@ ter .
Johnson said that the more publicly @-@ legal niche programs &quot; go to B@@ BC@@ 4 , although they can &apos;t measure the audience , but they are constantly argu@@ ing when they are going to run into their seem@@ ingly holy missions to just@@ ify a £ 4 billion broadcast fees . &quot; now , of course , we have created all these ob@@ sc@@ ulpt@@ ors programs that nobody has seen . &quot;
they put them into a time window in which nobody wanted to see her .
for the radio fee Johnson said the Committee : &quot; I encourage you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system regarding conditions those who can get the best value in this .
of course , you think all , think we get a great value for 150 £ per year , but for people who for the 150 £ a lot of money , ask me whether that is true , because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC .
the former Sky@@ Interface and Channel 5 CEO David El@@ stein , who also testified before the Committee on Tuesday , asked that the BBC will review their secret mission in order to provide , forming and to maintain . &quot;
he said that only little of the BBC &apos;s production would now be officially classified as education , saying that it would be 1 % of its TV production and 0,1 % in radio , and it should be doing this in &quot; inform yourself in &quot; and maintain . &quot;
on the question of partnerships , El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like those of the pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a hand@@ ful of TV must be shown and with the commercial fre@@ aders are making possible to make everything online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ ogen@@ etics &apos; can control brain cell by sound waves
this video shows how to change the Nem@@ at@@ odes , change in the direction , where it will sound with Sonic 2 sound lines .
scientists have tested that wor@@ ms with genet@@ ically modified nervous system that can be controlled from b@@ umps of sound waves .
the tiny n@@ em@@ at@@ odes , change in the moment , in which they have sound fig@@ s , that have to be heard for human ear with high frequencies to be heard .
im@@ pulses are done by switching engines of mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells , to be genet@@ ically modified to react to ultr@@ as@@ ound sensors .
added to this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers spoke , the wor@@ ms showed the power of a new method , called Son@@ ogen@@ etics to be used in ultr@@ as@@ ound to enable a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Srebrenica at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , told the Guardian that the method of one day could substitute the depths of brain , an inv@@ asive process that gives electrical im@@ pet@@ us into the brain of Park@@ inson &apos;s disease .
the cl@@ em@@ at@@ odes are not react on ultr@@ as@@ ound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani presented it , that they did it when it surrounded by a fluid with micro@@ scop@@ ic air bub@@ bles .
the bub@@ bles , he found out , intensi@@ fy the ultrasonic waves , which penet@@ rate into the wor@@ ms .
the enhanced ultr@@ as@@ ound sensors operate on structures that are called by TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ channels and can be found in membran@@ es with some of the babies .
the sound waves , the opening of these audio channels and activ@@ ates the cells , which they are assigned , thus a report of Nature Com@@ min@@ ications .
to create ultr@@ as@@ ound @-@ controlled Nem@@ at@@ odes , Gen@@ as@@ ani genet@@ ically modified the wor@@ ms that some of their Mot@@ on@@ ov@@ ones TR@@ P @-@ 4 can carry channels .
when he as@@ ound an ultr@@ as@@ ound in changed creatures , the sound waves are bol@@ ted through the micro@@ bl@@ ers and transferred to the wor@@ ms where they switch the changed engine @-@ on engines .
the procedure has some simil@@ ar@@ ities with Op@@ to@@ genet@@ ics , a ground@@ breaking tool to autom@@ ate neur@@ ons with the im@@ pulses of light .
but chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ bi@@ al could have some advantages over this technology .
in contrast to light , that needs to be lower in a optical fiber to the desired place in the brain , low @-@ frequency ultrasonic heat dropped , and may thus be sent into the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; we believe that treat gen@@ res and a therapeutic virus it is possible to trans@@ form the human neur@@ ons in a clinical outcome for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; said Hal@@ as@@ ani .
other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and ins@@ ulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

eight golden rules for the life of residence halls
eleven years ago I moved to a student residence at a residence , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral re@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the sm@@ all@@ most smile of those that I have handled - and many , long @-@ time complaints about others .
most of what I have learned is dist@@ illed in eight simple rules .
the entrance in a student residence is from very easy to hand up to an absolute sc@@ ary .
it is surprising about ch@@ att@@ ing : people tell whence com@@ est , whether and where you are called T@@ m@@ ite , and why you don &apos;t love to hate Mar@@ m@@ ite but in my heart , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract h@@ ah@@ aha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
bre@@ athe through it .
and help others to do the same - See questions and show interest .
it guides the conversation and helps you to find out human beings , which you like to speak with whom you would not speak , even when your eyelashes were burning in fire and that fire extingu@@ ishers would be .
let people leave people .
the rooms of people are often walking in drinks @-@ recipes , film @-@ night event locations and municipal meet , but they also have the places where people put on and under@@ wear their under@@ wear .
related to this : do not think of inter@@ acting at the University with a relationship
introduction received a rough treatment at the university .
your room should be a fug@@ ium , but a lot of students form a room @-@ to @-@ room bo@@ um@@ b culture , which can lead to life and soci@@ ally to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be the hell for someone looking for to recover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nothing in the culture allows you to tell you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I like you , and I want to go away our friendship , but you must go back to the energy that I have consumed for the interaction with you &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
attempt to feel when a mil@@ itia of soci@@ al@@ izing is exhau@@ sted - and send SMS instead of t@@ aps .
A@@ pro@@ po@@ s kno@@ ck : do it .
a guy in my students of residence had the idea that a non @-@ sealed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
close to baking .
as you begin the university on the cli@@ max of back @-@ Man@@ y , the Hammer@@ ing begins in the doors of the people in order to welcome you with a plate full of Brow@@ ni@@ es , less surprising than the welcome of the 1950 @-@ s &apos; welcome in the neighborhood , I always smile , if I always ask you a few personal questions . &quot;
our home @-@ made tre@@ ats offer a good way to close friends .
your roommate feel oblig@@ ated to keep itself and will associate your face with a pleasant surprise at the end .
naturally it depends on whether you are a fixed b@@ aker .
bad cl@@ umps in flour , sugar and fat make people sleeping sleeping when you kno@@ ck down .
food to steal , are an international crime in student residence .
of course , if the reserve is a theft , but is it possible to take a drops of m@@ ould for your tea ?
check it with the milk proper .
the od@@ ds are good that they say to himself , even when to cook in their interior .
if anyone ste@@ als your things , is anno@@ ying , and you have my compassion , but try to deal with it as my fellow worker , added to their milk a r@@ ins@@ ing agent to pun@@ ish fur@@ y .
it now is in prison .
you should make no noise when people can hold off from sleep or work .
it is not just a man to be a competent person , but that you are in the tru@@ thful spirit of the pro@@ verb to the people , who are sitting in the glass .
a girl on my hall@@ way asked her neighbours , if he makes them something ready to put Dr@@ um &amp; Bass , because it had three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had an exam in the morning .
she responded to later music .
when she stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she left her neighbours . unfortunately she left their own music , shut her door shut down her door , and went down to her three @-@ hour test .
would it be no romantic , if your future wife could enter into the same student residence by chance ?
around the contrary , it would not be ab@@ dom@@ inal v@@ ehem@@ ently , if you have a person responsible for your future wife , they will take up again and then go to experience every day , and perhaps remember@@ ing her common friends ?
of course , the heart runs his own way - but if a hot runner is definitely not your future wife , try to speak at least , your under@@ wear a little reason .
in the exciting moment , in which you notice that someone has dis@@ closed his key in his non @-@ closed room , the border between a Ul@@ k and har@@ ass@@ ment , it appears to mark it .
a good draw is funny , but it takes only moments when it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
please make a valuable and am@@ using lesson on safety - but never swe@@ aring any@@ body room with t@@ ooth@@ paste and sh@@ ampoo .
close your door , and place your keys in a glass of water , which you will then enter into the freezer - but more will do their owners at the ceiling anymore .
tow@@ n@@ houses for refugees , single @-@ handed , Ger@@ ing@@ n@@ services
in the mid@@ enti@@ ous house Markus G@@ ild@@ ner builds the medieval town house for people who have not much money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need residence , but also the only ce@@ asing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mother and Ger@@ ling &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ll show how you can still build and build well today , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old .
thousands of refugees are in the housing market .
entrepren@@ eurs Markus G@@ ild@@ ner believes not to know how quickly sof@@ ter living space can be created : it builds in a project tow@@ n@@ houses for refugees .
Mr. G@@ ild@@ ner , many refugees are displac@@ ed to the H@@ ousing Market .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus G@@ ild@@ ner : the mass housing in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
for men remain in a great part here .
given the number of refugees , we need sufficient hab@@ itable in the next decades .
a completely ban@@ ales , multi @-@ storey terra@@ ced house is the solution .
G@@ ild@@ ner : a town house needs a least space .
it facilitates the integration .
this is different when people gets in dormitories .
each of the six homes , which are currently constructed in the pilot project consists of three units of three asylum seek@@ ers each .
each residential unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it may be that many refugees are saying that it is peace , I go back .
the houses can easily be converted into the respective requirements .
how high are the cost ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : the price of 160 m2 of living space per house is worth 184 000 euros without any land .
this is man@@ age@@ able .
the construction lasted 6 months .
that is appropriate .
does the construction work complicated their plans ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : I checked my project correctly .
it is particularly complicated . it &apos;s always the dro@@ pping d@@ amo@@ kl@@ es , speci@@ alis@@ ing in the navigation condition .
Gr@@ us@@ el@@ y .
it is still hanging in a row that takes three apartments in the tow@@ n@@ house , and takes at least three places .
only in cities is missing .
and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how have the inhabitants react to their terra@@ ced house project ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : there were those who accused me to create luxury for asylum seek@@ ers .
what is definitely not right .
but don &apos;t miss the competitors for affordable housing ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : for this reason , we &apos;ve had a building boom in Germany last five years , but the luxury apartments that can hardly can aff@@ ord themselves through .
my project used the message that normal people need living space .
not only refugees , but also the mother , or the Ger@@ ing@@ ed@@ it alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll show how you still can buy and build well today . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore it is about .

iOS 9 : how to retri@@ eve the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by clicking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it &apos;s ready , you will give the telephone the option to download and then install .
some are distur@@ b@@ ance after installation , because they receive an error message , which means the &quot; software update failed . &quot;
to get around the problem , users are advised to wait for either to wait until the ons@@ lau@@ ght or try to update to iTunes .
the phone itself leads you through the rest of the process .
this may not means limit@@ ing the del@@ etion of apps to create space , but Apple has made it possible through the closure of the update . as it will be easier to do this , if you need a special tool to er@@ ase apps , and then re@@ install it once the process is completed .
it &apos;s worth it to ensure that your mobile phone is charged during update or is located near a charging unit , so the battery is loaded .
if the load is too low , Apple is not recommended that the update will continue , as the telephone could lead on half the way and lead to a break@@ down of the updates .

it was sympath@@ y at first sight , when the wheel bal@@ un ahead of Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , who is currently conducting their specialized ophthalm@@ ology in general hospital and who wants to jump into practice in the year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in the back head that the m@@ iller could fit perfectly in this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel &apos;s rim and laugh@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; when it was time , I just ph@@ oned them . &quot;
the couple of Müller was the idea to continue our own practice at As@@ endorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity and constant contact to the patient are very attractive for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy of the repository comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll .
after conversion , the rooms will look modern .
we will offer more ultr@@ as@@ ound scans as well as long @-@ term and endurance athletes and need an office block more .

a total of 50,000 euros will get the m@@ iller in the framework of a sponsor@@ ship program from the county ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality of the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) .

about 2000 people were employed according to Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll every quarter of practice in the practice of rock faces in the North German average practice of some 500 .
in As@@ endorf , there is still another hom@@ onymous practice .
a positive effect of the field by Frank Müller : the chem@@ ist stays according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ rel@@ ausen in As@@ endorf .
if no successor has found , it would have gone too .
&quot; who visited the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ash &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , you also consider primarily in familiar faces : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the seven medical fac@@ ulty advis@@ es and the cleaning force of the rim . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with their addition there were a era in As@@ endorf , after all the medical profession is practi@@ ced there for 30 years .
&quot; at the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; the Ur@@ sel Dome was ra@@ ck@@ led .
a little rage felt this after the long time already .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we still live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and they will see many patients often , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Inter@@ ni@@ st@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
your husband adds : &quot; we have a 6000 square meter property . &quot;
&quot; so far I have pressed over my garden work and now it could be different . &quot;
furthermore , the pair has two grand@@ sons and travels .
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the border controls will be high also on our border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister of Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the inspec@@ tions on the Hungarian border will be fully set in parallel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it is clear that everyone who wants to put an asylum request is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Pro@@ visions and Security of Man stood in the fore@@ ground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it was clear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that it does not need clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the people must not know that we don &apos;t accept cross @-@ free migration flows , also not from the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border .
it needs a controlled procedure .
Croatia exam@@ ines the cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia ref@@ uses
the Croatian government previously informed that Slovenia wants to drive refugees to Austria and Germany in the direction of Austria and may well put cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees .
however , all of this did not see the Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ l@@ kö@@ nen Z@@ ni@@ bach in L@@ ai@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the concept of cor@@ rid@@ ors may &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely un@@ acceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rather , the monitoring of borders - especially in Hungary - intensi@@ fy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the border with Croatia is already heavily controlled as the outer limit of the Sch@@ engen area .
as the Minister of Minister , Sloven@@ es wants to un@@ lock his limits for refugees but not .
&quot; every EU member must fill his obligations , otherwise the system can &apos;t work , &quot; says Gy@@ ör@@ fer Z@@ ni@@ dar .
as the Croatian government announced that the first refugees had attempted to travel to Tuesday in Eastern cro@@ ati@@ a in the cross over the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id in order to avoid exp@@ el the registration .
at the same age of the Croatian police , the Croatian police stopped .
according to their local media , police vehicles with new refugees have since then been meeting in Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik .
this was a man@@ slaughter of Syrian and Afghanistan , among them numerous women and children .
perhaps the emergency service and the Red Cross are already in use .
over the next few days there will be some 4000 refugees , Interior Minister Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
in addition , buses from Pre@@ se@@ vo was about the Mac@@ ed@@ onian Serb Border , which so far had launched the Hungarian border to Croatia , referring to Croatian and Serbian media about Wednesday .
the government in Belgrade , however , con@@ stra@@ cted it was allowing people to adopt , certain routes : &quot; neither will we , nor let us do this , &quot; was it .
according to the media report , in the morning the first bus with around 50 refugees have arrived at the Serbian border town S@@ id , in the course of the day further buses were expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants had been around 500 kilometers away from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border by Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have heard of Hungary , so the police told us to come here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
this means that it actually might be said to ob@@ server in ob@@ servers that have already excav@@ ated in the Balk@@ ans countries Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a somewhat further west track .
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive opportunities for border control &quot;
Croatia &apos;s Internal Affairs , O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic argu@@ ed that his country would have been prepared appropriate plans for the event of a strong state of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he did not call him , but he pointed out that Croatia is a non @-@ Sch@@ engen group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive potential control &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you then conduct strict controls to qualify for membership in the Sch@@ engen Area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners embar@@ k on a good report that concerns the standard of border controls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the Hungarian border , some 300 refugees continue behind Hungarian border fence .
according to the media reports the past night on the border crossing Hor@@ g@@ os , who flew to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , reports .
according to Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings Hor@@ g@@ os and Bak@@ i Bre@@ g remains closed completely .
whether the remaining fug@@ es wish to travel to the Croatian border is still un@@ clear .
the Serbian Minister of War Neb@@ oj@@ sa Stef@@ anovic had attempted to calm on Wednesday early in a local eye clinic in Hor@@ g@@ os : he will hold the debate about the Alternative of refugees , after the Hungarian border is now closed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would currently not have a very high refugee . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you could not say , whether they would continue their trip to Hungary , Croatia , or other country .
hel@@ per , migrants at - dangerous and Alternative trials
however , private and Hungarian workers have already begun to distribute the refugees maps , which alternative routes operated by Croatia on which alternative routes are set up by Croatia .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not safe : in parts of the border area there are even 20 years after the end of the conflict still not cleared min@@ e@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police informed that a team of mine swe@@ at was sent in the border region .

F@@ ed@@ Ex @-@ result mixed , financial prospects for 2016
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports a dis@@ appointing results for the last quarter , and the lie@@ fer @-@ giant had a full year due to a weaker demand for cargo services and higher costs associated with goods transport services .
the company also said that she is planning to start the holiday about 55@@ .000 seasonal workers for the holiday .
at that time , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company wants to set 50,000 employees for the holiday season .
the share came to more than 2.5 percent in the press market and 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. offered a profit of $ 10.@@ 40 and $ 10,@@ 90 in fiscal year ending in May , which ends 20 cents less than in previous forecast .
anal@@ ysts expected in a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10,@@ 84 $ .
the lower views are despite the price increases , which are at an average 4.9 percent , and on January 4 will be effective , despite higher supplements for heavy and large packages that will be collected from November .
the company said that the company intends to boost the earnings before the previous year due to cost reduction , higher income and due to growth in the online shops .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith states that the company demonstrates a solid balance when you are getting weaker as expected economic conditions , especially in production and global@@ ized trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plans for vacation jobs were announced a day later than that of a rival UPS that is planning to create 9@@ 0,000 - 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , roughly the same number as last year .
in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex has served $ 6@@ 92 million , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share stood at 2,@@ 42 $ per share , just behind the 2,@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve from C@@ ame Investment Research asked anal@@ ysts pre@@ di@@ ct .
net sales increased 5 percent to 12.4 billion $ .
six of Z@@ acks anticipated expected to amount to $ 12,@@ 23 billion .
in recent years F@@ ed@@ Ex has set a decline in international ranking shipping , which he made pro@@ stag@@ n@@ ating sales in his unit Express Shipping .
but the boom in the online shopping is increased its results by F@@ ed@@ Ex .
in the last quarter sales of the road @-@ transport rose by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat for higher cost of major packages and self @-@ insurance .
the express unit had increased revenue , due to higher prices , while earnings were sunk in the cargo business due to higher prices .
in the pre@@ market trading , approximately one hour before opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares fell by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,15 $ .
on Tuesday they had 11 percent losses for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
on the most expected meeting in the years , Federal Reserve Strat@@ ec will spend two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot to Honduras @-@ Mah@@ og@@ any table to decide whether it is time for the first time ever since almost a decade .
threat@@ en@@ ingly about them at the end of the ench@@ anted , double @-@ storey con@@ vivi@@ al sitting is a mur@@ al of the United States .
the card is a reminder that the F@@ ed President Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues want to set the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the Central Bank has a double order from the Congress : maxim@@ ize US employment and prices are stable here .
but since the great recession the F@@ ed leader has acknowledged that there is an un@@ forgotten third mandate ; financial stability .
and this third mandate , may be the X @-@ factor in a decision to make it pre@@ diction ; it will be announced on Thursday , whether the US economy is ready to be used by un@@ ri@@ val@@ ed inc@@ enti@@ ve by the close to zero @-@ short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most data of the economy show that it grows solid , the latest Tur@@ bul@@ ence on global financial markets promp@@ ted the previously agreed F@@ ed representative , these flo@@ at@@ ility by raising the interest rate for government bonds - and be it only around a quarter percentage point .
&quot; obviously the labour market and inflation are primarily possibly the most important thing to observe , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , Head of Staff at Mak@@ ler@@ son Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think , if they were looking for a pre@@ text to increase interest rate , higher reliability around the global market is enough just@@ ification , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no con@@ sen@@ sus about what the F@@ ed will do , sec@@ ures up in itself the financial market .
about half of the econom@@ ists recently reported by Bloom@@ berg , have a french @-@ rate hike this week .
however , the financial markets are a shut@@ down of the F@@ ed with a key indicator that shows a 30 % chance to increase an increase .
this indicates a decline in the German market , if the F@@ ed increases the proposition , unless they are strateg@@ ist the blow in allowing them to promise a further increase far away .
the Dow Jones Industrial Average value rose by 2@@ 28.@@ 89 points or increase of 1.4 % to 16.@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 on Tuesday .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed Policy maintained the sentence in this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Chief econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the sentences to that date , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if she does it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should she need to go well into its explanation in order to calm the financial markets , lest they fall into pan@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argu@@ ed that a french @-@ rate hike would become a post @-@ rate hike and it would eliminate un@@ certainty when the F@@ ed will act .
one month ago , the F@@ ed appeared on a good way to increase the sentence by 0.25 percentage points to this month , the first small step in a slow deep@@ ening of mon@@ ary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the United States .
in spring and early summer , Y@@ ellen were already told that despite the symptoms of liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be needed , an increase in the proposition .
though the creation of work places slow@@ ed in August , the improvement on the labour market was slow@@ ed solid .
the unemployment rate declined to 5.1 % in the past month , the lowest since more than seven years and near the levels that the F@@ ed looks as full @-@ time employment .
wage increases have been shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation was constantly under the average of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representative said that the primary lack is a significantly lower cost of oil prices .
the economy &quot; can handle higher interest rates and / need them due to the pre@@ tension in the labour market , &quot; said Ian , bl@@ son , Managing Director at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ bi@@ ans .
but the financial markets around the whole world assembled the end of the last month after China had dev@@ ot@@ ated its currency .
the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped more than 16 % of its peak in May , when investors feared that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would like to influence global growth .
the market has recovered somewhat at this month , the Dow has dropped by nearly 10 % below the H@@ och of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives influence market tur@@ mo@@ il impact the complex calculation , when to raise interest rates .
&quot; if the events were not in the financial markets and news on the weakness of Chinese economy in the past few weeks would not have occurred in this meeting , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ lin@@ ers , Senior Research Fel@@ low at the U@@ CL@@ A C@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US music database .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now he tells us that they will wait at least one month to get the effects better in their hand . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there &apos;s a lot of un@@ certainty on what the impact on the US economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ lin@@ ers .
the health of the world economy is none of the main activities , therefore it should not be involved at its decision @-@ making .
but , however , the planet has become the F@@ ed Monetary policy of the world .
the influence of the Central Bank has been enormous throughout the last years .
the mere hint of the time manager Ben S. Bern@@ anke , in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could make her mon@@ et@@ ical expansion , &quot; could make confusion around the globe .
in a world , in which markets and economies are increasingly being negoti@@ ated , a F@@ ed representative can not only monitor the developments in other areas , but also advis@@ ing to advice the developments in other areas , but also to obtain a better understanding of global economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her decision @-@ making is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more art as science , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management in the company En@@ vest@@ net Inc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jeffrey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond , VA . , observed that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of inter@@ actions on financial market movements , apparently not linked with the economic fundament@@ ally data . &quot;
L@@ acker , a legitim@@ ate member of the Federal Open Market Committee , made a interest @-@ rate hike and quoted decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce their Leit@@ z by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three meetings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite limit@@ ing recogni@@ z@@ able effects on growth in the US , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ acker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one year later , the F@@ ed @-@ Represent@@ atives made this ret@@ ali@@ ation .
the F@@ ed should only place the aspects of financial stability only during a severe economic crisis , such as market roll@@ back in 2008 , said Adam S. Pos@@ en , a former member of the Committee of interest income of the Bank of England .
the most recent tur@@ mo@@ il come not close to this plane , he said .
&quot; surely she will not fall into the situation in which she feared the interest of interest , because the markets slow@@ ing down , &quot; said pos@@ es , President of Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the Federal Reserve Act always contains the double Mand@@ ate and did not mention the financial stability , and until it becomes their think I would not think that it would advance the time .

Brazil &apos;s pe@@ diat@@ ric company Rio Grande does nutrition for healthy feeding
the Brazilian pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric organisation SP@@ RS tried to clari@@ fy women on sho@@ cking , how important good nutrition is during the saving time . you do this with the presentation of pictures from babies that are painted to breasts that stri@@ ves to un@@ healthy food .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates , the babies that give up all nutrients you need to comp@@ ile a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers has come to increase their daily calories by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research results indicate that a higher cal@@ ory consumption is not the only di@@ et@@ etic update to have mothers .
a current study under the management of Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet tend to affect the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours .
unfortunately , a healthy diet of the child could negative the immune system negative .
excep@@ tions for the new Bern@@ rie@@ der Sports Hall
the Municipal Council of Bern@@ ar authorized the construction entry for the 2,3 million Euro @-@ expensive sports hall .
and he did an exception .
the roof can be fl@@ atter for solar installation .
the planning for the long desired turn@@ table arrangement on the Bern@@ rie@@ der sports grounds come step by step forward : in the latest Municipal meeting , the worked construction work without large discussions was blessed .
prior to this , the board had decided on an application for &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; from the valid development plan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was permission for a special form on the roof construction &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore a &quot; saddle ru@@ d@@ ach with non @-@ core tip and roof top was to be built . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; background planning is the scheduled use of the roof@@ top floor space for solar systems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus we get a wonderful great al@@ dd@@ ach &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in this session . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the &quot; Liberation , &quot; it was necessary to en@@ compass the roof of the roof that means of energet@@ ic reasons - differently than in the development plan - below ten degrees .
the volume of the hall is reduced significantly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan measures any &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; til@@ ted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - whereby the Bern@@ rie@@ der municipality usually has restri@@ c@@ tive to the exemp@@ tion of the exemp@@ tion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are no recur@@ ring project in the gym : &quot; we will not create a preced@@ ence , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger .
the hall@@ u@@ ation of the sports centre is a community project of the municipality and of SV Bern@@ ried .
the costs have calculated approximately 2.3 million euros .
sub@@ sid@@ y are expected from school and meteor@@ ite boo@@ kl@@ ing .
in the next proce@@ eding , the building supplement for the 18 x 36 meter hall should now be presented to the Council of the land@@ lord .

currently , there are a short @-@ term maintenance of Car@@ itas and a hired psychiat@@ ry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened does not happen that such an opportunity may not return again &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Fischer said about the Qu@@ asi , to the Le@@ ch , who had been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and very comprehen@@ sion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have not been a true perspective for the house , in which Fischer has been working as head for over 30 years , has not given it .
he was asked to take over from Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take the post of the medical director .

refugees need accommodations : study War@@ ns Restaurant
the location in the German housing market is stra@@ ined .
also more refugees seek a paid stay .
the pressure on the pension market is growing .
the social housing is faced with a challenge .
the distribution of distribution in the German residential market has long since begun .
with the upcoming refugees and unemployed persons from the EU , more people are increasingly over@@ loaded on a market , which is now over@@ loaded in many large cities .
they are competing with welcome gu@@ ar@@ ders around the last affordable housing .
to cover the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units have to be built until 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this result is a study on the order of the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social housing construction &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for comparison , 26@@ 0,000 units have been finished in Germany this year .
there are 14@@ 0,000 apartments in total .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees are not obliged to live as an asylum seek@@ ers in a initial public accommodation .
many blow the housing market and rows in the long qu@@ eu@@ es outside the rental apartments .
however , according to the Federal Office of the Federal Office , less than half of all the seek@@ ers was rent last year .
the negative development of the economy is not only increasing the rising of the population .
the study also showed significant meetings in the country &apos;s housing policy in the last years .
Germany remains a housing for housing that will increase from year to year .
at present , Matthias Günther , author of the study , compl@@ ains about 77@@ 0,000 units of metrop@@ olitan areas , Matthias Günther referred to the study .
so many working persons lived in large cities , particularly in WG @-@ rooms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; young adults remained in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; left of the fl@@ au@@ te on the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in large cities the number of the square metres per capita has declined again in the past years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order to solve the problem the Alliance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social housing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; proposes a re@@ boot . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new inc@@ en@@ tives to re@@ launch the social housing construction .
this may be wai@@ ved to the property tax and the property tax for subsi@@ dies will be suspended .
in addition , we are offering attractive tax @-@ help opportunities in accordance with an alliance .
the support program for Refu@@ gee H@@ ands in the state bank of Kf@@ W are already well maintained in cities and communities .

refugees have a free choice : Croatia and Slovenia cor@@ ridor
practically no one has been passing to Hungary , since more refugees live in the way about Croatia .
Zagreb announces the journey through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ dles .
ris@@ ky is still dangerous .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighboring land Slovenia about the establishment of a cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I spoke with the Sloven@@ ian interior minister , and if it is necessary we will organize a cor@@ ridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Croatian Interior Minister Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already a Sch@@ engen area .
the EU country Croatia is not a narrow land .
after the de@@ priv@@ ation of the Serbian Chinese border , hundreds of refugees have been broken to Croatia to get to Western Europe .
500 people arrive at the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , report about Croatian TV broad@@ caster RTL .
on the eve of Hungary , Hungary had v@@ eded its limit for refugees .
new laws , which entered into force on the same day , remains practically unnecessary for asylum procedures in Hungary .
Croatia wants to pass the refugees .
the Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Mil@@ anovic said : &quot; they can travel , and we are preparing for this way . &quot;
these people are there , women , children and men who want to live and reach something .
however , people are people who would not want to live in Croatia .
on the morning , the Croatian police seized the first refugees at the Serbian Republic of Serbia and Croatia .
most of the media reports were repor@@ tedly seen from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came both with bus and tax@@ is to the Serbian border of S@@ id .
immediately after their arrival , they had tried to return on foot to Croatia on the green border .
while the Croatian @-@ Serb border , the refugees St@@ airs not in the area .
there are other haz@@ ards in this regard : there are still sharp mines from the Yugoslav civil war in the nin@@ eties .
min@@ e@@ fields should now quickly create a secure passage .
after the end of Hungary , there are hardly more refugees according to the closure of the border .
this day the police dispos@@ ed of 366 days .
just before the end of the evening , there were still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws apply the over@@ coming and damage of the border to us as an off@@ ence .
in the southern Hungarian border of Sz@@ eg@@ ed , 35 cases were initiated .
the condemned building defects up to five years and the exp@@ ulsion from the country .
according to the immigration authority I picked up a total of 94 political asylum applications on Tuesday , in which almost all - 93 are on the main transition of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
the applicant are 13 families with small children and two older people .
40 refugees had still been in fighting there on Wednesday morning .
however , it has no more view to get granted asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after Hungarian view , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safe third country &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old political asylum seek@@ ers should get there being .
only a few hundred refugees came together before the &quot; Trans@@ itz@@ ring &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
workers began to emer@@ ge in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
they collected the gar@@ bage , which left tens of thousands of people in the road@@ side last weeks .
door gr@@ illes were discontinued and one of the recording camps were rebuilt in the limit locality .
towards the objective of this conversion no one wanted to express .
after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria reached a few refugees .
in addition , the country has intensi@@ fied its border control .
but about 20,000 migrants were transferred to government , but still in the country .
in Salzburg , about 1400 people are waiting for the drive to Germany .
the ferry traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning on assignment German authorities .
several groups of refugees met several groups in Freil@@ assing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; constructed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; above the border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were on Sunday with dreams , when ten people stood with rice gu@@ aters , at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wer@@ n@@ st@@ one mayor Alois Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists who were to visit with the train to Passau .
because on Sunday , because of the Refu@@ gee Council , which had been sur@@ prisingly unbe@@ atable by the traffic in Austria , was brought up for them in Wer@@ n@@ stein , who offered now his assistance and were mounted on the border with two other hel@@ pers and their cars on the border in Passau .
before we first met the un@@ mist@@ ress , with lunch and drink only .
we have got it right , we bring it to Passau with a car .
&quot; it was of course , &quot; said Stad@@ ler in O@@ Ö@@ N talk .
they were very grat@@ eful .
a man did not take it to give you a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire brig@@ ade .
&quot; it has pleased us well , &quot; says Stad@@ ler .
the up@@ take @-@ up train stations took place on Sunday evening in Wels from a ICE in a regional train in Passau , by the notice , that the rail traffic was stopped after Germany , but still could try more about the border .
however , the regional train was stopped at the Inn in Wer@@ n@@ stein on the river Inn .
in Wer@@ n@@ stein , the border crossing general is generally high in the course .
the bridge firm with the Bavarian neighbours takes place in Sunday , a two @-@ storey sporting events organised by the Union Wer@@ n@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
it was said that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án sends more of the thousand of them to be logical picture of a seem@@ ingly antic policy :
instead of precisely in the R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke camp at the erection of structures , our German Chancellor than@@ ked and publicly conf@@ essed , the attitude of the Hungarian government into the Dun@@ at@@ ile of National Soci@@ alism .
dead bodies of this policy are not only those Austrian who are now con@@ fron@@ ted in the districts of cha@@ otic distur@@ ban@@ ces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the poultry farmers will find that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prosp@@ ered country &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which they invited and welcomed , nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there will be a great challenge , given the ongoing refugee currents and the close relationship with us , we must manufacture &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; adequate states &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it will be still large - peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad on the search for 35,000 w@@ inter@@ ly qu@@ arti@@ berries
Konrad has to fulfil all hands with the Refu@@ gee Children .
Christian Konrad It was acc@@ ust@@ omed to have his Word to life .
the government has used a &quot; ra@@ w@@ ary &quot; Rai@@ ff@@ eisen Bank for thousands of refugees to set up t@@ quarters for thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the first record centre of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already arrived in the handle .
&quot; we have no hom@@ eless more in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported his first success .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday was no great economic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad and praised the organiz@@ ational &quot; master performance &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Interior Ministry spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ris@@ ky situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in total , Konrad presented a total of 85@@ .000 qu@@ int@@ ents in the hot year .
to achieve the number , 35,000 new accommodations must be found in the coming weeks - 20.000 are supposed to provide countries , 15,000 of the federal government .
if there are more refugees , we can do it .
&quot; but it is not a barrel without a floor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has led talks with the coun@@ tri@@ bun@@ es .
and they had assured him , too , too for the upcoming refugees Qu@@ arti@@ c .
&quot; in Upper Austria it is going well , &quot; he said Ferry Mai@@ er .
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ ala supports Konrad .
tomorrow it will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , thus shall be clari@@ fied as the Church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; great expectations of the right @-@ rack meets the ORF @-@ Action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hel@@ ds as we &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform the individuals can offer private individuals stra@@ ight@@ forward accommodation .
in addition , there is to be hotels vac@@ ated in the winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and Mai@@ er critic@@ ized the standards for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in case of emergency they could not be that arti@@ cul@@ ature must have to hold a certain height of the hand@@ tu@@ fts or the size of the upper position .
for a limited time , &quot; Emergency standards &quot; would need to apply .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contrary to the interior of the Interior , he is justified in ensuring his experience . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am an older Lord , whom we do not speak without further into the face . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
over@@ powers is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Mai@@ er did not cause any costs as they explained themselves .
they wish to increase their number of employees in three to four .
the own qu@@ arti@@ er@@ one has not been successful yet .
Konrad Z@@ wanted to arrange a container at the st@@ eph@@ an@@ splatz in office .
but there are obviously wrong problems .

se@@ eh@@ of@@ er : &quot; Bor@@ ders are not rub@@ ber@@ ed &quot;
in a extended telephone at the Bavarian prime minister Horst Se@@ eh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef Pl@@ inv@@ inger ( VP ) presented another pioneer in the refugee &apos;s demand .
Se@@ eh@@ of@@ er has covered me that the German borders are not rub@@ ble .
the res@@ ot@@ age of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany shall continue to say .
however , there is now the corresponding limits .
if you want to drive more refugees with refugees to Germany there will be no more .
however , the seek@@ ers will be brought into Germany with regular journeys .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; member stir@@ rer demanded more ampli@@ fied solidarity in the refugees demand by the other EU member states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; that now Austria will carry out again to its borders , is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logical episode &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the fore@@ head of the Germans &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next R@@ unt@@ astic is a question of time

&quot; in the IT , the very wise heads of our raw material - and we must attempt to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; D CEO Hannes D@@ haus@@ er .
he can imagine to invest in the new ship@@ yard from the New ship@@ yard , and later to search that too .
but from the beginning , S &amp; T wants to operate with the new neighbours - the one of which is quite promising : &quot; the next r@@ unt@@ astic is just a question of time . &quot;
between EUR 1.7 million euros were invested by S &amp; T in the facility , 3.3 million euros of the Tech@@ center , which is one @-@ third of the city of Linz , Upper Austria country and the federal government ( FF@@ G ) .
the building has been re @-@ examined by the Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T as well as the Tech@@ center .
30 % of 2700 square meters of residual area in the building are already rented , for a further 40 percent do it in@@ quiries .
L@@ ia @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ er opened second business of the arch@@ way
the focus will be on the Fur@@ la @-@ hand@@ bags in the new shop .
actually Jutta Bre@@ a wanted to settle a dog .
this project had to post@@ p@@ one the 49 @-@ year old project of L@@ ia Per@@ oni into the d@@ unge@@ on market of ar@@ cade : after all , it is now an increase in the form of another location .
in the Fur@@ la @-@ Shop , compared to the business , in which it sells bags , shoes and clothes of different manufacturers , the Fur@@ nit@@ ure Su@@ tra@@ cker is now available for ladies hand@@ bags of the Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets , starting from 75 Euro .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
several weeks were rebuilt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think that if I should open a store , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Bre@@ ite . &quot; &quot; &quot;
decisive for the decision was among others , that the Fur@@ la @-@ producers who are in home in Bologna , from the idea of an own site , where only their hand@@ bags were sold , done .
&quot; we are the only company in the Greater Linz , which have been selling this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters , who has Italian roots .
her fashion interest has been created Bre@@ ite by her mother in the cra@@ dle .
and , most , if it developed something and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why some wife answered in the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag in decoration , can also answer the schol@@ ar by last security .
maybe it &apos;s about how a beautiful bag is enhanced any out@@ fit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ etter from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pf@@ äl@@ zer ancest@@ or from Donald Tr@@ ump came out of a place whose inhabitants are called an@@ om@@ ors .
this property connects man@@ ders also with the million@@ aire , the US President wants to become .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for a good exc@@ it@@ ement .
if he sells his alien host@@ ility , journalists , or knowledge g@@ aps in international crisis politics . the candidate for the President of the French President is plan@@ ed to campaign for the election campaign .
and cuts out well .
this will also be registered in the p@@ fäl@@ ische K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate stor@@ am come .
the New York office with the F@@ öhn@@ fr@@ is@@ ur takes care of many in the wine village on the Wein@@ straße .
some of the 1200 @-@ inhabitants spot is related to sp@@ icy corners that is related to him .
his grand@@ father came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Palat@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in the election campaign .
the Zoo of St. Wendel St. Wendel shot a movie by Tr@@ ump .
and what do vill@@ agers think about his goal , become the most powerful man of the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that som@@ eh@@ ow find somewhat on the somewhat , but are not so deeply impressed by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Simone Wendel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ ish has made an am@@ am@@ ant documentary about the place and his famous offspring , alongside Tr@@ ump and the Heinz @-@ ket@@ ch@@ up family Heinz numbers .
Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes in the Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) also in word - so with this statement that it would certainly be successful if he would live in a whole city .
he did not bring it to the king of the hearts .
though respec@@ tiv@@ ating respect to the performance of the family , however , respec@@ t@@ ful the opinion that Tr@@ ump &quot; was quite a bit of a grand@@ child , &quot; says St. Wendel .
inci@@ d@@ ently , the nickn@@ ame , the k@@ all@@ round , in the circum@@ ference , &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ ary @-@ macher , &quot; to High @-@ German : the legisl@@ ature , says it .
Tr@@ ump is therefore from the village of the state .
the in@@ ump &apos; success story started in 1885 , when his grand@@ father immig@@ rant and opened in the US a place for gold dig@@ nit@@ aries .
foundation of the property company had first property purchases in New York .
but life of the parents was not clear from the tragedy , their wish to return to home in the home of the Bavarian State , where the Palat@@ inate was then .
he did not take tr@@ ump , because he was once approved without hom@@ ologation , was the Director of the Institute for for@@ gery and Ethno@@ graphy , Roland Paul , a film@@ start .
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ child of an &quot; illegal out@@ age &quot; .
this stand@@ ings in contrast to the not@@ ion listed below .
he had repeatedly called for Mexican immigrants in the United States and demanded the construction of a dam to d@@ eter illegal immigrants .
&quot; as the pol@@ led , is not so sympath@@ etic , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a remote cro@@ c f@@ umps ( &quot; The O@@ ma was a new@@ born Tr@@ ump , the Op@@ a was born Heinz &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hus@@ band@@ men who is reti@@ ring from the Americans , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is always such &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seven thousand &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
will he believe that Tr@@ ump occur ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never kissed himself in his hom@@ etown . &quot;
the pension commission is mentioned in Veron@@ ika Sch@@ ramm , and a desc@@ endant of the Heinz with a visit to the church organ ended , which came in general well .
&quot; this is why I can &apos;t think of the Donald , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you &apos;ll find it better if he won &apos;t want it , for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radi@@ al views , I don &apos;t know if it is good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had been at the time of his grand@@ father in the United States , had been like he would have never been there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ der Sarah Büh@@ ler .
and as President ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my President is not , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are sexually mature without the President Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
W@@ end@@ els film , which was inter@@ viewed for by Tr@@ ump , have seen 12 000 Kin@@ ds , including in the United States watches the interest .

the final three agree : Bachelor &apos;s Sam Wood is the perfect man - but whom will he choose ?
mystery revealed ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki might have possibly known un@@ aud@@ ited , who wins The Bachelor &apos;s .
the woman , at the Sam Wood in the Bachelor &apos;s style , got the largest intelligence covered in 2000 .
and none of the remaining dam@@ pers left is certainly not reas@@ on@@ ably priced , whether the one who has received last Rose .
but as we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows on the day before you checked , you might be given a hint on it , who will be the winner .
Sam Wood has sealed his lips to the final on Thursday
all three women have left over the spec@@ tra , why is the perfect man who is the perfect man and called his mind for hum@@ or , amb@@ ition , family values and positive attitude as reasons for why they like to want to be his partner .
however , if the question is asked &quot; If not you , who should get W@@ oods Last Rose ? , &quot; could her answers could be destroyed , who won the heart of the brook . &quot;
fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki did both quickly - apart from themselves - besides themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship between the first day .
&quot; from the moment that I went into house and ( sar@@ ah ) and SAM@@ S energies I felt that she felt that she felt pretty compatible , and I thought that in the whole course of the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows .
&quot; Sarah has his feet on Earth , making it much fun together with her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mark@@ os@@ ki . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have seen them together , and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that they were well suitable as a couple with Sam Wood as a couple .
from their point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that in the hom@@ est@@ or day , last week it became clear that there was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and the family , I was clear that this is not only a game - I am set up on him now , &quot; she said .
and when she was asked to choose Wood choose Wood with them , then she was bar@@ ren .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I love the remaining girls alike - it &apos;s a defin@@ ite decision between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor is broadcast@@ ed on ten on Wednesday , 7 : 30 .

Jar@@ r@@ yd Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL &apos;s career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the USA - and there were many other teams that sent out after his impressive open day training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and coach Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a very wise choice .
some trainer would prop@@ elled for the rest of the game on the bank when he had lost a rum@@ ble as he did as the Aus@@ sie @-@ Rug@@ by League con@@ jug@@ ate in its first P@@ unt return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minnesota .
but Tom@@ is@@ ula trusted in his husband and Hay@@ es the next opportunity to return a cas@@ ual return , and also in the running game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
in his opinion , Tom@@ s@@ ula showed his true face in the cabin camper .
instead of his R@@ ook@@ ies to the rest of the team , he encouraged them to grin@@ d them .
Tom@@ s@@ ula raises Hay@@ ne also public in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Sport@@ score cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team @-@ team Co@@ ordin@@ ator Thomas Mc@@ G@@ aug@@ he@@ y , who ri@@ mp@@ ed to kill his sm@@ ooth@@ ed catch and to take care of the next game .
Jar@@ r@@ yd Hay@@ ne is coated with a colored , who was restored in the first quarter of the Minnesota Vik@@ ings
it was certainly not the start to Hay@@ ne and its massive Australian tra@@ ce@@ ability for its N@@ FL @-@ debut .
Hay@@ ne left the game field following the F@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian Radio duo of Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy at 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he could not visu@@ alize in his N@@ FL career .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a thing that exists now , just for the next game , and it is , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ ne . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne commissioned the shar@@ pen@@ er with his Orig@@ in debut in 2007 , when a pass leading into his own in @-@ Go@@ al area at a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .

Google has an unusual personal approach to the dis@@ closure of the fund in his blog .
Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google staff , who have fled from Kabul , writes Rita Mas@@ oud , who was from Kabul , who was 7 years old and her personal experience .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many of our dark rail and bus trips belonged to our trip , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fri@@ ght , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but as the refugee and migrants had grown in Europe , many people look like my family des@@ per@@ ate after help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
donations go to four non @-@ profit organizations that provide support for refugees and migrants : doctors without fron@@ ti@@ ers , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google told that the first global donations collected up to a value of 5.5 million in goo@@ gle@@ .com / while the donations will be doubled to $ 11 million .
Europe is fron@@ ted with his worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has sold more than 4 million people this year .
many of them were murdered from the war in Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya .

for easily over@@ coming di@@ abet@@ ics , weight loss surgery can be helpful .
the advantages of weight loss surgery for easily exc@@ essive people with type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years .
it is still too early to say about whether , overweight people with diabetes in weight loss live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; death data require a long time to show something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of weight loss surgery , which wrote a report about the new study in j@@ ama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
weight loss @-@ loss sur@@ geri@@ es or adi@@ pos@@ itas surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s own ability to maintain food .
more than the years did the adi@@ pos@@ itas certification to treat type 2 diabetes as efficient , most studies were carried out in humans that were ill @-@ ob@@ ese of a Body Mass Index ( BMI ) of 35 or higher .
BMI , a certain measure of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24,@@ 9 .
a BMI of 25 or more shows that someone &apos;s overweight can be overweight and humans with a BMI above 30 are in ob@@ ese .
you can calculate your BMI : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
researchers from Taiwan , the researchers of Taiwan , researchers from Taiwan , which they have collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obes@@ ity - mag@@ uri@@ yp@@ ass and stomach tor@@ ch - for medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily verified .
the average BMI in which visitors are subjected to this operation decreased from 31 to 24@@ ,5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , the BMI in those who are non @-@ surgical treatment and treatment were approximately equal to 29 .
those of those who under@@ go a surgical procedure , lo@@ osed the disease @-@ disease in 36 % and partially at 28 % .
in the medi@@ cally @-@ treated group , the Diabetes has completely dissolved just by one percent , and in part with only about two percent .
in addition , the results of inspec@@ tions of the blood pressure , the tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de and the &quot; bad &quot; LD@@ L Chol@@ ester@@ ols , &quot; generally better in the &apos; surgical &quot; group , the authors found out .
the researchers also supervised the patient &apos;s blood @-@ blood c@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects blood glucose levels in the course of time .
ha@@ em@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , write the researchers .
after the operation the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level declined by about 9 percent to around 6 percent .
however , in the medical treatment group there remained stable at about 8 percent .
but these better &quot; gly@@ cem@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not decrease the mortality in five years , then the leading researcher Dr. Chi@@ an @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team looked like best results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ yp@@ ass surgery team had lost more weight compared to the gast@@ re@@ ec@@ tom@@ y Group ( 7.4 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) and reached greater dec@@ lines in weight ( 4@@ 6.9 % vs. 2.1 % ) and reported a complete over@@ coming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study shows no survival benefit of surgery after five years shows , there are indications of a trial which leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study it was subjected to ob@@ ese people who did not subjected to a Adi@@ pos@@ itas operation , roughly 29 per cent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group which tried conventional methods .
although the new study showed no advantage for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said , it was s@@ oo@@ thing for people with a BMI of 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of the study , because it says that this operation in this low BMI group is lower , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without an increased risk of death or a ren@@ al disease , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and her physi@@ cians should start to take weight as soon as the patient is with its BMI between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we wait for a long time until we &apos;re able to take this serious &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think that once these genetic changes have been accumulated since they are firmly connected to the body with obes@@ ity and diabetes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; &quot; &quot; Europe could not receive all refugees too , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama and added that the true solution for refugee crisis in the Middle East . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist leaders ur@@ ged refugees to end refugees in the local countries of refugees .
the Dalai Lama said the problem of the refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion in Oxford , which is devoted on eth@@ ics studies .
he demanded that the interests of humanity should be placed on the interests of the individual nations or even continents using the circumstances .
he emphas@@ ized that the response to the Western European countries spread to the refugee crisis , although the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech .
although the Dalai Lama visited Germany and Austria &apos;s effort to conquer the crisis , he stressed that there was only one temporary solution .
&quot; to take several thousand refugees too , is wonderful , but in the meantime you must think about long @-@ term solutions such as a real peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for those Muslim countries , &quot; he stressed .
ultimately we must think , as the killing is reduced in their countries .
we need to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violence has never solved these issues , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama said the problem of violence and commented on George &apos;s actions after the terrorist attack on September 11 and issued that the anti @-@ violent action of the USA moved on a chain of un@@ control@@ l@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my bid to President Bush , and I said to him , the way to a solution of this problem is in non@@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his moti@@ fs were good , but he sat down violence , and the f@@ ath@@ ering imp@@ aired &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four times increase of consumption of wall disinfection due to children in the past 4 years
Gi@@ ft@@ control centers in the United States inform about a nearly 400 percent increase in number of children under 12 years , which is strongly swal@@ lowed on non @-@ alcoholic beverages , which Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord L@@ op@@ ez , director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of disinfection expend@@ itu@@ res reported in children under 12 years of age , providing a control centres , from 3.@@ 266 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are getting more common to those products and unfortunately , a percentage of them go in the emergency recording , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ op@@ ez CNN . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that some of the sons of disinfect@@ ants remained stable while some do they work to im@@ press their friends , or because of a mut@@ ation during the social media .
videos on YouTube show how young disinfect@@ ant could only drink because of a budget experience .
young people have bl@@ os@@ edly mixed disinfect@@ ant with non @-@ alcoholic mou@@ th@@ wash to preserve a har@@ der drink .
younger children can be sp@@ itted by attractive sounds of disinfect@@ ant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ op@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the more attractive ( hand @-@ disinfect@@ ant ) are those that are par@@ ked .
there are disinfect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , wine trau@@ ben@@ - and or@@ ang@@ es , which are very appe@@ aling for children .
wall @-@ infection Ag@@ ents contain anywhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
particularly with infants may lead some shots for alcohol in@@ tox@@ ication .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; says Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the Gi@@ ft@@ Link Center at the University of Kansas , station Fox 4 in Kan@@ sa City .
so , you would not have a jo@@ ck whis@@ ky cause , but people leave this hand @-@ disinfect@@ ant within reach of children , and if children get it , then it &apos;s a quick way to consume much alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ ja Russell , a six year old girl who recently taken four sy@@ ringe after the straw@@ berry shower in the school , was taken in a emergency recording .
her blood alcohol therapy was 179 , twice higher than the threshold that applies to an adult in law , said Dr. Chris R@@ it@@ ch@@ ey , a not@@ ation doctor who treated them at the G@@ tiny Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ ja l@@ ame her words and was not able to go about when they arrived in the emergency .
physi@@ o@@ vers@@ aw the night in a separate children &apos;s hospital at the signs of Hir@@ n @-@ trau@@ ma , since the girl was fallen by the alcohol and worked on the head , said R@@ it@@ ch@@ ey .
&quot; that was a fri@@ gh@@ tening , &quot; said Or@@ toria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ ough &apos;s mother , CNN .
it should have been deadly for my child .
L@@ op@@ ez is recommended to use parents and workshops to use non @-@ alcoholic products or disinfection products outside the baby &apos;s range .
about alcohol in@@ tox@@ ication , some disinfect@@ ants were connected with death .
in 2013 two women in Ontario died at the closing of wall @-@ infection agents that stain@@ ed toxic and non @-@ corrosive ingredients .
employees of health authorities , in fact , contained the product me@@ thanol listed , a deadly solution instead of ethylene &apos;s alcohol , which has been recorded as an active ingre@@ dient .
in January he planned three students of the fourth class in the state New York , their &quot; common &quot; teacher for for@@ ums , having anti@@ bacterial products around the class@@ room , &quot; says a police report .
the teacher is highly allerg@@ y against hand@@ ing Inf@@ ection and verb@@ al them from their room .
the police considered the failed plan called &quot; D@@ exter@@ ity &quot; and demonstrated strong measures to the school of school .

I do not believe that we feel under pressure I think that players are looking forward to it .
the lack of title competition in Scottish football - bo@@ res Dutch ? de Bo@@ er
the former ran@@ kings and former national players from the Netherlands Ronald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Cel@@ tic , there are no titles that exist with the ran@@ kings .
de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; in Holland she show no highlights of the Cel@@ tic games anymore and why ? &quot;
it is because the ran@@ kings are not there .
people are not only talking about the return of the Rang@@ ers .
they talk about the Old Fir@@ m .
they speak about both teams and that &apos;s what they &apos;re interested .
there is a lot of voltage in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and there are not only the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I &apos;ll turn the things , swe@@ ars D@@ eil@@ a .
R@@ onn@@ y D@@ eil@@ a accepted that Cel@@ tic should have to fight , but the Norwegian writer s@@ ware that deal about things .
after the defeat to Malmö and the following departure from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ men from Aberdeen , which is now represented by five points lead clearly at the top of the table .
D@@ eil@@ a said , &quot; Cel@@ tic had not earlier times , and we will come back . &quot;
now we want to get out as soon as possible .
I know , it &apos;s very fru@@ str@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry , very sad about that what happened .
we feel the exactly so - but we must go on further .
we really need the Cel@@ tic support , because that makes the players better .
it is so important to assem@@ ble .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Lee said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no squ@@ ad that won everything , in poker playing or li@@ gen , the games of this species have won &apos;t won . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while they in the United Kingdom ends in total .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged in the period from May until July unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom had increased as a whole in the same period by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.9 percent was above that of the U@@ K@@ s of 5.5 per cent , as the numbers of National Statistics for National Statistics only showed .
in the meantime , employment in Scotland fell in around 12,000 for the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12,000 .
the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent in the course of the quarter - an average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
the state Secretary for Scotland David W@@ ell concluded the latest numbers and said : &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot;
it is almost exactly a year ago that Scotland has made the historical decision to stay part of the United Kingdom .
during these 12 months , we have further improved further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline of unemployment .

why I am witness of a execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
something later , except for a late legal intervention , I will look on how a man is put to death .
when it happens , and I hope it will not occur , I will sit in a spect@@ ator at the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , if Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is executed by le@@ thal injection .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
the invitation first took place in January of the best friend of January , and although I sho@@ cked , I agreed .
when the day was closer , I began to fear myself .
so , why should I do it ?
I agreed to , because I thought it was a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists will see exec@@ utions in the US and often more applications are available as seats , a mak@@ ary lot@@ tery to decide who is elected .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
who will be selected , the industry can be watched in li .
I cannot do that .
I will sit in addition to Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ dies , with whom I developed my own relationship with telephone calls for months with a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
often we laugh often , when we speak .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the prison authorities say that I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to receive a not@@ ebook &amp; pen to capture what I see . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I just need to try to remember me of all details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me to aband@@ on my soul .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner , as he wants it , and you &apos;ll get access .
I cor@@ ked me with you .
she dre@@ amed that she &quot; it could have better phr@@ ased , &quot; but they still think it &apos;s wrong , what I do .
Richard G@@ los@@ s@@ p had a problem with some of the things I said and written .
he tells me not what I have to write , and I would not do it , even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants to be present for an international repor@@ ter in order to write there .
when he dies , he considers the public relations work movement to the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a repor@@ ter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will be sitting next to me .
if you would like to know more about the fall , please listen to the series of Pod@@ casts , which I have made .
I don &apos;t want to go back on all details .
I can not say that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assassination of Barry Van Bel@@ ief would pleaded him guilty to be a bene@@ fic@@ i@@ ary of fact .
but I believe that a strong probability is that it is not guilty of murder .
I think there is no sufficient evidence to just@@ ify a cause of death .
I believe that he is false .
and from that perspective I will die .
I can not claim that really being an objective .
there will be other repor@@ ter in which you can turn in for it .
what you will get from me , what es is to die a man will die unnecessary .

Peter Moo@@ dy claims that stew@@ ards tried to eliminate him and threatened to quit the racing
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that stew@@ ards of racing Victoria have tried to install a sp@@ y in its stamps itself and threatened to finish the race immediately .
he imp@@ aired on stew@@ ards and the operation Division of Racing Victoria and claimed that they had a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai on Wednesday due to a race @-@ day treatment , the last stro@@ kes on Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media , that he is always trying to do what is best suited to racing sports and he himself found himself under difficult conditions , when it went to explain the positive co@@ b@@ alt @-@ sample of Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain .
he had held 18 months because of sp@@ ying p@@ ion@@ age @-@ accus@@ ations and didn &apos;t want to see it as a highly @-@ bent grapes . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say anything to this , and I have eaten enough on it , but sometimes you are fru@@ str@@ ated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you know that it was progres@@ sed .
sometimes you respon@@ ds , and you have to live with the effects , and I must live with it , what I said .
I &apos;m going to go home today and sleep well .
I would like to go about the head , and I would like to think my owners , that I try my best for them .
if you start thinking , I do not do it , then I should be no more coach .
I then have to transfer what I was with my license .
in earlier , Moo@@ dy had advised the bomb in an interview with rac@@ usa that the integrity team had attempted to balance his barn .
&quot; over the age of eighteen months , Ter@@ ry B@@ ail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart in a room with a man - I &apos;m called to give him an employment in my st@@ ables , to deliver information on what I do in my st@@ alls , &quot; said Moo@@ dy on Rac@@ ism .
they seem to think that I am a im@@ ager .
if that case is case , they should surely hold their neck , because they try to gr@@ asp me with their attempt to receive me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David Moo@@ dy , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , and Bernard Sa@@ w , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of it at the time and today it still exists .
should I bring it to the view that it is personally speaking ?
does the R@@ V@@ L sei@@ ze you and makes people outside of train@@ ers responsible for this in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad about the industry ?
perhaps people think it is outside that I am so .
perhaps they have to take my license and re@@ ject me , and I have no doubt that what I say they now think about it now .
but I am at that point where I don &apos;t forget , and that makes me sad .
that makes me real sad .
I will exercise the pressure on them and dr@@ ushing it to make a decision .
I have to support my family and I can go .
the prot@@ ations level of the trainer have built up the long wave of co@@ b@@ alt @-@ investigation on Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching hold that he said he can disc@@ ard his license on the table . &quot;
Moo@@ dy , known for best known by his preparation of the un@@ ag@@ oned master@@ piece Black C@@ avi@@ ar , it was ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous after a package of mud or clay had been applied on the horses , which pushed for the rules .
&quot; it is against the rules of racing sports .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take over full responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; one of my employees has imposed er@@ ron@@ eous lu@@ dge to the leg .
it would have been that night like that .
it could have been the whole day yesterday , so it was so .
but it had also so on the race day .

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy beat out a lot of appeal against Ring@@ ing &apos;s sent@@ ers
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy has described the cr@@ ater of his players as &quot; Agenda &quot; Set@@ ting &quot; from two Premier League from 2 Premier League .
Sydney Roo@@ ster trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ee have voted the Storm player &quot; Ring@@ ing &quot; with his team during the high @-@ Storm Champion in Sydney on Friday night .
Brisbane Bron@@ co Trainer , Wayne Bron@@ co , had an appeal to the Storm team after his crew had the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land C@@ ow@@ boys in Saturday evening . he called the game sample example from the Rug@@ by League , and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land had not &quot; too good &quot; in the rings .
Bell@@ amy def@@ ended the team of his team and said that she is only concentrated on their &quot; touch . &quot;
Bell@@ amy moreover comm@@ enting that the criticism of two leading personal coach in his team might believe him , since it was concerned that they were wor@@ ried about the Storm team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s always up again - I didn &apos;t hear that Tr@@ ent Robinson on the ring games , when she had struck us 24 : 2 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that in all the year we have changed anything to our def@@ ensive system or the techniques but , in the last six weeks , we made our contact with t@@ ack@@ les , and this is the trend setting for us .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years , and he obviously has a magnificent team . he &apos;s therefore probably not getting used to lose it , so it was a little bit of shock for him .
it is strange that this season appears again .
Bell@@ amy presented the idea of &quot; thr@@ illing football &quot; and rec@@ alls its ment@@ or , that Ben@@ net@@ ts St George Il@@ lar@@ s@@ ra D@@ RA@@ G@@ ONS won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; w@@ anders &quot; soccer .
Wayne speaks of exciting football .
he compared his game on Saturday evening with our evening on Friday night and how exciting her play was , &quot; said Bell@@ amy .
I remember that in 2010 St George was a bor@@ ing team , and Wayne said that he will take care of a separation of divor@@ ce .
but now he has a team that can play and watch it as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
this is a ball game that you want to play if you &apos;ve got this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not each team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt , so they can play like those games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I build a tru@@ sting confidence because they &apos;re saying these things , because they are a little wor@@ ried about playing against us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
six weeks ago they did not think of us when it went to the Big Games .
Bell@@ inger also pointed out that the Storm Against Roo@@ ster &apos;s play had a higher profit than the game Bron@@ co to C@@ ow@@ boys .
the game of the bronze was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two further attempts at our game but it &apos;s an exciting game ?
or are sh@@ ausen and do not make any points behind @-@ ten@@ sion@@ ing ?
the ti@@ met@@ ables are for me .
if they mention ourselves , it means that we will continue in one phase even to her .
the Storm team is free at this weekend , since they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land C@@ ow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks on Saturday evenings during the finals in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales starts from the next service tomorrow .
rein@@ for@@ cements with 200.000 $ deposit to drugs
a man possibly stim@@ ulate the life of life threat@@ ening to land by 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine to land over Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a security deposit of 200,000 $ .
Marko Pol@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the police station found 100 kg of the drug on the Yacht Sol@@ ay , who arrived from South America via V@@ anu@@ at@@ u and placed in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed , as he was his co @-@ def@@ endants in the J@@ ach@@ th@@ afen in the after@@ no@@ ons and later at the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota echo .
despite a possibly life sentence for the attempt to possess a commercial use of Kok@@ ain , argu@@ ed the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , that there is no evidence that he tried to possess the entire amount and could have been in a somewhat less reason in a somewhat harm@@ less reason .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan was concerned about the threat of imp@@ unity in Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he declared the Court on Wednesday .
at the case he got the police over his residence .
Mak@@ si@@ mov@@ ics mother and st@@ ep@@ father had offered a security bond of 200.000 dollars as security jointly to release his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the ei@@ stic explanations of the two persons , it is clear that the edition of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Richter Flan@@ agan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he won &apos;t be enough to stop him , not to appear , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was released against damage , under the conditions that he announces his Australian and his Serbian passport , and get up at an initial lock at 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .

Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used telephone of girls to cur@@ l ped@@ oph@@ ile to sending images
the educ@@ ator used the phone in an 11 year old girl to demand pictures of child abuse .
Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the telephone of the girl , when this slept , log@@ ged into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a series of un@@ stable images of children who were sent to him by another user .
the girl wo@@ ke up later and discovered that the telephone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping H@@ og@@ g .
she looked at her , found the conf@@ using messages and al@@ armed immediately her mother .
the police tried out and looked the five pictures , analyzed the computer that were found under the address , and found &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; web research , used to search for in@@ consistent images of children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ og@@ g claimed that he had done it to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ped@@ oph@@ ile on the internet , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he then said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be a polic@@ eman in order to fri@@ gh@@ ten them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the state government Tur@@ i@@ h Robertson told the Dun@@ de@@ e Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be a wonder that he ad@@ dic@@ ts people to fri@@ gh@@ ten people .
he admitted that the sear@@ ches were carried out on the computer of him , but said it was done , because he always wanted to be a polic@@ eman in order to fri@@ gh@@ tened ped@@ oph@@ ile .
he was asked after talks with the un@@ familiar person who sent to him the pictures and asked him to send more photos .
he told he did so to temp@@ t her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said he had sick in the head , when he drinks , and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wants to see pictures of rape and murder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; MS Robertson Smith was added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was on the trembling and of weeping . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this then saw the in@@ consistent images on the phone and con@@ fron@@ ted the def@@ endants .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused computers and Play@@ station used to talk to girls who were younger than he was younger than he .
H@@ og@@ g , 23 , Ward Road , Dun@@ de@@ e decided to have made a permanent images of children on the 14th of June of last year , and not on January 25 this year had been cut off against the charges and not before his court appearance on 24 March this year .
the defense advoc@@ ate Gregory S@@ in asked that H@@ og@@ g doesn &apos;t appear in the Registry of Sex@@ ual Stra@@ vin@@ ter , as they argu@@ ed that &quot; there is no considerable sexual element &quot; in his face .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ m@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael rejected the verdict in October to obtain background reports about social work .
H@@ og@@ g was given a deposit in this case but was held in provisional custody for other adverse events of the time of hear@@ ings .

world power : every two years the car will show their novel@@ ties at the IAA .
2015 It is mainly familiar with the compact car that is currently used for selling very well .
cars from the compact class are particularly important : around 28.@@ 1 percent of new registrations were made in this segment by August alone at the end of August alone .
this also reflects the audience at the IAA ( Audi@@ ence days , September 17 - 27 ) .
this year , more new compact models will be presented between all the fut@@ ur@@ istic concepts and new luxury cars .
one of the biggest premier@@ es for the German automobile industry is the Opel Astra , who will win at deal@@ er@@ ships in autumn .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair .
he belongs to the core of the brand .
thus , the new Astra will also not be much more expensive than the new Astra .

in addition , the Hessen segment further include diesel and gasoline engines from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , and also includes three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines .
unlike the most important compet@@ itor Volkswagen Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is initially merely five @-@ fifth .
a second variation will be followed in spring of the com@@ bi which is already visible at the IAA .
and what will the Astra appeared on the new compact car next to the IAA ?
Renault Gr@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of the Astra quarters to enter the race .
at the trade fair , the Mé@@ viewer is shown exclusively on the five @-@ door in a conventional and an un@@ parall@@ eled GT version .
he will then be in trade at the beginning of next year , then as a com@@ bi .

J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square metres of cell are human !
the Court ordered a ex @-@ det@@ ain@@ ee from the prison quarters of Te@@ gel right , which was housed in a small cell with months .
because of the violation of their human rights , in@@ mates are generally eligible for financial compensation when they are accommodated in small cells .
this decision was made by the Federal Constitutional Court in one on Wednesday .
the suffer@@ ers can even be able to return to money if they were imprisoned only few days into their close spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
there@@ with , a former in@@ mate was successfully completed with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe . he was housed in an individual cell with around five square meters of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was spatial or separate .
after that , the man who resi@@ des himself after his lawyer stood still on the free foot , to a greater cell .
its detention leg@@ alization due to the un@@ born conditions of liability against the land Berlin fail .
however the constitutional judges accepted the decision of the Berlin Chamber of Berlin and rejected the case for the second examination .
they are not viol@@ ated the man &apos;s human rights .
Chamber Jud@@ gment now decide on the amount of compensation
also if the legal reasons , only a few days in prison for the compensation , a compensation was given , unless a compensation was given .
otherwise , &quot; a dis@@ closure of the legal protection of the personality should be feared . &quot;
the Chamber of Chamber needs to clari@@ fy the amount of money .
the constitutional complaint often strengthened the rights of prisoners of war in the past .
so they said first in April a det@@ ain@@ ty damages , because he was imprisoned in a cell nu@@ de .
human un@@ worthy is a ruling from 2011 to include the multiple capacity of a cell without separate toilet .
Moreover , on Wednesday , the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had a in@@ significant accommodation in a parall@@ el@@ ism , confirmed a in@@ significant accommodation on Wednesday in November 2009 .
the then bat was over three months , daily between 15 and 21 hours in a homogen@@ ous cell like in Karlsruhe .
the Berlin pris@@ ons had come to head@@ lines in the last weeks , too .
det@@ ain@@ ees are therefore heavily involved 23 hours , that rises to the aggres@@ si@@ vity to even get caught , due to the condition of the attack@@ ing location .
according to the information station you have not occupied 21 positions in Te@@ gel for young s@@ orts , 19 should fall away in 2016 .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we create the &quot;
the migration of refugees is a tremend@@ ous challenge - the Federal Chancellor is determined to accept them .
what &apos;s coming to Germany ?
approximately 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers are to be recru@@ ited to Germany by the Federal Ministry of the Interior , following statement by Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) and is able to record one million refugees .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated in view of the unusual challenge : &quot; I say again and again : we can do it , and we will do it . &quot;
what comes in Germany , medi@@ ates the following overview .
according to various forecasts , between 3@@ 50000 ( estimate of the German Federal Ministry of Labour ) and 400@@ 000 ( estimate of the Pest@@ ana Institute ) project annually - and for the next five years .
that is almost twice as much as it has to be built ( 25@@ 0000 ) .
dram@@ atically , the lack of living room but above all paid rental accommodation are caused by 600@@ 00 to 800@@ 00 social apartments from the rental binding , and in order to apply , these particularly advant@@ ageous flats .
Federal Minister of the Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) will therefore have doubled the funding of US $ 518 million to one billion euros .
much too little is to create the Pest@@ ana Institute : 80 000 Social residence annually and would need to invest € 6.4 billion in funding per year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; agree to scientists and Federal Ministry of Federal Government that there has also more tax advantages for investments in housing construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to estimates by the institute for labour market research and professional research , 55 % of the refugees in Germany can be employed in the long @-@ term .
however , the refugees in Germany are not systematically question@@ ed after their qualification , in order to help them at the entrance , Claudia Walter , Project Manager of Integration and Education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
for the integration of refugees , but it is crucial to find themselves in Germany .
work is the key to social contacts , for the appreci@@ ation in the economy , but also for the self @-@ est@@ e@@ em of the immigrants , says mig@@ rations of Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt .
in Germany , according to Thr@@ än@@ hardt , Germany has given a political turning point : from the prohibition of labour for refugees in recognition of work .
during a period of application for asylum seek@@ ers for five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the residence permit , the asylum seek@@ ers to be limited to a residence .
in the society itself - too because of the trade @-@ po@@ urs , largely excell@@ ently asser@@ ts that refugees should have access to the labour market faster than in order .
a big hur@@ dle for the access to the labour market are not a lack of German .
until now there is not yet sufficient supply in general and scientific @-@ related language courses .
research also show that jobs can be convey@@ ed most frequently through personal contacts .
this is why the development of networks is based on the govern@@ ance of the Königs@@ stein for the corporate integration process .
the Berlin school administration has found that only few skir@@ ting parents give their children to the Kit@@ ts , an estimated 10 to 15 per cent : &quot; for the discovery of parents , &quot; said Il@@ ja Ko@@ schem@@ bar , spokes@@ man for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration .
to convince the family of the benefits of the K@@ ita , manage the short@@ list in different languages .
if the need of gu@@ ardian have become strong by the great number of refugees , the Berlin Senate will try to increase the training capacity until about , having pulled more technical colle@@ ges .
pupils will be prepared in lessons without German knowledge in welcome groups .
however , they will not always be taught of all educated teachers and teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language .
in order to give them no lack , Be@@ ate St@@ airs become the owner of the Berlin school administration .
the German Student Union estimates that 20 percent of the refugees want to study in Germany .
in principle , no state asylum seek@@ ers or thought economics - the only exception was previously Berlin , the Wi@@ ens@@ en@@ ator Frank H@@ EN@@ G ( CD@@ U ) has finally abandoned its position .
academic fe@@ ed@@ in refugees may be facilit@@ ated by the university &apos;s entrance .
because refugees with a brood or Dul@@ ce can no longer receive any services based on the asylum protection law , if they begin studying .
the latter is not shown in principle . as they fall short in the circle of non @-@ privileg@@ ed persons .
thought refugees had to have lived for four years in Germany to be b@@ af@@ o@@ g at the end of January 2016 and was shortened to 15 months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this financing needs must be concluded , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Student Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the students should immediately get B@@ af@@ o@@ g .
Islam will in future be a crucial role in future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , the religion is an important part of its identity .
the State should be gradually seeking the same rights as they have churches , and that country &apos;s country has to continue to develop into a new state @-@ religi@@ ons relations .
it would also be important to the formation of the Islamic Dri@@ ving Association , which car@@ es for the new@@ com@@ ers .
the rights also belong to .
thus the representatives of Islam has to be certain and ready to move together with the state in many areas and to clean up certain control options .
to this also belongs to take up the read@@ iness to take up their religious Fund@@ ament@@ alism .
the chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern for concern , religious conflicts could also be entered into Germany .
those who wanted to go with such conflicts in Germany , &quot; have right to stay here in Germany , in Germany , &quot; he said in Bavarian radio .
he proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
integration will continue to be a lot more than today a topic of the whole society .
thus , the majority society has to change is affected by the elimination of discrimination and rac@@ ism .
the Germany has - as a result of European decisions , a anti @-@ discrimination law and a general principle of anti @-@ discrimination .
but it became very slow to study the NSU m@@ ord@@ o series , where the police and authorities ign@@ ore the rac@@ ist motive .
the same chances for all : what mig@@ rant organisations and stak@@ eholder groups would take both long and why international agreements are due to be a reality in the coming years if the country shall remain peaceful and its new citizens should use their possibilities to benefit from all their possibilities .
it is the fact that Germany has made the chance of a general supp@@ lic@@ ally to date one of the anticipated Democratic Republic , Frank Ulrich Mont@@ gom@@ ery of Germany as previously expected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what Man@@ - Power and Capacities , we do with this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the daily level . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , they must flow additional money into the system .
to prevent bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ gom@@ ery , all purchase documents did not take care of after the registration of health .
achievements we could be reck@@ oned by federal states later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the long term , it is highly reve@@ aler , so many people with the limited service tool in order to pre @-@ see the asylum of asylum . &quot; &quot; &quot;
otherwise , physi@@ cians do especially make language barri@@ ers .
so far , in Berlin , the Berlin Healthcare scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de demonstrated that migrants are treated worse than their in@@ firm@@ ities as other patients .
not only in clinics , in medical practice , interpre@@ ting costs will need to be charged .
but it would have helped many refugees too already with more generally medical institutions in the emergency services .
and with another diagnostic view .
among refugee camps there is about in@@ treated disabilities , and among the juven@@ iles it is going to recon@@ n@@ aissance HIV @-@ clari@@ fication .
German doctors of their education already clearly discovered following problems with some other diseases , but Mont@@ gom@@ ery es me as well .
&quot; paras@@ it@@ ash@@ ore or tuber@@ culosis are not so difficult to recogn@@ ise . &quot; and the fact that it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the doctors &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in sight be possibly even bound in sight because of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syrians had a high @-@ developed education system , while some refugees had even doctors .
however , in order to ut@@ ili@@ ze together , they would have to re@@ prove their quali@@ fications and vom@@ it them up again .
at least half of the refugees in Germany , according to estimates by the Federal Psycho@@ therap@@ ist ( B@@ Pt@@ K ) , most people suffer from post @-@ traum@@ atic strain relief or depression .
especially , the refugee camps , declared Dietrich Mun@@ z , president of the upper lid pt@@ c .
a recent study of the TU München was announced that every fifth Syrian refugee kids is traum@@ ati@@ zed in Germany .
if you cont@@ am@@ inated in a post@@ traum@@ atic load , is suffering from an so @-@ called Flash@@ backs with bre@@ aching , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart v@@ ases and death dist@@ resses .
further symptoms are sleeping and mental disorders , strong assault and emotional rup@@ eds .
in order to prevent symptoms of chronic hepatitis , it is necessary for early treatment , said Mun@@ z .
however , only four percent of psych@@ ologically ill people receive a psycho@@ therapy .
although psych@@ ic sick suffer@@ ers are able to put an application for psycho@@ therapy an application for a psycho@@ therapy , however , the processing takes usually several months .
furthermore , in the social offices mostly property workers or doctors who are not trained for mental illness , do not choose whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this often lead to mal@@ inv@@ alu@@ ation , says Mun@@ z .

the four @-@ leg@@ ged artists , &quot; how she will be called love , will be read after every wish of the eyes .
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
do the animal doesn &apos;t feel well , it wasn &apos;t until the arena .
so the upper command gave it good for the animals .
specially on her Zeb@@ roid Jum@@ bo , a mixture of a h@@ et@@ land pon@@ y@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a zeb@@ ra@@ des , is proud of the Pro@@ bst family .
the two animals have been together in one enclosure for eight years and nothing happens .
&quot; but then , suddenly , our small jum@@ bo was being a little jum@@ bo .
the zeb@@ ra is not yet ready for the arena , but this is the unique mascot of Circus Pro@@ bst .
so there should be something in the visitor .
&quot; one thing is safe , &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst , &quot; whether five or 1 200 spectators , we always give our best and are with a whole heart . &quot;
the Circus Pro@@ bst invites every day from 17 to 20 September , every day at between 17 and 20 o &apos;clock .
Sunday the programme starts at 11 am and 4 pm .
Thursday &apos;s family day , for the performance at 17 o &apos;clock , the prices are dis@@ counted .

Sim@@ cor@@ w@@ it Robert Mug@@ abe gives a false speech in parliament
M@@ R Mug@@ abe , The oldest Afri@@ cans , fell down the steps at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case was spread rapidly over the social media .
the Parliament &apos;s opening was also troubled by alleg@@ ations of M@@ EP@@ s from the opposition that they had received anonymous anniversary , and had warned them before , to super@@ v@@ ise the address given by Mr Mug@@ abe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; last month they hat@@ ched and warned him during his speech on the position of the nation in parliament - this is the words which he repeated on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the spokes@@ man of the Movement for Democratic Change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) Inno@@ cent Gon@@ esis said that seven Opp@@ os@@ itions and politicians have received SMS messages on their phone which they warned against Mr. Mug@@ abe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the news is from one number that will not appear , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said he repor@@ ters to Mug@@ an@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it war@@ ns the European Parliament members , that the immun@@ ity ends in the Parliament , as soon as they leave the parliament , its parliamentary immun@@ ity is no more effective .
the spokes@@ man spoke the party by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i , &quot; Concer@@ ned over the dangers for the politicians .
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard will then cost up to 30.000 jobs
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard is expected to settle up to 30,000 jobs in the framework of re@@ structured and savings &apos;s efforts in the company &apos;s services .
HP will split up to two listed companies in two listed companies and to split the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing enterprise hardware and its service activities .
the expected space management resulting from over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , HP said in a statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will allow a more competitive , sustainable cost structure for the new Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP leader and Chief Executive that will lead the unit following the separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise is smaller and more focused than HP today , and we have a wide and deep@@ est range of shops that support companies at a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man .
as an independent company , we are set up better than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise has more than 50 billion annual turnover and will be focused on deployment , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; says the company &apos;s explanation .
it divi@@ des a company which was founded in the 19@@ 30s from the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hew@@ lett and Dave Packard , in order to manufacture electrical installations and vessel of the Sil@@ icon Valley .
HP has featured solid restructuring and make the back @-@ up of traditional PCs to handle mobile devices .
the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturers and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this area that is based on the convic@@ tion that the focused businesses can deliver better performance .
FC Arsenal @-@ captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team mates at the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb stood behind the past Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere .
W@@ enger pointed out to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation have been under plan there is no reason why he couldn &apos;t play before Christmas .
this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere is sure to miss the next four games for England , and despite its history , its participation will be un@@ certain due to its participation in the next summer .
the great dis@@ grace of this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had ended the last season after a separate ank@@ le battery , and then again to its old tail during the pre@@ season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this type of injury is not threatened the career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ enger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is a bone , that not healed .
this is not a big issue .
this was just an accident .
there was not in connection with his an@@ kl@@ es or with the bre@@ aches that he had before .
this may be true from p@@ urely biological perspective , but as W@@ enger acknowledged , there is the related risk of another injuries , always when a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it is also an un@@ pleasant pattern .
Prime Minister In@@ jur@@ ies Ltd has recorded 23 different ill@@ nesses of Wil@@ sh@@ ere in his debut six years ago .
it also played in 16@@ 65 out of Ar@@ sen@@ than 157 Lig@@ as@@ ian in the last five times .
the wider picture for Arsenal won that they have been one of eight playing times since 2007 / 08 , one of the two Premier League clubs , most of the po@@ ison .
W@@ enger accepts the potential of inflation , but Arsenal also believe that an improvement in the po@@ aching rate will last during the last season .
&quot; sometimes , if you come from a wound , you have a vulner@@ able period , a time in which you have to strengthen your body and combat physical struggle , &quot; said W@@ enger .
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body stabil@@ ized , I am confident that he will do it and he will run a career of the way which he deser@@ ved .
Arsenal begins his Champions League @-@ season on Wednesday night against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ fix on Wednesday evening , and W@@ enger introduces a rotation inside the team .
H@@ é@@ cular Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey travelled to Croatia in Croatia , which means the Math@@ ieu Deb@@ uch@@ y and Art@@ eta are to start .
W@@ enger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ ro@@ ud in lie@@ u of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep balance the balance and the players who require it , a small breathing @-@ pause , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ enger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although they are clear to join in group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the most in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation effect in Europe .
dynam@@ o is un@@ defeated after 41 games after the &quot; un@@ defeated &quot; campaign started in the last season .
the stadium was sh@@ aken by an earthquake on Tuesday , where they were measured on the Richter scale 3.2 .
this year it was the 10th of Zagreb .
W@@ enger is the opinion that Arsenal had pulled the teaching from last season with the Champions League @-@ capit@@ ulation towards Monaco , and left from the far hope , with his management led the association to his first European ok@@ al triumph .
&quot; this drive is imm@@ en@@ sely , &quot; said W@@ enger .
they never opened in Arsenal 2 .
we were very close in 2006 , but on the other side , I long enough in the business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we don &apos;t dre@@ am@@ ers .
friendship Festival : the Com@@ edy show that awarded us serious lessons on men &apos;s friend@@ ships
the lack of similar statements in shows is obvious , especially in particular with regard to what the need for men to open himself now has now more des@@ per@@ ate than ever before young men at a 15 @-@ year @-@ h@@ och .
in 2013 , it was the most important death of men in men at the age of 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and there is three times more common among men than women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , Camp@@ a@@ ign Against The Living ( CA@@ LM - campaign against a her@@ edit@@ ary life ) launched in 2015 as the year of the man with the aim being asked to ask help those men if they need them .
friendship is the heart of the struggle to tackle this challenge .
a current study of more than 2,000 high @-@ school students with de@@ pressed symptoms were noted that when the dead end had a suff@@ ici@@ ently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy atmosphere , &quot; his chances of pleas@@ ures doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of spiritual healthy individuals are the risks of mental problems .
but of course one must have only friends , so that a friendship can work .
in the age of through social media , communication with their main focus on substance is the im@@ pet@@ us of response often more important than an important contact form .
our digital life have the need to make strong , life @-@ fun and successfully , even if in reality the isolation domin@@ ates .
this super@@ ficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists ex@@ tr@@ ins@@ om@@ ic values . money , image , social status , everything on in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner vision requests , according to personal development and friendship , en@@ acted on our spiritual health a lot of deep levels .
and how a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire explained that money can really buy luck .
the beauty at Friends was that this foc@@ us@@ ment was put on the head .
any character is not defined by his work but , through its personality , sh@@ ined by the interaction as a friend .
the hum@@ or of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ lers had frequent h@@ ugs to stay at a disciple in cosy st@@ ills and the lon@@ ging of Ross after Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that males can refer to each case , even if they often go back to explore fully their feelings .
like a staff of the telephone service , it declared to me : ... &quot; my fe@@ as@@ ants for people who feel de@@ pressed and self @-@ vulner@@ able , has showed me as much as the smallest inter@@ actions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us is often not able to talk with friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old Rede@@ mp@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I stra@@ ight@@ forward &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means an enormous effect as the feeling that it is perceived as weakness , if you speak about problems &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Friends is one of the shows that occur in my mind if I try to offer long @-@ term corporate mechanisms .
you presents very clearly the small moments of defects .
thus very my objective External Se@@ arch@@ ers state over@@ look the man &apos;s telephone in moments of desp@@ air , we can also help long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you enjoy this weekend Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ ship with the celebration of the day completely redesigned setting , why do not take your friends to drink at a cocktail in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better if you &apos;re car@@ ving in a Star@@ bu@@ cks one alone , give it a smile and say hello to you .
one never knows how to make your friendship .
friends is transmitted to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to end - the total of 236 episodes - for # friendship Festival
di Maria meets the PS@@ G in order to cr@@ ush the Malmö
angel Di Maria celebrates Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after a while against Malmö .
in his debut at the Champions League on Tuesday and the PS@@ G helps to train in Malmö .
here are the Game Report and response to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani course started when Paris Saint @-@ Germain had his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malmö in the prince @-@ style stadium on Tuesday .
in fact , less than four minutes after the start of the Champions League de@@ but@@ s as PS@@ G player , which brought the French champion on the way , but after it just missed a lead , when it finally achieved their lead , when Cav@@ ani employed a head@@ band for the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Sch@@ acht@@ um Don@@ ez@@ k also in the Group A is offering a strong start against the Swedish champion , since it is not only the qualification for the K.@@ O@@ .-@@ races , but an improvement on the way to the quarter final in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they had received the points there was not a class example of Laurent Bl@@ anc@@ an &apos;s team with Z@@ lat@@ an Ibra@@ him@@ pas@@ ić . he was later taken out in the game against his home town team and against the association , with whom he har@@ kens his lively career back in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . therefore , it is a good start to create and relaxed problems , even when there are certain things we need to discover during the season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; this is a good sign .
we wanted to win and we &apos;ve won , though I ab@@ st@@ alled that we have not even scored one or two further goals . &quot;
Ibra@@ him@@ ovic returned to Paris @-@ team after his injury to the Paris @-@ team that could last a 2 : 2 oun@@ ced on its own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was put out by Di Maria in the fourth last minute .
the Argentin@@ ian imp@@ eller was named as the man named , the PS@@ G was taken over to the next level in Europe , while it was taken over by Marco Ver@@ r@@ att@@ is Pass behind the Malmö defense , before he donated to the long corner of the grid .
but if anyone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a big win , he was disappointed .
Malmö , the Cel@@ tic broke off from a play @-@ off to reach this level , stood at An@@ pi@@ ff with nine nation@@ alists on the field and had reached a five @-@ man @-@ attack and two deep in the middle range is a difficult opponent .
but besides a shot of Nikola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , which is enclosed in Kevin Tra@@ pp@@ s P@@ fo@@ sten in 34@@ th minute , it drove out little in the attack .
instead the PS@@ G gave themselves sometimes , with some mal@@ formation and bad after@@ g@@ ums , not least from Ibra@@ him@@ ovic , who was not least until five trials in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used it after re@@ bo@@ oting .
nevertheless , he had a lot more fortun@@ es when he brought his opponent into the game , and it was a Pass of Ibra@@ him@@ ovic , walked in with Maria in a hub that surrounded by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the P@@ fo@@ sten ...
the second gate finally fell after the hours brand thanks to Cav@@ ani . at Uruguay this was the sixth gro@@ tor , after Ibra@@ him@@ ovic had left a left fl@@ ank of Max@@ well .
that ended all the idea that Malmö came back in the game , and just an excellent intervention by Wil@@ de from shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , which was able to cut the final result before the replacement part of E@@ equ@@ iel Lav@@ e@@ zzi can cut a gate at the end .
the trainer of Malmö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , announced later that PS@@ G played a class on his team , and the Norwegian people said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last December last year .
since then we played only in the Swedish League , which has not the same level .
the qualifying games are not enough . &quot;
hat from before Paris !
it was a great game of them !

Detroit Tig@@ ers first pass to Minnesota Twin@@ s
MIN@@ NE@@ HY@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ the second half of the season was not very funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
in a season , they once was one of the top teams in bas@@ eball . today the tiger eye on the last place in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but played this role on Tuesday &apos;s perfectly against the Minnesota &apos;s record with 5 @-@ 4 Target @-@ Field .
the Twin@@ s also spent a chance to asc@@ end in Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card seats .
for Detroit , although only for an evening , it was a return of the three letters F @-@ word , which was so difficult to summar@@ ise in a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; all victories have been fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Aus@@ mus .
Tiger tra@@ cher . Alfredo Simon took up his early offensive support when Detroit looks for three times in the first two in the sixth and then once at the ninth time .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) wo@@ ke up 6 times in the 1 / 3 inner and allowed three of us .
it was only his third successful start in his final nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to end this year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s hard to thro@@ wing every game in the bul@@ l@@ do@@ zers , and so I want to focus completely into the game .
the designated tiger @-@ h@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , its first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three @-@ hit @-@ game of Mart@@ ine@@ z when he had four hits for the Seattle of Marin@@ ers on July 6 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has held this wood well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said fil@@ mic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good out at a ( impact training ) , saw distinc@@ tly more from the bul@@ l@@ do@@ zers , and he brought it directly into the game .
with three races at the rear meeting at the end of the seventh inland , Twin@@ s had their best chance to come back into the game .

the tig@@ ers achieved three races during the first two arms against the ban@@ ker &apos;s veter@@ an who had been deleted from the game of the po@@ iling list because he had stolen more than one month because of a sp@@ inning .
&quot; obviously not the beginning , which I desired , &quot; said Hug@@ hes , &quot; but I felt that happ@@ ier as I watched and felt that I would create some quite good pit@@ falls in the third inning . &quot;

begin first go@@ dd@@ ess , then striking cold front
next night the tor@@ n@@ ul@@ ae of the Alps @-@ side of the F@@ öh@@ n broke out , as if Met@@ e@@ o@@ wel@@ z gave them on Tuesday .
on Wednesday and night , the n@@ öh@@ n bl@@ ends in part with a n@@ urs@@ ing force due to wind strength .
after hearing at the morning , we cross a striking cold front , the powerful ra@@ ins , wind b@@ ö@@ ches and a temperature dec@@ ay .
as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News is written in a statement , Switzerland currently includes an extensive underground press area than the British Is@@ les in a strong southern @-@ western stream .
at the alpine face it breaks through the valleys , in the night .
in the episode of th@@ öh@@ n th@@ urs@@ ing up to th@@ urs@@ ing tomorrow with bows of 60 to 100 km / h , some of it is partly st@@ aging and partly in the Ur@@ ru@@ land partly with more than 100 km / h .

Rome now has a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz .
in the presence of St. Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino , an so far @-@ called pri@@ eval space in the park was baptised on the name of the German Re@@ forms on Wednesday .
at the Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , he is now honoured as the &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot;
the park is in the middle of Rome regardless of the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the name argument had been applied to the church community of the protest@@ ant churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , past@@ or of the Evangelical Lutheran congregation in Rome , remin@@ ded those who protests in the city of the Pop@@ es over centuries as a minority which could only live in secret .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this place will be visible in symbolic terms that your tradition of Christian faith is in Rome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) spent a couple of months in Rome as a young family @-@ dol@@ in@@ dul@@ ge in the turn of the year 15@@ 10 @-@ 11 .
he received the city at that time as a sin@@ c@@ ere sens@@ ory cable .
his negative impressions would be encouraged him of chast@@ ening the hist@@ ori@@ ans in his later fight against Rome .
in Luther , Luther introduced the split of the domestic church with his thes@@ es .
hammer Artist did for three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the gold @-@ plated ( gold @-@ plated ) is one of the main works created by the Ot@@ mar Alt in his bi@@ ble .
Klaus Al@@ te@@ Mail has updated the introduction and published translations .
at the beginning was the Word ?
no , not in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which has now appeared with magnificent pictures now .
in the beginning the painting for Ot@@ mar Alt , which has formulated his personal interpretation of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 different moti@@ fs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colourful colors and imag@@ in@@ ative forms has the 75 year old - but what does not means much like this with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mer@@ ry &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary : the respective topics can be taken , which , in fact , may be dark .
&quot; &quot; &quot; around three years , Ot@@ mar will collabor@@ ated with his bi@@ ble project for which he has met a sub@@ jective &quot; artistic selection from the many different topics of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; books of all books . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are cycles that dev@@ ote himself to topics such as Cross , pl@@ agues , commandments or pat@@ ern@@ ity .
this means that he has been fascin@@ ated several partners : it applies to Luther @-@ publishing company with his the@@ ological alignment , as well as for the Kettler @-@ Verlag with his main focus on art books .
and since then , the author Klaus Al@@ te@@ Mail , who has been dealt with the respective quot@@ ations of study on the basis of painting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he interpreted the Scrip@@ tures from Ot@@ mar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; into current con@@ texts &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these lyrics are like verb@@ al mirror of al@@ ert painting .
these are nest@@ led between the original Bible family of Martin Luther and from one proposition of the artist , who presents his own personal thoughts about the situation .
the jewel@@ ery is made of gold letters .
the 75 year @-@ old allows you to double a deep insight into his soul and emot@@ ions .
that is a high level of In@@ tim@@ acy .
E@@ mot@@ ions finally were the trig@@ gers for the Bible : Ot@@ mar Old , born 1940 in Wer@@ n@@ ig@@ er@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family who attended the strict Protestant ruling .
&quot; there the up@@ bringing ever to the second floor , &quot; Ot@@ mar &quot; is rec@@ alled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I tried to set up the way , in order to also bear me with the Lord &apos;s Father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second attempt was to raise the art in the quick@@ est time again to more importance : &quot; the perception of Bild@@ wel@@ ten is marked by the l@@ ame today , and it is no@@ isy .
Sym@@ bo@@ lic is being displac@@ ed .
artists have a different desire and delight , things to show .
pictures have always something significant and are not decorative .
&quot; in that respec@@ ts , I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would you want to aband@@ on the images &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to aband@@ on him , and feel that they will feel themselves : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the image is looking for his counter@@ part . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klaus Al@@ te@@ Mail concluded on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; still a &quot; lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Art &quot; : &quot; I like to understand how he under@@ stands his pictures . &quot;
and have not observed it to capture the Bible , but which are important for him , also mysterious themes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was not the cooperation of the eye , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Al@@ te@@ Mail : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the pictures depic@@ ts the lyrics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we developed a pictures of the Bible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is an invitation for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler by Luther Verlag . it is an invitation to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his life for deep and freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts pictures speak for professionals both the ( bi@@ blical ) language of love as well as responsibility .
a part of the original - paper and screen image - will be presented for the first time at an exhibition that will be opened in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung on November 15 .
construction of BM@@ X @-@ Bahn is starting
plans have made , place found , companies en@@ forcement to mod@@ ail for a circuit : one year later almost everything was ready , but still before the official opening of the BM@@ X train was finally finished .
fail@@ ures in politics and administration provided for tre@@ ut , especially with the inhabitants , which wanted to im@@ patient the railway .
thus , obli@@ que up , new place - now with formal planning and application on building permit .
the approval may enter in October , the first common hall of Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bock , who also took part in the children &apos;s child and youth committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope that this year is still clear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will then start without &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; additional tru@@ ce &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; started with the works at the former Indoor pool . &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies engagement for refugees
the DF@@ B expands its commitment to refugees to 2019 , the Bundesliga showed a significant mark on the weekend .
the football respon@@ ds to the most important situation in Germany and sec@@ ures politics to dis@@ close their help with tack@@ ling the upcoming problems .
&quot; I have been doing this for the biggest challenge of our country since the re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one can say in the way that I do nothing , I have nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must be interested in every single , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B Director Wolfgang K@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to seriously distur@@ bed the refugee situation in Germany .
&quot; I &apos;m next Wednesday at the Chancell@@ ery and meet the State Minister Mr@@ s Ö@@ zo@@ v , and the Chancellor . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the topic is safe to play a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the football can also help .
but the decisive course must make the policy .
the German Football Association therefore has committed his refugee &apos;s initiative 1 : 0 for a welcome party by four years .
&quot; we have ensured through the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us Braun Stiftung , we have ensured that this program runs until 2019 , &quot; said ren@@ s@@ bach , on the outskirts of the UEFA European Meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta .
also some federal government statements support this programme .
this weekend the 36 pro@@ fi@@ dent are a significant sign when they are going on the left Tri@@ k@@ ot@@ är@@ y instead of usual Spon@@ sor@@ ship ( Hermes ) : &quot; we will help to carry the &apos; # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; tax .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make clear that all people will help , where and how they can only , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen Sport@@ sman Rud@@ i Völ@@ ler , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Zeitung ( Tuesday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the refugee of Refu@@ ge@@ es goes on every day , and nobody can see it . &quot;
&quot; we may be able to use soccer league , no , we need to use our spot@@ less power , our influence and our possibilities to help many refugees that already suffered so tremend@@ ous , &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz .
H@@ offen@@ hei@@ ms Managing Director Peter Ret@@ tig said of a &quot; prominent symbol of the League &quot;
for this Friday , the national team of women in Germany invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale on Friday .
Nier@@ s@@ bach maintained the support of refugees as &quot; a large community of German football . &quot;
that all 36 licens@@ ors have started their own projects , be great .
equally great is that small and smallest clubs are active there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which we have spent is living in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this and next year the association will al@@ locate 300 000 Euro together with the DF@@ B selection and the Federal Government for the integration of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the associations have already subscri@@ bed the total money for 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; reported K@@ w@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the CEO of Europe &apos;s largest software company , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , reported a number of reports , due to a fall from July , the left eye was lost .
at the accident at the stairs in his brother &apos;s house in the United States , he has fallen on a water@@ glas at midnight , which he was in the left hand , reports the &quot; economic week &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; he is almost her@@ al@@ ded , is troubled , and drag@@ ged himself into the street - that &apos;s he tells us so last week , &quot; the &quot; W@@ IW@@ O &quot; SAP Con@@ co @-@ founder Has@@ so Plat@@ ner .
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could go after his work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October , we meet one meeting of the Supervisory Board meeting at Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Plat@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager is meeting and &quot; full of work &quot; at the meeting .
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday ) , &quot; he will come back to Germany in October and follow the following software companies .
&quot; I &apos;m full for SAP , full in my job . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , I was standing in contact with the Supervisory Board and whose president Has@@ so fl@@ ner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t weighed between Germany and the U.S. , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it may be important to go to the public with such a personal story , said the manager &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone can happen to everyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to rise again if you have fallen away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

football : Bv@@ H without Re@@ us against Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : wil@@ lows in the gate
when Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund had all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco Re@@ us in the first group game of the Europa League finally destroyed .
the national player is also missing the championship leader of the soccer league in the Du@@ el with the FK Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19.00 / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , we cannot fall back upon him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el said on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Re@@ us will be back on Sunday in the Bundesliga match versus Le@@ verk@@ usen , the BV@@ B @-@ Coach would open : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
given the high load of its pro@@ s , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change its gen@@ us to the Re@@ us position .
thus he announced a change to the door@@ ke@@ e@@ position .
therefore , Roman Wei@@ den has a name of gen@@ e@@ art@@ ender to the art@@ ender .
&quot; finishing on an absolute top level , &quot; the football @-@ teacher now praised the world champion .
whether Wei@@ den@@ ier is going to be used in all Europe League games , Tu@@ ch@@ el has been un@@ opened .
it will also contest the second game with high probability .
the Canadian statement from Mit@@ su@@ us Re@@ us says that the final result for the BV@@ B in the Europe League will be the target for their comp@@ ti@@ ers : &quot; this is Marco &apos;s not so wrong . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to access the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the Federal Cab@@ inet agreed on Wednesday a strategy paper from the House of Transport Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which provides additional investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
Do@@ brin@@ dt spoke at Wednesday in Frankfurt at the del@@ ines of the Autom@@ fair IAA in a &quot; new mobile age . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the automated and connected driving will increase the traffic safety and provide for less st@@ utter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Do@@ brin@@ dt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also wants to discuss the topic with his counter@@ part from the G7 states , which are also closely together with representatives of the industry .
the strategy document of the Ministry of Transport is under@@ st@@ under@@ ed the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and an easy access to digital radio channels .
the testing of new technology is currently being developed on the highway 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the driver &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks will be raised , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the federal government wants to verify the legal framework &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and is necessary to adjust the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , Germany is going to be used internationally that the permissible speed for self @-@ driving cars will be increased from 10 to 130 km / h .
the federal government also wants to apply for a change to the Vienna Convention , to date only the people as driver .
in the automated driving in increasing measures the car takes the lead , the driver will be more and more to passenger .
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras , which will detect the environment and processing the data in seconds .
according to the study conducted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , automated driving on motor@@ ways by 2020 will be technically possible .
nevertheless , driving less vehicles in public roads have only been waiting until 2020 . &quot;
the value added in the area of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at its Reutlingen location will appreciate the authors of the study for 2025 to approx . 8.4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of trucks that carry more security and efficiency on road traffic &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the SPD @-@ Traffic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ ör@@ en Bart@@ ol &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the issue of liability for accidents and security of personal dates of the driver must be clari@@ fied clearly .
even by the Germans , the motor@@ cyclists could still see - much more than the french or Americans .
one of Wednesday on the AA presented provided by the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the Committee of the DE@@ K@@ RA comes back to the result that only eight percent of Germany believe that autonomous driving cars will inc@@ ur in the next ten years , 32 percent are only for 20 years to believe , 31 percent do not believe it at all .
in France , 21 percent of those survey@@ ed by 2025 , with autonomous driving cars , are currently 33 percent .
the drivers in Germany are not yet ready to leave their self @-@ driving vehicle .
upon issu@@ ing the digital network Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would be approved to aband@@ on all roads during the whole trip .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the highway , traffic could imagine 15 percent , while the traffic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; turns 45 per cent &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in good morning the car would not let control under any circumstances .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then Timo didn &apos;t regre@@ t , and we became European champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; at this time , we should ori@@ ent ourselves , &quot; explained the fifth line of the world .

Gaul@@ tier feels towards an end to become an end .
it &apos;s a mixture of great fashion show and a wax w@@ afer @-@ Gr@@ us@@ el@@ Di@@ et : the designer Jean Paul Gaulle ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on Wednesday in Munich on Wednesday .
the highlights : man@@ nequ@@ ins , all of them made with major projec@@ tions .
they bear the spectacular cre@@ ations of the French designer , among other things with Mad@@ onn@@ as Stage out@@ fits to the big star of the fashion scene - and there@@ with , he put men in co@@ ats .
&quot; I can no longer say today that I am the end in the Haute Cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; previously , it was b@@ old , in the meantime , it is still &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Austria &apos;s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) which is to be seen from the 18th of September at the Kunsth@@ alle of the hyp@@ o culture foundation , it is a good fortune to perform the fashion designer at a watch over his person . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; actually , he didn &apos;t have such a sort of death for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you &apos;re in the museum .
the impressive collection was created in Montreal and Paris in earlier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger D@@ ieder@@ en . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits indicate an insight into which hardly an overview of the man &apos;s work , written in fashion history , without ever having witn@@ essed a training .
chron@@ ologically the show is not built , but it is an excell@@ ently chore@@ ograph@@ ed total body , for which much effort was operated : in order to cra@@ ze the d@@ olls , has been blo@@ cked for example .

&quot; &quot; &quot; he is always interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gaul@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also the French ted@@ dy Teddy is also seen at the exhibition .
it stands for the first , tender modifications of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and po@@ or@@ ly in football ) he put on his Teddy B@@ HS and clothes , she said the Gaul@@ tier .
to play with a doll , his parents would not have allowed him .
he refused to thro@@ wing the fashion of fashion itself afterwards .
he st@@ ole fashion magazine and saw the designs of other designers as French Gaul@@ tier says in Munich .
later I bought that .
for his first official fashion show he did not pay the models .
they had no idea , but had to mo@@ ck the clothes .
jew@@ ellery from Lake Garda - Pl@@ au@@ ded top as fashion @-@ wal@@ let
it used to be ro@@ oted in the long stit@@ ches @-@ plan@@ ers and to make plots therefore 100 meters .
the embroi@@ dered materials and tips were made in great amount for customers who , for example , processed for ceilings and curtains .
the alone does not work anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , managing director of the Mo@@ th@@ ieves .
instead the mode is important .
in the starting times of plan@@ au@@ ener , fashion has played a larger role , then has been displac@@ ed by the hom@@ textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt calls a few examples : tip in jewelry , accessories such as bags and for regional cost@@ umes .
at all , the so @-@ called vintage style , which re@@ jects on past ep@@ ilep@@ o@@ chen , is an increasing client policy .
who is not operating in the textile branch in Germany , is no longer on the market .
half of all the orders come from us already in case of us .
Mo@@ asse Pl@@ ate is put at the industry association with nine other companies at the industry association of pl@@ au@@ ener and embroi@@ der@@ ies .
only they may bear the protected label .
in the past 15 years around 80 per cent of the turnover are broken .
private shops and wholesale for wholesale accounts are almost no longer .
there are hardly any of our products on this road .
the mass goods are produced much cheaper in the Asian region and almost exclusively distributed over chains .
besides , the export is currently being weak , currently to Russia and the USA .
plenty of reason enough for new ways .
the industry association also tries to rely on environmental awareness , including Cord@@ ula Bauer from the Emb@@ ro@@ i@@ per@@ le to Fal@@ ken@@ stein : &quot; since this year we have led a seal , which shows that we are therefore able to produce ec@@ ologically and soci@@ ally . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this refers to the materials used also . &quot;
graduate U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schnee@@ berg outer station at the University of Applied Sciences Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts , and is specialized in embroi@@ der@@ ies and tips .
to meet the competition from Asian region , you have to find high quality and innovative products .
this takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is a starting field between the fresh@@ ness ideas for designer and the firms that need to be beneficial especially econom@@ ically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Shi@@ eld &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , an existing design of existing design will often only varies in order to maintain a customer strain .

the master crafts@@ man Brothers in B@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ se had inspired him : &quot; before I was nothing to start with traditional pl@@ au@@ ctions . &quot;
now they use the screw top for their jewelry .
in a complex procedure , they shaped the pattern in silver .
&quot; many people in the region focuses on pl@@ au@@ stri@@ ction - young and old , &quot; says Reu@@ ter .
they also supplies to Australia , Australia and Finland - primarily to customers whose ancestors have lived in pl@@ itudes and surroundings and want to remember a mem@@ ento .
with that I see my jewelry as a modern ambassador of the pl@@ au@@ ener .

XI For@@ ms to open the economy broad , wider to the world
the economy must also be open wider to the outside , in order to promote growth , said President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping to manage a group allowing the de@@ fle@@ ction of the reform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should therefore deplo@@ y foreign investments and know @-@ how , and improve the strategies for business applications , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said in an address at the 16th session of the central management group for the deep@@ ening of a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cur@@ i@@ osity to promote and re@@ treat reforms will promote new weakness and vit@@ ality and offer new standards for economic growth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said X@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the guide was adopted a series of guidelines , including a negative list on the Regulation of market access , recreation of the border controls policies , promote government transport ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ h@@ aul of the residents of the security system .
after statement a negative list , the sectors and companies are identified , which will not come into question for investments .
the system is gradually tested and tested by testing programs .
the initiative is of importance as it guarantees the market a major role in allocation of resources , a legal state of business , and open the market open , said the statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government shall also cur@@ ls controls on the powers deleg@@ ated to the companies and ensure that companies decide how they perform their business . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the statement also said that China will allow border regions to explore new models of border @-@ border economic co@@ operations and new mechanisms of promoting the regional growth .
additional areas open for private investment will be opened as part of an offer , state controlled and controlled sectors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the lawful interests of foreign funds and give better services to them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , it is made easier for foreigners to request a lasting residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; work to be facilit@@ ated by the requirements and the application process will be facilit@@ ated .
the law of lawyers to guarantee , work on employment , and professional judges and state prosec@@ ut@@ ors were also discussed at a session .
at the meeting , Prime Minister Li Ke@@ qi@@ ang and important leader such as Li@@ u Yun@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli participated , as published in one after the declaration published .
EU aims to double the limit in pir@@ ated fishing
the European Commission plans to double the limit values of mercury in large mat@@ fish and produce a significantly higher dose of ner@@ ve gifts .
the consumer organization F@@ ood@@ watch , who is the corresponding working draft in the EU , critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; risks and side effects of short@@ ages of industrial and environmental policy , &quot; explained Matthias Wol@@ mi@@ dt of F@@ ood@@ watch .
Wolf@@ schmi@@ dt also aims to reduce the limit values of the Ner@@ ve gi@@ f@@ tes for large fish at the end of the food chain such as shar@@ k or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish from &quot; economic policy &quot; and increased from one to two milli@@ gram of mercury per kilogram of fish .
huge fish @-@ fish already are so strong together with mercury that on the basis of the currently applicable limit values , approximately 50 per cent of the catch are not sold .
after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.5 percent be rejected .
in turn , the EU according to F@@ ood@@ le , the EU is to download the limit values for other fish from currently 0.5 mg to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram .
F@@ ood@@ watch illustrated it as &quot; tri@@ ck , &quot; because smaller do@@ cks , like approximately car@@ p , usually imp@@ acted as low that they already with@@ hold the planned maximum levels today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the re@@ mark on the topic is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ de de@@ fle@@ ction solution , which helps in the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Wolf@@ mi@@ dt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a highly po@@ ison@@ ous heavy metal , which strongly stim@@ ulated on the food chain mainly in bo@@ b@@ fishing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the federal government requires that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only small amount of damage to the nervous system can also arise &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Environment Ministry put on its homepage with regard to the applicable limit values , however that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health endang@@ ering &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could not be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is primarily reached through carbon burning in the environment .
according to a written information by the Federal Ministry of Environment , Ann@@ alena Ba@@ er@@ bo@@ ck and the German coal plants arrived more than six tons of mercury in the year , which provides two @-@ thirds of the total amount in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mercury in fish approximately in river Elbe , Rhine and Danube would &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; permanently and country @-@ wide &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the &quot; Spiegel &quot; had quoted from paper in March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , Europe @-@ wide war@@ nings of mercury in fish already counted as to the most commonly reported health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
