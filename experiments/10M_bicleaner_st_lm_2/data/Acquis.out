if a result is used by the manufacturer recommended , the following factors or appar@@ itions may not occur : a ) of the mol@@ y@@ tic properties ;
the tit@@ er is measured by always new di@@ lution of the test to double the double in a suitable medium .
the tit@@ er is the true value of the strongest ser@@ um diluted in which a reaction occurs ; the di@@ lution is calculated solely by volume of blood cells in the total volume .

the World Health Organisation has been specified for anti @-@ D and anti @-@ D re@@ agents for blood @-@ group determination of international standards , and for re@@ agents of other speci@@ fic@@ ity are lab@@ elled at the time standards .
according to definition , an international standard contains a specific number of units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the tit@@ ers who are observed in individual preparations for red blood cells ( 1 ) .
( 1 ) The effectiveness of re@@ agents to blood @-@ group determination of most speci@@ als is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ ites , which is observed in a series of th@@ inks in a ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te flood .
the Tit@@ les gives the di@@ lution of the Re@@ ag@@ enz@@ es in the last mix within a series , at which a micro@@ scop@@ ic visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
the effectiveness of the re@@ agents for blood @-@ group determination are present ( at the time anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in complete anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed in the basis of the title of unknown re@@ agents in international units ( See Bulletin der O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 301 . ) .

if a result is stored under the manufacturer recommended by the manufacturer , its required properties will remain at least one year .
the exp@@ iry date of a reduction in flu@@ ent form is at the most satisfactory one year after the last satisfactory activity .
this is based on the label of dry re@@ agents , according to the results of the holding fe@@ asi@@ bility : it is part of the state supervisory authorities .
dry re@@ agents are kept in a atmosphere of in@@ dem@@ able gas or in a vacuum , in which they have been dried up and that can be shut up in that way .
a dry asc@@ ending may not lose maximum 0.5 % of its weight if it is tested by further drying over phosphate pent@@ ines at a pressure of no more than 0,@@ 02 mm Hg within 24 hours .
for avoid@@ ance of bacter@@ ic@@ ien@@ cies , the competent authority may determine whether the reag@@ ent ( or those delivered with the dry re@@ agents delivered ) an ant@@ is@@ ep@@ tics and / or anti@@ bi@@ otic substance continues to keep the requirements for speci@@ fic@@ ity and efficacy .
sera human origin to blood @-@ group determination must contain at least 2.5 mg protein nitrogen per ml of flu@@ ent or dissolved ser@@ um .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the international exchange of re@@ agents to the blood @-@ group determination should not be colored , at least as long as not until an international agreement has come about a uniform system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
re@@ agents to the blood @-@ group determination are contained in such ways , that this in a container is not only sufficient to perform tests with the unknown blood cells , but also to perform tests with positive and negative contro@@ vers@@ y blood cells .
it must be so big in a container , that the contents can be used to conduct efficacy tests in this protocol described in this protocol .
the manufacturers laboratory has all production levels and checks of the reag@@ ent to the blood @-@ group determination .
appropriate samples of all paid re@@ agents are to be used as long from the laboratory of laboratory , until some probability be assumed that the Char@@ ge is no longer used .
the re@@ agents of the re@@ agents can contain substances of human , animal , plant ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective proportion , the others are the necessary tools to rein@@ forcement and preservation of the stability .
for technical reasons these re@@ agents are divided into three groups according to the origin of their effective part .
this means not that the re@@ agents of human origin contain exclusively substances of human origin or that animal or herbal re@@ agents cannot contain substances of human origin .
on each individual container , a black printed label is available in English and French , the following information includes : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ,
