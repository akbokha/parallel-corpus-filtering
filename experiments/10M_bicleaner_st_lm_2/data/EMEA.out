Ab@@ ili@@ fy is used for the treatment of severe episodes and to prevent man@@ ic episodes in patients who have applied to the medicine in the past .
injection solution is used for fast control of increased un@@ rest or behavi@@ oral disorders , if the oral consumption of the drug is not possible .
both diseases can be used to remove or the melting tablets in patients may have difficulties .
in patients receiving other medicines at the same time , the same as Ab@@ ili@@ fy should be adapted to the dose of Ab@@ ili@@ fy .
this imp@@ airs the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter , &quot; i.e. chemical substances which enable communication of ner@@ ve cells each .
Ari@@ ep@@ raz@@ ole appears especially as &quot; partial ag@@ onist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amin ( also called ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in ) .
this means that Ari@@ ip@@ yl@@ benzene like 5 @-@ Hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amin and d@@ op@@ amine , but in less dimensions as the ne@@ ural ran@@ s@@ itter works to activate the recept@@ ors .
da D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ Hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amin with sch@@ izophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , carries a role in norm@@ alize the activity of brain , which will reduce psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and their re@@ occur .
the effectiveness of Ab@@ ili@@ fy , to prevent the symptoms of symptoms , was investigated in three studies over a year .
the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared to 8@@ 05 patients with sch@@ izophren@@ ia or similar diseases , compared to a period of two hours with a placebo .
in another study , Ab@@ ili@@ fy was administered over twelve weeks of 347 patients with hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l , in another study the efficacy of Ab@@ ili@@ fy and placebo which had been stabil@@ ized on 160 patients with which the man@@ ic symptoms were stabil@@ ized with Ab@@ ili@@ fy .
the efficacy of Ab@@ ili@@ fy In@@ jection solution was compared to 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , which suffered from Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies the change of symptoms of patients were investigated using a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who talked to the treatment .
in addition , the company also led studies to investigate how the body makes the hot tab@@ let@@ ten and the solution to take up ( decreases ) .
in both studies with injection solution showed patients who received ab@@ ili@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9,@@ 75 mg or 15 mg were significantly stronger un@@ rest than the patient who received a placebo .
in the application for the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder reduced Ab@@ ili@@ fy in four of five short @-@ time studies and more effective than placebo .
Ab@@ ili@@ fy prevented for up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo in previously treated episodes with previously treated patients and when it was administered in addition to an existing treatment .
Ab@@ ili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses reduced also effective than placebo the symptoms increased , and were similar to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common adverse events of Ab@@ ili@@ fy ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extra@@ pyr@@ am@@ idal distur@@ ban@@ ces ( so@@ vereig@@ n@@ ty ) , squ@@ ad ( so@@ vereig@@ n@@ ty ) , salt water ( so@@ vereig@@ n@@ ty ) , salt water ( increased memory production ) , ti@@ red@@ ness ( increased memory production ) , ti@@ red@@ ness ( so@@ vereig@@ n@@ ty ) , ti@@ red@@ ness ( so@@ vereig@@ n@@ ty ) , ti@@ red@@ ness ( so@@ aking production ) , ti@@ red@@ ness ( so@@ vereig@@ n@@ ty ) , ti@@ red@@ ness ( so@@ vereig@@ n@@ ty ) , ti@@ red@@ ness ( so@@ vereig@@ n@@ ty ) , ti@@ red@@ ness ( so@@ vereig@@ n@@ ty ) , ti@@ red@@ ness ( so@@ vereig@@ n@@ ty ) , ti@@ red@@ ness ( so@@ vereig@@ n@@ ty ) , ti@@ red@@ ness ( so@@ aking production ) , ti@@ red@@ ness ( so@@ vereig@@ n@@ ty ) , ti@@ red@@ ness ( so@@ vereig@@ n@@ ty ) , ti@@ red@@ ness ( so@@ vereig@@ n@@ ty ) , ti@@ red@@ ness ( so@@ vereig@@ n@@ ty ) , ti@@ red@@ ness ( so@@ vereig@@ n@@ ty ) , ti@@ red@@ ness ( so@@ vereig@@ n@@ ty ) , ti@@ red@@ ness ( so@@ aking production ) , ti@@ red@@ ness ( so@@ vereig@@ n@@ ty ) , ti@@ red@@ ness ( so@@ vereig@@ n@@ ty ) , ti@@ red@@ ness ( so@@ vereig@@ n@@ ty ) , ti@@ red@@ ness ( so@@ vereig@@ n@@ ty ) , ti@@ red@@ ness ( so@@ vereig@@ n@@ ty ) , ti@@ red@@ ness ( so@@ vereig@@ n@@ ty ) , ti@@ red@@ ness ( so@@ aking production ) , ti@@ red@@ ness ( so@@ vereig@@ n@@ ty ) , ti@@ red@@ ness ( so@@ vereig@@ n@@ ty ) , ti@@ red@@ ness ( so@@ vereig@@ n@@ ty ) , ti@@ red@@ ness ( so@@ vereig@@ n@@ ty ) , ti@@ red@@ ness ( so@@ vereig@@ n@@ ty ) , ti@@ red@@ ness ( so@@ aking production ) , ti@@ red@@ ness ( so@@ vereig@@ n@@ ty ) , ti@@ red@@ ness ( so@@ vereig@@ n@@ ty ) , ti@@ red@@ ness ( so@@ vereig@@ n@@ ty ) , ti@@ red@@ ness ( so@@ vereig@@ n@@ ty ) , ti@@ red@@ ness ( so@@ vereig@@ n@@ ty ) , ti@@ red@@ ness ( so@@ vereig@@ n@@ ty ) , ti@@ red@@ ness ( so@@ aking production ) , ti@@ red@@ ness ( so@@ aking production ) , ti@@ red@@
the Committee for Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Ab@@ ili@@ fy in the treatment of sch@@ izophren@@ ia and from moder@@ ately serious episodes in patients who were mainly man@@ ic episodes on the treatment with Ari@@ ip@@ ra@@ ole , compared to the risks .
in addition , the Committee came to the result that the benefits of injection solution in patients with sch@@ izophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in patients with sch@@ izophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes when an oral therapy is not suitable , compared to the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission announced the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd . a approval for the placing on the placing of Ab@@ ili@@ fy in the entire European Union .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is for the treatment of a heavy episodes of the B@@ ip@@ ol@@ ar @-@ I@@ - disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes on the treatment with Ari@@ ip@@ ra@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day with a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
an increased effectiveness in doses above a daily dose of 15 mg was not detected , although single patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 15 mg once a day , regardless of meals as Mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the effectiveness of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y in the treatment of sch@@ izophren@@ ia and B@@ ip@@ ol@@ ar @-@ I@@ - disorder in patients ≥ 65 years was not detected .
with respect to the greater sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initi@@ al@@ dose should be considered to be considered if clinical factors are just@@ ify these factors ( see section 4.4 ) .
if the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is set out of combination therapy , the arith@@ met@@ a dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
the occurr@@ ence of su@@ preme behavior is reported to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ec@@ tives and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after an anti@@ psych@@ otic treatment , also in treatment with Ari@@ ip@@ ra@@ zol ( see section 4.8 ) .
results of epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar distur@@ b@@ ance there was no increased Su@@ icide risk with Ari@@ ip@@ ra@@ ole compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ica .
Ari@@ ip@@ ra@@ zol should be used with cau@@ tion in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ hydr@@ ation disease , mal@@ treatment disorders ) , cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular diseases , conditions for hyp@@ ot@@ onia pre@@ di@@ spon@@ ges ( including acute drug ) or hyper@@ tension ( including acute and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) .
3 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sc@@ esia : clinical trials which lasted a year or less digest@@ ed , there were occ@@ asi@@ onal reports about during the treatment with Ari@@ ip@@ ra@@ ole gu@@ ised Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esis .
if using an AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y treated patients and symptoms of a late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esis , should be taken into consideration , to reduce the dose or treatment .
if a patient has developed signs and symptoms that have a m@@ ns , or un@@ clear a fever without any additional clinical manifest@@ ation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics must be depos@@ ed , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
therefore Ari@@ ip@@ ol@@ ole should be used in patients with cr@@ amp@@ lif@@ es in the an@@ am@@ ity or in states that are used with cr@@ amp@@ lif@@ es in connection with cau@@ tion .
56 - 99 years old ) with Ari@@ ip@@ ra@@ zol in patients with psych@@ oses are associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ ip@@ ra@@ ole , an elevated risk of death in comparison to placebo .
however , in one of these studies , a study of fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the response to un@@ wanted cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events with Ari@@ as treated patients .
hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia , in some cases extrem@@ ly and associated with k@@ eto@@ azi@@ de or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em Com@@ a or death , was reported in patients who have been treated with atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic substances , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
there are no exact risk assessment for hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia @-@ related adverse events with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y and other atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic substances treated patients who allow direct compar@@ isons .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ph@@ ant@@ y , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in terms of glucose levels .
a weight gain is generally known for healthy patients and in patients with bi@@ polar Man@@ ie because of com@@ or@@ bi@@ dity , the application of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ika , in which weight gain is observed , or an un@@ healthy lifestyle , and could lead to serious comp@@ lications .
due to the primary effect of Ari@@ ip@@ ra@@ ole on the central nervous system , cau@@ tion when Ari@@ ip@@ ra@@ zol is used in combination with alcohol or other centrally centr@@ alized drugs such as se@@ dation ( see section 4.8 ) .
the H2 @-@ ant@@ ag@@ onist Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ ine , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of arith@@ met@@ a , but this effect is not relevant as clin@@ ically ir@@ relevant .
in a clinical study with healthy volunteers , a highly effective CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Chin@@ id@@ in ) increased by 107 % while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
it is expected to expect other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ x in and par@@ ox@@ et@@ in , similar effects and therefore , similar can be made can be made .
CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; Po@@ or &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ ism can result the common application with high @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 compared to CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 extensive metast@@ asis .
if you consider the common gift of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other high @-@ effective CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , the potential for potential risks of potential risks in patients .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV protein inhibit@@ ors , could be similar to similar effects and therefore , similar can be made can be made .
after setting the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6- or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dose of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be increased to the Dos@@ ish@@ level prior to the beginning of the accompanying therapy .
Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram or CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 together with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y can be administered jointly with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
in clinical studies showed doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg arith@@ met@@ ro@@ benzene per day no significant effect on metabolism of the sub@@ str@@ ates of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( War@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( War@@ far@@ le@@ zol ) and 3@@ A4 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) .
patients should be used to notify their doctor if pregnant or pregnant or pregnancy during the treatment with Ari@@ ip@@ ra@@ ole .
due to the in@@ adequate data situation in humans and due to the re@@ productive studies in pregnancy , this medication may not be applied in the pregnancy , unless the benefits just@@ i@@ fies the potential risk for the F@@ öt@@ us .
however , with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ica , patients should be warned against hazardous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are sure that Ari@@ ip@@ ra@@ ole has no negative influence on them .

in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time study ( 24 h ) with 291 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as ag@@ ility and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , was associated with a statistically significant improvement in symptoms regarding aggression and similar problems compared to placebo and similar to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm .
the observed intermediate improvement from the initial value on the P@@ AN@@ SS exc@@ it@@ ement Component score with the primary 2 @-@ hour final point was 5.8 for placebo , 9,6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8,7 for Ari@@ ip@@ ra@@ ole .
in analyses of sub @-@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe ag@@ iti@@ oning , a similar efficacy in relation to the total population was observed , but a statistical significance was determined due to a reduced patient number .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) with positive or negative symptoms showed a statistically significant improvement in psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
in one half @-@ controlled study , 52 % of the response of the response of patients who used a response to study medication were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ ip@@ ra@@ zol 77 % ( oral ) and hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l 73 % ) .
current values from Mess@@ r@@ als , which were defined as secondary degree rates , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ gom@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg de@@ compression scale , showed significantly stronger improvements than hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study about 26 weeks in stabil@@ ized patients with chronic sch@@ izophren@@ ia showed a significantly higher reduction in response rate that was 34 % in the arith@@ met@@ ic ( oral ) group and 57 % under placebo .
in a Ol@@ anz@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multin@@ ational double @-@ blind study at Sch@@ izophren@@ ia ( N = 18 or 13 % of balanced patient rates ) significantly fewer patients showed a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of approx . 5.6 lbs ) .
111 In a placebo @-@ controlled study about 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a B@@ ip@@ ol@@ ar @-@ I inter@@ mitt@@ ance , with or without psych@@ otic features , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ ip@@ ra@@ zol revealed an over@@ le@@ gen@@ ic effectiveness in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to Mon@@ otherapy with lithium or Val@@ pro@@ at .

the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a main study that took part in the 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which about three quarters were previously an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole gift or as Mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el pharmac@@ euticals ( given in combination with other medicines for the reduction of side effects ) .
all in all , in the main study 72 ( 31 % ) the 229 with Abra@@ x@@ ane treated patients on the treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 patients , conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el contained drugs .
looking at only the patients who were treated for the first time in metastatic breast cancer , there were no difference between the efficacy of the disease and survival .
in contrast , in patients who had previously received other treatments of metastatic breast cancer , in relation to these indicators it is more effective than conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el contained drugs .
it may also not be used in patients who have low st@@ oves or in front of the treatment of low neut@@ rop@@ hil@@ en@@ ants in the blood .
the Committee for Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) noted that the first treatment was no longer included , more effective than conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el contained drugs , in contrast to other P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el medic@@ inal products must not be given to other medicines , to reduce side effects .
in January 2008 , the European Commission announced an approval for placing on the market of Axel x@@ ane throughout the European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ Mon@@ otherapy is inde@@ xed for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients where the first @-@ line therapy for metastatic disease is failed , and for which a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ contained therapy is not displayed ( see also section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ enia ( Neut@@ rop@@ hil@@ en@@ count &lt; 0,50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sens@@ ory Neurop@@ ath@@ y during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 period .
when sens@@ ory neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ y degrees 3 , treatment is to be broken up until an improvement of degrees 1 or 2 is reached , and with all subsequent cycles , the dose must be reduced .
there are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of Dos@@ is@@ adap@@ tations in patients with mild to regular impair@@ ment of liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .

the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by 106 patients in two single @-@ blind studies and of 4@@ 54 patients who were treated in a randomised phase III case study .
in a study 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an infusion in about 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as infusion in about 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this multi @-@ ec@@ centric study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer patients with metastatic breast ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 as 3 @-@ hour infusion with relief for the prevention of an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 minute infusion without pre@@ medication ( N = 229 ) .

this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed a biological drug is similar to the European Union ( EU ) , which contains the same active substance ( also called &quot; reference arz@@ az@@ er &quot; ) .
in case of patients with normal blood pressure values , in connection with blood trans@@ fusion could not occur , if a blood loss is not possible , and with which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected .
treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be conducted among the supervision of a physician , experience in the treatment of patients with diseases , for which the medicine is indicated .
in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to leave a self @-@ ble@@ eding , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a v@@ ein .
injection can also be made from the patient or their car@@ n@@ urs@@ or , if they receive a reasonable guide .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suff@@ iciency or in patients receiving chemotherapy should always be in recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter with adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron values of all patients are to control the treatment to ensure that there is no iron defic@@ iency , and iron supplements should be administered during the entire treatment .
in patients who received chemotherapy or chemotherapy in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia can be caused by a ery@@ th@@ rop@@ oi@@ et@@ in@@ man@@ gel or therefore that the body is not sufficient for the body &apos;s own ery@@ th@@ rop@@ oi@@ et@@ in .
Er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ oi@@ et@@ in is also applied to operations in order to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reducing the consequences of blood loss .
it is produced by a cell that was introduced to a gene ( DNA ) which it has been added to the formation of ep@@ och@@ et@@ in al@@ fa .
Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared to the administration as injection in a main study with 479 patients suffering from kidney problems caused by ren@@ al problems caused by reference to reference problems .
at least eight weeks of patients receiving E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o were inj@@ ected into a v@@ ein before they have either been re@@ amed or continued E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
major inde@@ b@@ ator for the efficacy was the change of hem@@ ic@@ glo@@ binary values between the beginning of the study and the evaluation period in weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also laid the results of a study in which the effects of under the skin were investigated by E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o at 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy .
in the study with patients who had suffered from kidney problems caused by kidney problems , the hem@@ mo@@ glo@@ bin@@ s of patients who were killed on Ab@@ se@@ amen were treated like those of those patients who continue to get E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
compared to this , the patients showed continued E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o , an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common adverse effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is a rise of blood pressure , occasionally to sympt@@ om of a bovine spongiform encephalopath@@ y ( brain problems ) such as sudden , st@@ ating mig@@ rant head@@ ache and confusion .
Ab@@ se@@ amen may not be used in patients who may be over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against ep@@ och@@ et@@ in al@@ fa or one of the other components .
Ab@@ se@@ amed as injection under the skin is not recommended for the treatment of kidney problems , as other studies are necessary to ensure that no allergic reactions are triggered .
at the conclusion , the Committee of Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the medicine has been noted that the medicine has been a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company , the Ab@@ se@@ amed , is prepared for the medical staff in all Member States information , including information on the safety of the drug .

an increase in hem@@ og@@ glo@@ bin@@ s by more than 2 g / dl ( 1,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) should be avoided over a period of four weeks .
due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ ic@@ glo@@ bin@@ ds can be observed or under the hem@@ line @-@ target concentration .
in view of this hem@@ line vari@@ ability , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentrations should be tried by 10 g / dl ( 6,2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .

A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is used for the treatment of the following diseases : • oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease which makes the bone ) both in women after the years and in men .
in patients with a high fra@@ c@@ tive risk ( bone break@@ through@@ s ) , including patients who recently have suffered a lower traum@@ atic hat@@ ch like the bone ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get the bone , a disease that changed the normal course of the bone @-@ awak@@ ening .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with hip t@@ inc@@ ture should be given a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) oral or by injection into a muscle .
the administration of Par@@ ac@@ et@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means against inflamm@@ ation ) shortly after the application of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a may reduce the symptoms , such as fever , muscle pain , gri@@ pp@@ e@@ similar symptoms , joint pain and head@@ ache .
in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a may only be prescribed by doctors that have experience in the treatment of this disease .
since the active ingre@@ dient in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is like in Z@@ ometric , a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used to assess A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a .
in the first study , almost 8 000 older women with oste@@ opor@@ osis was involved , and the number of ver@@ te@@ br@@ al and hi@@ ps structures were examined over a period of three years .
the second study comprised 2 127 male and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years , who recently had a hip t@@ inc@@ ture , the number of fra@@ c@@ tures were examined over a period of up to five years .
at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was tested in two studies involving 357 patients and compared with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) for six months .
main inde@@ b@@ ator for the efficacy was the content of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in ser@@ um ( an enzyme that de@@ fied the bone structure ) in the blood back to at least 75 % compared to the initial value .
in the study with older women , the risk of ver@@ te@@ au@@ c@@ tures were reduced by 70 % over a period of three years compared to placebo below placebo .
compared to all patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis medicine ) , with those below placebo was reduced by 41 % .
in the study involving men and women with hip t@@ inc@@ ture had 9 % of patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a a Fra@@ ktur ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to placebo ( 139 from 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most side effects of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a occur within the first three days after the infusion and are less frequently .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a may not be used in patients who may be over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or one of the other components .
as for all bis@@ phosph@@ ates are subject to patients at A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a the risk of kidney disease , reactions to the infusion of kidney disease ( ab@@ die of bone tissue ) in a pine .
the manufacturer of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a represents recon@@ n@@ aissance materials for physi@@ cians , which contains A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , as well as similar material for patients who explains the adverse events of the drug and to apply when they would like to contact the doctor .

for treating post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men , an intraven@@ ous infusion of 5 mg of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended once a year .
in patients with a low @-@ traum@@ atic hip t@@ inc@@ ture , administration of the infusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a two or more weeks after the operating supply of the hip t@@ inc@@ ture ( see section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a should only be prescribed by doctors that have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
after treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , a long run@@ down period was observed in patients ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is very advis@@ able to ensure a sufficient supply of calcium , corresponding to at least 500 mg of elem@@ ental calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recent low @-@ traum@@ atic hil@@ ly inc@@ ture is recommended to an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 i.e. oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D before the first A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a infusion .
the frequency of symptoms that occur within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , can be reduced by Par@@ ac@@ et@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a .
patients with kidney degra@@ dation ( see section 4.4 ) In patients with an cre@@ at@@ ine cle@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended because limited clinical experiences of this patient group .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose custom@@ ization is not necessary because the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination with older patients are similar to younger patients .
children and yo@@ ungst@@ ers A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended for the application of children and adolescents under 18 years of age , because data is missing .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) not recommended because this patient population is limited only limited clinical experiences .
prior to the beginning of the therapy with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a to treat calcium and vitamin D with a sufficient supply of calcium and vitamin D ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to the quick integration of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on the bone structure , a temporary hypo@@ cr@@ aters can develop , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.8 ) .
in addition , it is very advis@@ able to ensure a sufficient supply of calcium , corresponding to at least 500 mg of elem@@ ental calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .

kidney @-@ disorder Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid was associated with kidney dysfunction , i.e. a decrease of the ren@@ al function ( i.e. an increase of the ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases than acute kidney failure .
the change of cre@@ at@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance ( measured before administration ) and the appearance of kidney failure in a clinical study was comparable to oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years similar between the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a- and the placebo group .
a temporary increase in the ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days of gift was observed at 1.8 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treated patients compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with placebo .
based on the evaluation of the laboratory tests the temporary as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic calcium carbonate ( less than 2,@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , in 2.3 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in a large clinical study treated patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get @-@ Studien .
all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study for post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis in the study on avoid@@ ance of clinical trials following a hip t@@ inc@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) .
in the study on preventing clinical trials , the vitamin D mirror were not rout@@ in@@ ely measured , however , the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D in front of the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
local reactions after administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in a large clinical study was reported on local reactions to the infusion center , such as tube , sw@@ elling and / or pain , reported ( 0.7 % ) .
oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sen in the pine fields , mainly with cancer patients , over oste@@ o@@ ek@@ ro@@ sen ( primarily in the jaw area ) reported by bis@@ phosph@@ ates , including z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid , were treated .
many of these patients had characters for local infections including oste@@ opath@@ itis , and the majority of reports rel@@ ates to cancer patients according to Zah@@ nex@@ er@@ ections or other dental handles .

treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a reduced by 30 % compared to the initial value and was kept at 28 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial income after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the output period up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
the vitamin D mirror were not rout@@ in@@ ely measured , but the majority of the patients received a initial dose of vitamin D ( 50.000 to 12@@ 5,000 i.e. oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular ) 2 weeks before infusion .
the total mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a group , compared with 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) in the HOR@@ IZ@@ ON @-@ RF@@ T study increased the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treatment compared to placebo treatment the BM@@ D in total and scissors to all time points .
the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treatment led over 24 months in comparison to placebo treatment for an increase of BM@@ D by 5.4 % in total and 4.3 % at the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ as .
clinical efficacy in men in the HOR@@ IZ@@ ON @-@ RF@@ T study analyzed 508 males , and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was judged after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical trials in men ; the incidence of clinical trials was 7.5 % at A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treated men compared to 8.7 % when compared to placebo .
in another study in men ( Study CZ@@ O@@ L@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 23@@ 08 ) , once an annual administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was included in comparison to the percentage change in the lum@@ bar code BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the initial value .
clinical efficacy of the treatment at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone of the bone was investigated in patients and patients at the age of 30 years ( median ser@@ um mirror of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ orus according to 2,@@ 6@@ fold up to 3,@@ 0@@ fold age @-@ specific upper value at the study ) .
11 The effectiveness of an infusion of 5 mg Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid compared to the consumption of 30 mg of ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at once a day for 2 months was detected in two six @-@ month comparative studies .
in the combined results , a similar decrease of pain and pain influenced in comparison to the output value for A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at was observed .
patients who were classified by the end of the six months study as Respon@@ sible ( for therapy ) were included in a follow @-@ up phase .
of the 143 with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and the 107 with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate patients treated at the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic approach could be obtained from 141 of patients with risk @-@ treated patients , maintaining a mean duration of the follow @-@ up period of 18 months after application .
one @-@ time and multiple @-@ time 5 and 15 minutes continuous in@@ fu@@ sions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid with 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ et@@ etic data that proved to be dos@@ is@@ independent .
the plasma tor@@ rent rapidly increased from &lt; 10 % of the maximum value to 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long lasting phase very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value .

to the following table ( Table 1 ) showing the treatment of adverse events in placebo @-@ controlled trials , which were treated for weight reduction and due to accompanying metab@@ olic diseases .
if the incidence was statistically significantly higher than the corresponding adverse reactions ( for un@@ wanted effects of 1 % ) or when they were clin@@ ically ir@@ relevant ( for un@@ wanted effects &lt; 1 % ) . NG In case of evaluation of side effects , the following number of adverse events are basically done :
very frequent ( ≥ 10 % ) ; commonly ( ≥ 0.1 % ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 0.1 , &lt; 1 % ) ; rare ( ≥ 0,01 ) , &lt; 0,1 % ) ;
in a toler@@ ability study , in which a limited number of persons covers up to 300 mg were given , only slight symptoms were observed .

5.3 Clinical data on security he had been observed in clinical studies that were not observed in clinical trials , but were identified as relevant for clinical use as possibly as relevant for clinical use :
in some cases , however , not in all cases , the beginning of the con@@ vul@@ sions have to be connected with un@@ conditional stress such as dealing with the animals .
Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant was given over a longer period before the match ( 9 weeks ) which allowed an recovery of the initial effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant , so no adverse effects were observed on the fertil@@ ity or cycle dysfunction .
the influence of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant on preventive and post@@ nat@@ al development was investigated at the rat in doses of up to 10 mg / kg / day .
in a study on rats and post@@ n@@ atal@@ ity development , a exposition associated with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in uter@@ o and using l@@ act@@ ate no changes in learning behaviour or memory .

summary of the EP@@ AR to the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EP@@ AR ) , in which is explained as the Committee for Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) , in order to analy@@ ze recommendations concerning the application of the drug .
Ac@@ counts is used for treatment of type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ ins@@ ulin dependent diabetes ) , where met@@ form@@ in ( a di@@ abet@@ ic medication ) can not be applied . • It can be used together with another di@@ abet@@ ic medicine ( du@@ al@@ therapy ) .
in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( in particular , overweight patients ) can not be applied with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest possible dose .
in combination with a sul@@ fur lining or ins@@ ulin , the previous dose of Sul@@ fon@@ yl treatment or ins@@ ulin can be retained , except for patients with hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ tic leu@@ ka@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; this should be reduced to the dose of Sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ resin and ins@@ ulin .
this means that the body &apos;s own ins@@ ulin is better util@@ ized and the blood sugar levels sin@@ ks , which means that type 2 diabetes can be better .
in more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of Ac@@ tos in Tri@@ ple@@ therapy was investigated ; patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fon@@ har@@ n@@ atives , in addition , they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3.5 years .
in the studies , the concentration of a substance was measured in blood ( gly@@ cer@@ y@@ li@@ zed hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) , which shows how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tos lead to a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c @-@ value , which rel@@ ate that blood sugar levels were reduced from 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg .
at the end of the Tri@@ ple@@ al therapy , the effect of an additional gift of Ac@@ tos in the existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sulph@@ ide resin in a reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values by 0,@@ 94 % , while the additional gift of placebo led to a decrease of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study , in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and ins@@ ulin had investigated in 289 patients , investig@@ ating the Ac@@ tos in addition to ins@@ ulin , a decrease of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values by 0,@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared to placebo in addition to placebo .
the most common adverse events related to Ac@@ tos were tend@@ encies , infections of the upper re@@ spir@@ atory infections , weight gain and hypo@@ thes@@ ia ( reduce sensitivity to friction ) .
Ac@@ counts may neither be used in patients who are possibly super@@ sensitive ( allergic ) compared to Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or one of the other components , even in patients with liver problems , cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency or di@@ abet@@ ic k@@ eto@@ ac@@ id@@ jan ( high level of K@@ et@@ on@@ spiegel - ac@@ idity @-@ level ) .
it was decided that Ac@@ tos in part of a mon@@ otherapy ( in sole use ) as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients may not be displayed in which met@@ form@@ in is not displayed .
in October 2000 , the European Commission announced the European Commission of Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited for placing on the market of Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union .
the tablets are white till white , round , curved and carry on one side the marking &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; AC@@ T@@ OS . &quot;
Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination with ins@@ ulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , with ins@@ ulin in@@ adequate and in@@ compatibility with which met@@ form@@ in due to contra@@ indications or in@@ compatibility ( see section 4.4 ) .
for the application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years of age , no data is available , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended .
in patients suffering from the presence of at least one risk factor ( e.g. previous heart attack or sy@@ mptom@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the physician should start the treatment with the lowest available dose and increase dosage .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency , weight gain or est@@ rogen , especially those with reduced car@@ di@@ al reserve .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of cardi@@ ac failure , weight gain and oil when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is used in combination with ins@@ ulin .
a cardiovascular out@@ comes trial with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and the existing advanced mak@@ rov@@ as@@ thma disease was carried out .
in this study an increase in reports about cardi@@ ac failure , which resulted in an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with increased output liver enzymes ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of standard range ) or with other signs of liver disease . Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one cannot be used .
if the AL@@ T mirror up to 3 times the upper limit of the standardi@@ zation are increased , the liver enz@@ ym@@ atic values are as soon as possible .
if one patient has developed symptoms , such as such an acute nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , surface damage , fatigue , appet@@ ite and / or dar@@ ker har@@ n , are the liver enz@@ ym@@ atic values .
the decision whether the treatment of patients with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one continued , should be re@@ directed to the evaluation parameters of clinical evaluation .
in clinical studies with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one has been demonstrated a dos@@ is@@ ance weight gain , which can be stir from fat deposits and in some cases linked to a liquid degree .
as a result of a Hä@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , a mar@@ gin@@ ally reduction in the middle hem@@ ic@@ glo@@ bin@@ s ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and the hem@@ at@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) .
similar changes were observed in patients with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ glo@@ bin@@ s by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ atology ( relative reduction in hem@@ og@@ glo@@ bin@@ s by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a result of increased ins@@ ulin @-@ ins@@ iti@@ vity in patients who received Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one as oral two or triple combination therapy with ins@@ ulin @-@ based chemotherapy with ins@@ ulin , the risk of dos@@ si@@ zing hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ k@@ emia .
after the market launch , under the treatment with Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ an , including Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , about an occurr@@ ence or deteri@@ oration of a di@@ abet@@ ic mac@@ ular mo@@ dems with a reduction of visual acuity .
it is un@@ clear whether there is a direct connection between taking Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and the occurr@@ ence of mac@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ de@@ men , but if patients report on dis@@ rup@@ tions of the visual acuity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ological En@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment should be considered .
in a summar@@ izing analysis of messages from random@@ ized , randomised controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one .
the calculated Fra@@ ktur incidence amounted to 1.9 Fra@@ tures per 100 patient years with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one treated women and 1.1 fra@@ c@@ tures for women who were treated with a comparative medication .
in the pro@@ active study , a study conducted over 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events that were treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one treated patients compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 fra@@ gment per 100 patients ) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication .
the patients shou@@ ldn &apos;t be aware of a pregnancy , and if a patient does a pregnancy wishes or those who enter , is the treatment ( see section 4.6 ) .
studies on investigation of inter@@ actions have shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one has no relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ et@@ etics or pharmaceutical dynamics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , phen@@ yl@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
interaction with pharmac@@ euticals , which are metab@@ oli@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contra@@ tiv@@ a , Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , cal@@ ci@@ um@@ can@@ al@@ blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ er are not expected .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zil ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8- In@@ hibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in AU@@ C by Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one by the 3 times .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 @-@ induc@@ tor ) resulted in a decrease of AU@@ C by Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one by 54 % .
this is due to due to the treatment with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one which reduces hyper@@ ins@@ ul@@ in@@ emia in pregnancy and increased ins@@ ulin resistance to the parent sub@@ str@@ ates and thereby reducing the availability of metab@@ olic sub@@ str@@ ates .
very frequent &gt; 1 / 10 ; commonly &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; rarely &gt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , single cases : unknown ( from this data is not estimated ) .
this lead to a temporary change of the tower and the refra@@ c@@ tive component of the lens , as also observed in other hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ cem@@ ic substances .
in clinical studies with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one came to placebo over the three times the upper limit of the standard range . however , more rarely than in comparative groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ resin .
in a out@@ comes study in patients with existing advanced mak@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease was the frequency of severe cardi@@ ac failure under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one by 1.6 % higher than in placebo when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one bz@@ w .
since the market launch , it has been reported about cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , however , if Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one has been used in combination with ins@@ ulin or in patients with cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency .
there was a summar@@ izing analysis of messages from randomised controlled trials , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one treated groups and over 7,@@ 400 patients treated with comparative medication treated .
in the over a period of 3.5 years of running pro@@ active study , Fra@@ tures were treated at 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one treated patients compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication .
during taking the maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , 180 mg / day over seven days there came no symptoms .
Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one seems to work on a activation of specific bu@@ ept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ation of Rec@@ ep@@ or g ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) ) , which leads to an elevated ins@@ ulin @-@ sensitivity of liver , fat and sk@@ el@@ etal mus@@ cular cells .
it could be shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduces glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral Glu@@ cos@@ ine ranking in case of ins@@ ulin @-@ resistant .
a clinical study with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d as Mon@@ otherapy was conducted over two years to investigate the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 treatment months ) .
at the time after two years after the beginning of therapy a blood sugar control was determined ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) by Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one at 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of patients treated below g@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study about 12 months , patients whose blood sugar were random@@ ized with ins@@ ulin @-@ ins@@ ulin to placebo was random@@ ized to Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or placebo .
in patients under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduced the average H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c - value by 0,@@ 45 % , compared to the patients who continued to do ins@@ ulin , a reduction of ins@@ ulin ass@@ ort@@ ation in the group treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one group .
in clinical studies over a year , under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one showed a statistically significant decrease of the album in / Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Qu@@ oti@@ ations compared to initial values .
the effect of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ( Mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was tested in a small , on 18 weeks of investig@@ ating type 2 di@@ abet@@ ic patients .
in most clinical trials , compared to placebo a reduction in plasma tri@@ gly@@ cem@@ eri@@ de and the free fatty acids and a rise of HD@@ L@@ - chol@@ ester@@ ol levels as well as slightly higher , but clin@@ ically not significantly increased LD@@ L@@ - chol@@ ester@@ ol levels observed .
in clinical studies over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduced compared to placebo , met@@ form@@ in or G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d the overall pl@@ as@@ yn@@ gly@@ cem@@ eri@@ de and the free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L chol@@ ester@@ ol levels .
compared to placebo was found no statistically significant increase in LD@@ L Chol@@ ester@@ in@@ spiegel , while under met@@ form@@ in and lic@@ en@@ zi@@ d decrease values were observed .
in a study about 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was not only the so@@ ber tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de , but also improved tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de mirror , this also improved tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de absorption , which can be used for both effect on the Tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de Absor@@ ption and the Tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de synthesis as well .
in the pro@@ active study , a cardi@@ ovascular out@@ comes study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre@@ existing advanced mac@@ ular disease in groups were random@@ ized to have received either Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years .
after oral application , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is quickly res@@ or@@ ated , with the peak concentration on un@@ changeable Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in plasma was usually reached 2 hours after application .
based on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV is equivalent to the efficacy of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , while resistant to the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II minimal .
in inter@@ ventions studies that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one could have no relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ et@@ etics or pharmaceutical dynamics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , phen@@ yl@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zil ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 @-@ inhibit@@ or ) increases or reduces plasma concentration of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ( see section 4.5 ) .
according to oral application of radio@@ active pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in humans the mark@@ er was found mainly in barrel ( 55 % ) and at a lower degree in Har@@ n ( 45 % ) .
the mean plasma @-@ Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ ic life of un@@ changeable Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is 5 @-@ 6 hours , and that of the active metabolism is at 16 - 23 hours .
the plasma concentrations of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and its metabol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function lower than in healthy volunteers , but the rates of oral cle@@ aring of the matern@@ ity is similar .
in tox@@ ic@@ ological studies performed with mice , rats , dogs and monkey , after repeated administration of plasma volume with hem@@ og@@ ni@@ versaries , an@@ emia and reversible c@@ ec@@ centric heart hyper@@ t@@ roph@@ ic .
this is due to be attributable to Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in the gest@@ ation of hyper@@ ins@@ ul@@ in@@ emia and increased ins@@ ulin resistance of the parent &apos;s disease and reduces the availability of metab@@ olic sub@@ str@@ ates for f@@ og@@ ni@@ al growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) , intra@@ ocular concentrations of hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( male and female rats ) were induced and tum@@ ours ( male rats ) of the ur@@ inary bladder epi@@ thel@@ ium .
in a animal model of the famil@@ y@@ om@@ at@@ ous poly@@ pos@@ is ( FA@@ P ) , the treatment with two other Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ces resulted in an increased frequency of col@@ ont@@ um@@ ors .
the tablets are white to wh@@ it@@ ish , round , flat and wear on one side the marking &quot; 30 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; AC@@ T@@ OS . &quot;
the calculated Fra@@ ktur incidence amounted to 1.9 Fra@@ tures per 100 patient years with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one treated women and 1.1 fra@@ c@@ tures for women who were treated with a comparative medication .
in the pro@@ active study , a study conducted over 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events that were treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one treated patients compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 fra@@ gment per 100 patients ) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication .
in another study more than two years the effects of a combination therapy was investigated using Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d .
in clinical trials over 1 year , under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one showed a statistically significant decrease of the album in / Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Qu@@ oti@@ ations compared to initial values .

Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane was given a total of 294 patients with type 1 diabetes , where the pan@@ cre@@ as is no ins@@ ulin , and type 2 diabetes , where the body is not able to use ins@@ ulin @-@ effective .
in the study , the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cer@@ y@@ li@@ zed hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , which shows how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane resulted in a decrease of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror which indicates that the blood sugar levels were similar to be reduced significantly as with another human ins@@ ulin .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients who are possibly super@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human@@ ins@@ ulin ( r@@ DNA ) or other components .
in addition , doses of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane may have to be adjusted , when it is administered along with a number of other medicines that can be eff@@ ected on blood sugar ( the full list is to remove the pack@@ ets ) .
at the end , the Committee of Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the benefits of ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane was in the treatment of diabetes from the risks of diabetes .
October 2002 , the European Commission announced the European Commission Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for placing on the market of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the entire European Union .
pre @-@ mixed ins@@ ulin products normally be applied once or twice daily , when a fast @-@ initial effect is used together with a longer lasting effect .
the injection needle must be kept at least 6 seconds under the skin to ensure that the entire dose is inj@@ ected .
patients whose blood glucose levels significantly improved by an intensive ins@@ ulin @-@ therapy , the hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ cem@@ ia warning sympt@@ om can perc@@ eive and should be advised .
any amendment to strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , ins@@ ulin type ( fast work , bi@@ @-@ phase ) , type of ins@@ ulin ( animal ins@@ ulin , human ins@@ ulin or ins@@ ulin @-@ dependent ) and / or manufacturing method ( due to re@@ combin@@ ant DNA against ins@@ ulin of animal origin ) can lead that a change of dosage is required .
if the change is required to ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the patient , it can be necessary for the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the conversion .
some patients who were hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ cem@@ ic reactions after a change of animal against human ins@@ ulin , reported that the early warning sympt@@ om of a hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ cem@@ ia were less pronoun@@ ced or unlike its previous ins@@ ulin .
before travelling , which should go over several time zones , the patient should bring it to the advice of his physician , as such journeys can be used , ins@@ ulin and meals must be applied to other times respectively .
the doctor must therefore consider the possible inter@@ actions of therapy and patients always ask for others to others by them .

Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id must not be used in patients who are possibly over@@ sensitive to ins@@ ulin human ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components .
in addition , doses of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id may have to be adjusted , when it is administered along with a number of other medicines that can act on blood sugar .
October 2002 , the European Commission announced the European Commission Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for placing on the market launch of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the entire European Union .
if two types of ins@@ ulin have to be mixed , first the amount of the rapidly @-@ acting ins@@ ulin has to be moved , then the amount of the long @-@ acting ins@@ ulin .
3 If the switch to ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id requires a dose custom@@ ization , it can be necessary for the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the conversion .
before travelling , which should go over several time zones , the patient should bring it to the advice of his physician , as such journeys can be used , ins@@ ulin and meals must be applied to other times respectively .

Aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients who have already applied signs of cryst@@ alli@@ ons , including arthritis ( pain and inflamm@@ ation in the joints ) or po@@ ison@@ ous ( &quot; stones &quot; i.e. bigger Ur@@ at@@ cryst@@ alline deposits , which can lead to joint and bone damage ) .
if the ur@@ inary acid is still more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter , the dose may be increased to 120 mg once a day .
during the first treatment months the patient can still occur . therefore , the patient &apos;s disease is recommended for at least during the first six months of treatment with Aden@@ ur@@ ic even further medicines for the prevention of po@@ ison@@ an@@ cies .
the medicine is not recommended in children and in patients who had an organ tran@@ splantation , because it was not investigated for these groups .
in the first study , in which 1 0@@ 72 patients participated , the efficacy of three different Aden@@ ur@@ ic doses ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared to placebo ( pseud@@ o @-@ medication ) and of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( a other medicines for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia ) .
in the second study , two doses of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each with Al@@ lo@@ purple .
in both studies Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was applied for 300 mg once daily ; patients with kidney problems were only 100 mg per day .
main inde@@ b@@ ator for the efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ inary acid levels was in blood during the last three measurements under 6 mg / dl .
in the first study 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) of patients who Aden@@ ur@@ ic within a dose of 80 mg of patients , and 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) of the patients who once a day is 120 mg , for the last three measurements take a ure@@ ure@@ ments in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl .
compared to this , this was 22 % ( 60 out of 268 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and no one of the 134 patients under placebo .
the most common adverse events of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ ache , di@@ arr@@ he@@ a , nau@@ sea ( Nau@@ sea ) , r@@ ash and abnormal liver values .
in particular , in patients with heart failure in pre@@ history , possibly a increased risk of certain adverse events that affect the heart and blood vessels .
at the conclusion , Aden@@ ur@@ ic came to the conclusion that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in the blood of the ur@@ inary tract in the blood , but it was also a higher risk of side effects in connection with the heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia in diseases which have already been led to urine ( including one from the medical story or current gi@@ raff@@ es and / or a gi@@ on@@ arthritis ) .
if the ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ ac@@ idity is still under 2 @-@ 4 weeks or more &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , can be considered a dose increase of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily .
in patients with severe kidney disease , the effectiveness and safety were not completely examined ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in@@ - Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see section 5.2 ) .

cardiovascular disease in patients with disease disease or de@@ compens@@ ated heart failure is not recommended ( see section 4.8 ) .
as with other hard @-@ acid medicines , it can occur during the beginning of treatment in a acute gi@@ raff@@ ia because of the lowering of the ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ ac@@ idity of the ur@@ inary deposits of the t@@ issues can be mobil@@ ized in t@@ issues .

liver disease during Phase 3 clinical studies of liver function@@ alities were observed with Feb@@ y@@ ost@@ at treated patients ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to perform a liver functional trial before the beginning of February ( see section 5.1 ) .
The@@ oph@@ yl@@ line Z@@ was conducted no interaction studies to Feb@@ .@@ ux@@ e@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O inhibit@@ ing can lead to a rise of the@@ oph@@ yl@@ line ( a inhibit@@ ing of the metabolism of the@@ oph@@ yl@@ line also reported to other X@@ O inhibit@@ or ) .
in subjects , the simultaneous gift of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen has been 250 mg 2 x daily with an increase in Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at@@ ement ( C@@ max 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) .

clinical study results The efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was shown in two P@@ iv@@ ot@@ al studies of Phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ act study as described below ) that were performed with 1.8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia and g@@ out .
the primary efficacy point was in any study of the proportion of patients , with which the last three month @-@ monthly ser@@ um levels were &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily ( n = 10 ) for patients with a ser@@ um incre@@ ment value to study starting from &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2,0 mg / dl per day .
the AP@@ EX study showed a statistically significant su@@ peri@@ ority between the treatment of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily as well as AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg / 100 mg daily ( n = 258 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ act study showed a statistically significant su@@ peri@@ ority relative to the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conventional use of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .

the lowering of the ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ acid level to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed at the physician attendance in week 2 and kept permanent over the whole treatment .
509 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with ser@@ um at@@ in@@ ine values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub @-@ group of patients with kidney limitation The AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy in 40 patients with kidney limitation ( d. h .
AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was achieved with the primary efficacy of 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of the patients .
there was no clin@@ ically significant differences in regard to the percentage decline of the ser@@ um @-@ acid concentrations in subjects , regardless of their kidney function ( 58 % in group with normal kidney function and 55 % in group with severe kidney disorders ) .
primary end@@ point in the lower group of patients with ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ acid concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl About 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and F@@ act study ) had a ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ ac@@ re@@ concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
in two years , data collected by the open extension study of the phase 3 showed that the permanent decrease of the ser@@ um level resulted in less than 3 % of patients in the months 16 @-@ 24 patients ( i.e. more than 97 % of the patients have no treatment against a tox@@ icity ) .
this was associated with a reduction in the tox@@ icity size , which at 54 % of patients had a complete disappearance of the tox@@ ins until month 24 .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease , in which the bones are used ) for women after men@@ op@@ ause , where a risk is made for a low vitamin D mirror .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or other medicines ( including Ant@@ azi@@ da , calcium and vit@@ amine supplement ) .
to avoid a irrit@@ ation of the meal , the patient may not take off after the first food intake of the day , the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
because Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate and vitamin D3 is already separated from each other in pharmac@@ euticals , the company was approved in the European Union , which origin@@ ate from previous studies and published literature .
the company also led a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to prove the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE regarding the increase of vitamin D mirrors .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients treated with low vitamin D levels in patients who had been treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 11 % ) than that of those who had taken care of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( 32 % ) .
furthermore , the company also laid data that the Al@@ end@@ ron dose contained exactly the dose which is needed for preventing a bone loss .
the most common adverse events ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ ache , pain of the mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal pain ( di@@ arr@@ he@@ ath ) , di@@ arr@@ he@@ a ( di@@ arr@@ he@@ ath ) , di@@ arr@@ he@@ a ( di@@ arr@@ he@@ ath ) , si@@ ze@@ es ( di@@ arr@@ he@@ ath ) , cr@@ ashes ( di@@ arr@@ he@@ ath ) , sp@@ ans ab@@ dom@@ en ( b@@ lown away ) , det@@ ach@@ able ab@@ dom@@ en ( blo@@ cked belly ) as well as aci@@ dic det@@ ach@@ ments .
in patients with auxiliary sensitivity ( allerg@@ y ) against Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at , vitamin D3 or other components may not be applied to AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
it may not be applied in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who can stand up for at least 30 minutes .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or take of pharmac@@ euticals ( including Ant@@ azi@@ da , calcium and vit@@ amine supplementary food ) for the day .
the following hin@@ ts are exact to reduce the risk of mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation and associated side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be swal@@ lowed up with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) in the mouth , as a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ zer@@ a exists . • The patients must not drop off before the first food intake of the day that should be carried out at the earliest after 30 minutes after taking the tablet .

the doctor may therefore attention to all signs and symptoms that are to be noted on possible mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation , such as Dy@@ na@@ ag@@ ie , pain when experien@@ cing symptoms or a new or retro@@ spec@@ ulation of So@@ d@@ burn to get the medicine and consult medical advice ( see section 4.8 ) .
3 The risk of serious adverse events seems to be increased in patients who do not include the medicine and / or after the occurr@@ ence of symptoms that refer to a mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge of irrit@@ ation .
it is very important that all doses are given to the patient and understood ( see section 4.2 ) .
during a large clinical studies with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at no increased risk , rarely ( after market launch ) Mag@@ i and Du@@ o@@ den@@ al@@ ul@@ zer@@ a , among them some severe characteristics and comp@@ lications , reported ( see section 4.8 ) .

the clinical assessment due to the previously untreated doctor is crucial for the treatment of any patient on the basis of an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the patients must be addressed to the intake of a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE the tablet in the next morning after you notice the dispatch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you should not take two tablets a day , but the intake of one tablet per week as originally planned on the scheduled week@@ day .
other diseases that affect the mineral metabolism ( like vitamin D defic@@ iency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) , should also be adequate at the beginning of therapy with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at foods and drinks ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines can imp@@ acted the res@@ or@@ ption of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at , when they are at the same time .
therefore , patients must wait at least 30 minutes after taking the Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at , before they take other medicines ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interest studies were not carried out , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was taken together with a variety of usually prescribed drugs , without having clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended only for application in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and therefore , neither during pregnancy , neither during pregnancy nor to apply .

C@@ agra@@ f is administered in adult patients to prevent a kidney or liver tran@@ spl@@ ant to prevent a shock of tran@@ spl@@ ant organ by the immune system .
since T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft has already been used in the EU , the company has presented the results from previously conducted studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft and data from the published literature .
furthermore , the results of a clinical study enrolled 6@@ 68 patients with kidney tran@@ splantation , whereby the application of C@@ agra@@ f with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or Cic@@ los@@ se was compared .
principal inde@@ b@@ ator of the efficacy was the number of patients with which the tran@@ spl@@ ant after a treatment duration of one year was filed ( by example , how often a new organ tran@@ spl@@ ant or a res@@ umption of di@@ aly@@ sis was needed ) .
in addition , further studies on 119 patients with kidney tran@@ splantation and 129 patients with liver tran@@ spl@@ ant were performed and examined how C@@ agra@@ f is absorbed as compared to pro@@ gra@@ f / pro@@ gra@@ ft of the body .

in patients with auxiliary sensitivity ( allerg@@ y ) against t@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , macro @-@ anti@@ biotics ( such as Er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in ) or one of the other components must not be applied .
patients and physi@@ cians must be c@@ auti@@ ous when other ( especially some vegetable ) medicines are taken at the same time with C@@ agra@@ f , as the recommended drug dose or the dose of the same medication should be adapted accordingly .

only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ ologic @-@ intensive therapy and the treatment of tran@@ spl@@ ant patients , should accept this medic@@ inal or changes in immun@@ oh@@ res@@ sive therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences of the system@@ ic exposition of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , this can lead to tran@@ spl@@ ants or an increased incidence of side effects , including sub or immun@@ oh@@ s .
patients always should always retain the same T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; re@@ orders of formulation or regime should only be performed under the tran@@ spl@@ ant control of one in tran@@ spl@@ ant medical instruments ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
as a result of a changeover to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic pharmaceutical monitoring and appropriate dose adap@@ tations , to ensure that the system@@ ic exposure of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us will remain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the dosage of Adv@@ ant@@ f should be primarily based on clinical evaluation of ab@@ hor@@ ism and toler@@ ability in detail and on blood @-@ reflective regulations ( see below &quot; recommendations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after conversion of Pro@@ gra@@ f on Adv@@ agra@@ f , the t@@ acro@@ lim@@ us valley should be controlled before the changeover and over two weeks after conversion .
on Day 4 , the system@@ ic exposition was measured as a valley mirror , with both formulation both in kidney and tran@@ splan@@ ted patients .
careful and repeated checks of the t@@ acro@@ lim@@ us valley level is recommended during the first two weeks after tran@@ splantation under Adv@@ ant@@ f , to ensure reasonable substance exposure in the immediate tran@@ spl@@ ant phase .
since T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with lower cle@@ ance , can take a adaptation of the Adv@@ oc@@ f @-@ Dos@@ is@@ schem@@ as for several days until the Ste@@ ady State is reached .
in case of the condition of patients in the first postoperative course , the acro@@ lim@@ us treatment can be administered intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate on the manufacture of an infusion solution ) with a dose of approx .
duration of the treatment for the suppression of tran@@ spl@@ ants must be kept ; consistent , therefore , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified .
dose recommendations - kidney tran@@ spl@@ ant proph@@ yla@@ xis of tran@@ spl@@ ant stimulation / oral Adv@@ ance therapy should begin with 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
further Dos@@ is@@ adap@@ tations can be later required , since the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etics of t@@ acro@@ lim@@ us can change during stabil@@ ization of patients after tran@@ splantation .
dose recommendations - liver tran@@ spl@@ ant proph@@ yla@@ xis of tran@@ spl@@ ant stimulation / oral Adv@@ ance therapy should begin with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
dosage recommendation - switch from Pro@@ gra@@ f on Adv@@ ant@@ f must be converted twice daily dosage of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules to a once daily intake of Adv@@ ant@@ f ( mg : mg ) , so the changeover in relation to the entire daily dose is to be carried out .
kidney and liver tran@@ spl@@ ant after a conversion of other immun@@ ity res@@ s@@ va on Adv@@ agra@@ f once daily must begin with the recommended initial initi@@ als for proph@@ yla@@ xis for proph@@ yla@@ xis of the tran@@ spl@@ ants .
heart tran@@ spl@@ ant for adult patients who are converted to C@@ agra@@ f , is a oral initial dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day a day once a day .
other tran@@ spl@@ ant receivers , though there are no clinical experience with C@@ agra@@ f in lun@@ atic , pan@@ cre@@ as and dar@@ m@@ tran@@ spl@@ ants in a oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and for intest@@ inal tran@@ spl@@ ants in a oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
Dos@@ is@@ adap@@ tations in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function for maintaining blood reflected in the target range can be necessary in patients with severe liver function .
patients with reduced ren@@ al function Da kidney function has no influence on pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ et@@ etics of t@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , can be assumed that a dose custom@@ ization is not necessary .
due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potenti@@ als of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , however , a careful monitoring of the ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of the ser@@ um incre@@ in@@ ine mirror , a calculation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine and a monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended .
conversion of Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in on Adv@@ ant@@ f With the conversion from a Cic@@ los@@ in@@ - to a t@@ acro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy is cau@@ tion ( see sections 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations to the valley level in full blood , the dose should be based on clinical assessment of shock absor@@ bing and toler@@ ability in individual cases under assignment of whole blood @-@ t@@ acro@@ lim@@ us @-@ valley inspec@@ tions .
it is recommended frequent controls of the t@@ acro@@ lim@@ us valley level during the first two weeks after tran@@ splantation , followed by periodi@@ c controls during maintenance therapy .
blood @-@ Tal@@ ents of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us should also be used after conversion of Pro@@ gra@@ f on Adv@@ agra@@ f , Dos@@ is@@ ance , changes to immun@@ ologic treatment or in simultaneous application of substances that could change the t@@ acro@@ lim@@ us full concentration ( see section 4.5 ) .
since C@@ agra@@ f is a medicine with a low cle@@ ance , the dose may require several days , until the Ste@@ ady State has occurred .
the data in clinical trials include that a successful treatment is possible in most cases , when the valley is not exceed 20 n@@ g / ml .
in clinical practice the valley mirror of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us usually lie in the first time after liver tran@@ spl@@ ants in the area of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and with kidneys and heart@@ ed patients at 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml .
during the subsequent maintenance of liver , kidney and cardi@@ ac tran@@ spl@@ ants were used usually in the range between 5 - 15 n@@ g / ml .
this has resulted in serious adverse events , including tran@@ spl@@ ants or other side effects , which can occur in a row of t@@ acro@@ lim@@ us sub@@ - or over@@ exposure .
patients always should always retain the same T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; re@@ orders of formulation or regime should only be carried out in the tran@@ spl@@ ant control of one in tran@@ spl@@ ant medical instruments ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
5 For the treatment of adult patients with tran@@ spl@@ ants , which proved to be treated with other immun@@ ity res@@ cu@@ va as a refra@@ c@@ tory , there are currently no clinical data for the ret@@ ardi@@ zed formulation of C@@ agra@@ f .
for proph@@ yla@@ xis of tran@@ spl@@ ant tran@@ spl@@ ant in adult heart tran@@ spl@@ ants and tran@@ spl@@ ant receivers , there are still no clinical data for the ret@@ ardi@@ zed formulation of the C@@ agra@@ f .
because of possible interaction , which can lead to a reduction of the t@@ acro@@ lim@@ ousine level in blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of t@@ acro@@ lim@@ us ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ ation ) included , or other plant healing during a treatment with C@@ agra@@ f ( see section 4.5 ) .
in patients with di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea is a particularly careful monitoring of the t@@ acro@@ lim@@ o concentrations in the blood because the acro@@ lim@@ us blood levels may be subject to adverse fluctu@@ ations under such circumstances .
in rare cases , under Pro@@ gra@@ f was considered as Kar@@ di@@ om@@ y@@ opath@@ y , aqu@@ eous hum@@ or hyper@@ t@@ rophy , which can also occur under Adv@@ ant@@ y .
further factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders , a treatment with cor@@ ost@@ ero@@ ids , hyper@@ tension , kidney or liver function , infections , liquid @-@ loading and oil .
as with other immun@@ ity res@@ cu@@ va the impact of sunlight or UV light should be restricted because of the possible risk of mal@@ ign@@ ant skin changes due to appropriate clothing or use of a solar protection by means of a high protective factor .
if patients who ut@@ ili@@ ze t@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , symptoms of pre@@ aches , changed awareness of consciousness , powers and tend@@ encies , should be a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g ) .
since C@@ agra@@ f hard capsules , ret@@ ardi@@ zed , l@@ act@@ ose is included in patients with the rare her@@ edit@@ ary of Gal@@ act@@ ose @-@ In@@ toler@@ ance , l@@ act@@ ose @-@ lack or glucose @-@ g@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption particular attention .
con@@ current use of medicines or herbal medic@@ ations , known as inhibit@@ or or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can reduce the metabolism of t@@ acro@@ lim@@ us and therefore reduce blood values of t@@ acro@@ lim@@ us or lower .
therefore it is recommended to change the t@@ acro@@ lim@@ us@@ - blood levels in the same gift of substances that can change the CY@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and to set the t@@ acro@@ lim@@ us dose for maintaining the same level ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) .

pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ et@@ ic@@ ate studies that the increase of blood levels mainly from the increased bio@@ availability of t@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , due to the inhibit@@ ing of the gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal failure , results in .
high @-@ performance pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as it is used in acute abl@@ ility actions , the concentration of t@@ acro@@ lim@@ us can increase or lower .
T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us effect on the metabolism of other medicines T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us is known as CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or ; therefore , the simultaneous application of t@@ acro@@ lim@@ us can be metab@@ oli@@ zed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , their metabolism will affect the metabolism .
since T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us reduce the cle@@ ance of ster@@ oid contra@@ diction and thus increase the hormon@@ al exposition , to make decisions about emp@@ iri@@ cal measures especially c@@ auti@@ ous .
the results of animal experiments have shown that t@@ acro@@ lim@@ us reduce the cle@@ ance of pent@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital and phen@@ az@@ one , and extend their half @-@ time .

Adv@@ ate is used for the treatment and prevention of blood disorders in patients with hem@@ oph@@ ilia A ( one by the lack of factor VIII , con@@ gen@@ ital blood distur@@ bing disorder ) .
the dosage and frequency of the application are then applied , whether it is applied for the treatment of ble@@ eding or the prevention of blood cells in surgical surgery .
patients with hem@@ oph@@ ilia A suffer from a factor VIII defic@@ iency , causing blood cl@@ auses such as ble@@ eding in joints , muscles or inner organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma but made in a method designed as &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology &quot; :
it is produced by a cell that was introduced to a gene ( DNA ) which it was authorized to formation of the human cl@@ utch factor VIII .
Adv@@ ate is similar to another in the European Union of Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ates , similar to that the medicine contains no proteins of human or animal origin .
in three additional studies of patients with severe to moderate hem@@ oph@@ ilia A , among them a study with 53 children under six years , the application of the drug was investigated for the prevention of ble@@ eding and surgical surgery .
in the main study , the efficacy of C@@ ate was awarded with &quot; excellent &quot; or &quot; good &quot; in the prevention of blood disorders in 86 % of 510 .
the most common adverse events of Adv@@ ate ( ob@@ serves 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ ache , py@@ rex@@ ie ( fever ) and the formation of anti@@ bodies against factor VIII .
Adv@@ ate can not be used in patients who may be over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against human cl@@ auses factor VIII , Maus@@ ole@@ um or Ham@@ ster@@ protein or one of the other components .
in March 2004 , the European Commission launched B@@ ax@@ ter AG approval for placing on the market of Adv@@ ices in the entire European Union .
dosage The dosage and duration of the sub@@ stit@@ uted therapy according to the sever@@ ity of factor VIII defic@@ iency , after the place and extent of the blood of blood and clinical state of the patient .
the following t@@ mor@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic events shall not drop by factor VIII activity in the appropriate period under the given plasma welding ( in % of the standard or in i.e. / dl ) .
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer repeat , until the pain and the acute impair@@ ment are removed .
injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat until the risk of the patient is over .
during treatment course , a reasonable dose and frequency of inj@@ ections was an appropriate determination of factor VIII plasma tor@@ ments .
individual patients can distinguish themselves in their reaction to factor VIII , varying in vi@@ vo recovery and have different half times .
3 proph@@ yla@@ xis For long @-@ term proph@@ yla@@ xis in patients with severe hem@@ oph@@ ilia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 i.e. by factor VIII per kg body weight at a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VIII plasma activities can not be achieved or if the blood is not ratified by a reasonable dose , a test must be carried out if necessary for an inhibit@@ or .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures must be performed .
the application rate is based on the approval of the patient , with a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
education of neutral anti@@ bodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a well @-@ known comp@@ lication in the treatment of patients with hem@@ oph@@ ilia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always against the pro@@ ko@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VIII to Ig@@ G Im@@ m@@ ung@@ lob@@ ul@@ ine , which are qu@@ anti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma with modified Beth@@ es@@ da Ass@@ ay .
the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors , cor@@ related with the extent of the exposure to the factor VIII , where the risk is dependent on the largest and other factors within the first 20 days .
in treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 working days and an@@ am@@ ne@@ ingly well @-@ known inhibit@@ or development was observed , after conversion from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII product to another , the repet@@ ition of ( minim@@ alist ) inhibit@@ ors observed .
due to the rare ess@@ ay of hem@@ oph@@ ilia A in women lie over the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and still no experiences .
during the largest number of patients , A@@ DR@@ s were in@@ inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) who had previously untreated patients who have previously untreated advanced risk of inhibit@@ ors , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) .
very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / € 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency on the basis of available data is not estimated ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated using the sum of the individual patients ( 234 ) . the unexpected drop of blood cl@@ as@@ ction factor VIII @-@ mirrors occurred post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 post@@ oper@@ atively day ) in a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ ATE infusion .
the blood cl@@ ash was held during the whole time and both the factor of V@@ II@@ I@@ - mirror in plasma and the cle@@ ance rate showed sufficient values on the 15th post@@ oper@@ atively day .
in clinical studies with A@@ DV@@ ATE on 145 children and adults 2 with diagnostic concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) , only one patient after 26 ex@@ positions with A@@ DV@@ ATE showed a low in@@ hibition ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in modified Beth@@ es@@ da approach ) .
in addition , there was none of the 53 pe@@ diat@@ ric patients with an age of 6 years and diagnostic he@@ avier up to moderate hem@@ oph@@ ilia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) according to the previous exposure to factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) a F@@ VIII inhibit@@ or .
previously untreated patients treated 5 out of 25 ( 20 % ) patients with A@@ DV@@ ATE treated patients inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII .
the immune response of patients on traces of contamination of contamination was analyzed by the investigation of the antibody tit@@ er against this proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects .
one patient showed both a statistically significant upward trend , as well as a persistent peak of anti @-@ Ch@@ o cells , otherwise there were no signs or symptoms related to an allergic reaction or a sensitivity .

based on the approval of all data , the CH@@ MP has already been rated as a positive result , but in regard to the safety profile of the following reasons , the safety profile has to be closely monitored :
therefore , the CH@@ MP based on the basis of the safety survey of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which makes a sub@@ mitting of P@@ SU@@ R@@ s every 6 months , decided that the approval owner shall apply for another 5 years .
in December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Molecular Limited issued the Committee for Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) officially announced that the company takes off his application for marketing to Mr. Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
normally , the breast , the brain , bones or soft@@ parts ( fabric , the other structures in the body are connected , and support ) of it .
this is a kind of virus , the genet@@ ically modified that it can bear a gene into the body &apos;s cells .
the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; Aden@@ ov@@ irus , &quot; which has been changed so that there cannot produce any copies of itself and therefore no infections can be redeemed when humans .
C@@ ex@@ in would have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ours and thus enable the cancer cells to form normal p@@ 53 @-@ protein .
the p@@ 53 @-@ protein , which is formed not damaged by the human body existing p@@ 53 gene , contributes normally to restore damaged DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA can not be recovered .
at Li @-@ women &apos;s cancer , the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 @-@ protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can grow up and share .
the company recorded data from a study with a patient , at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Cancer , in the field of construction , in bones and brain .
after the CH@@ MP &apos;s answers to the company had examined the questions , still some issues were un@@ explained .
based on the evaluation of the initially submitted documents the CH@@ MP has been generated on Day 120 a list of questions which will be sent to the company .
according to the CH@@ MP opinion , the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i tum@@ ours brings advantages to the patient .
the Committee also had concerns relating to the processing of the medicine in the body , the type of administration as well as the safety of the drug .
in addition , the company was not sufficient that Adv@@ ant@@ in can be manufactured in a reliable way , and that neither the environment nor for people who come in contact with the patient , is harmful .
the company put the CH@@ MP not to be aware of whether the withdrawal consequences for patients who are currently involved in clinical trials or &quot; comp@@ assi@@ on@@ ate use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; changing the material release &quot; means that the tablets are so composed that one of the effective components are immediately released , and the other slowly over a few hours will be released .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat the symptoms of seasonal rhin@@ itis ( h@@ ay pen@@ alties , through a allerg@@ y against pol@@ len path@@ way of nas@@ al paths ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ zzle ( clo@@ ths nose ) .
for adults and adolescents ages 12 , the recommended dose of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice daily a tablet that should be taken with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be so short as possible , as soon as the symptoms , especially the sw@@ elling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( stopped nose ) .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be found on the const@@ ip@@ ation of the nose .
the most effective measures were the changes in the sever@@ ity of the Heu@@ v@@ ee ymp@@ an@@ ome that were reported from the patient before the treatment and during 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , patients showed their symptoms every 12 hours in a di@@ ary and evaluated the symptoms related to the symptoms in the last 12 hours .
in consideration of all Heu@@ v@@ ectors of the nose reported patients , the aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze had reported about a decrease of symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % , compared to 3@@ 5.9 % with the patient , the p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine alone .
when only the sw@@ elling of nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was regarded , the patients showed up 3@@ 7.4 % compared with aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze compared to 26.@@ 7 % for the patient who Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine alone .
the most common side effects of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) , speed@@ y@@ car@@ ess ( appet@@ ite ) , oral mal@@ function , head@@ ache , fatigue , In@@ som@@ nie ( ins@@ om@@ nia ) , man@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( ins@@ om@@ nia ) , man@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( ins@@ om@@ nia ) , ins@@ om@@ nia and nerv@@ ousness .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be overweight ( allergic ) against Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine or one of the other components , against ad@@ ver@@ ge active substances or Lor@@ at@@ adin ( a different medicines for the treatment of allergi@@ es ) .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze cannot be used in patients with hyper@@ tension ( increased eye pressure ) , cardiovascular disease ( over@@ function of thy@@ roid ) , hyper@@ thy@@ re@@ osis ( over@@ function of the thy@@ roid ) , or have already caused an hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke ( caused by a brain injury ) or a risk for an hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission announced a approval for the market launch of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in the entire European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , however , is in the whole of the whole ( i.e. without it to cr@@ ashes , break or chew@@ ing ) .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used in children under 12 years due to the lack of data concerning the failure and effectiveness ( see section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application is so short as possible , and should not be continued after de@@ formation of symptoms .
it is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days , as long as long application the activity of p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine can take away .
after decline of sw@@ elling mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es in the upper re@@ spir@@ atory cause , treatment with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine can be continued as Mon@@ otherapy .
since Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze P@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine , the medicine is also con@@ tra@@ ded with patients who are treated with a mono@@ amin@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or and within 2 weeks after completion of such treatment .
this is due to the alph@@ an@@ im@@ etric activity with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ kers such as Bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pit@@ in , Per@@ go@@ id , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine or other dec@@ on@@ gest@@ iv@@ a , phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ pan@@ ze@@ k , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine , ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine , Ox@@ y@@ met@@ az@@ olin , Nap@@ h@@ olin , etc . ) .
the safety and effectiveness of these combination therapy were not tested and the data are not sufficient to express appropriate recommendations to the dosage .
the safety and efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver function wasn &apos;t checked and the data are not sufficient to express appropriate recommendations to the dosage .
patients must be informed that treatment for occurr@@ ence of hyper@@ tension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ esses , heart rhyth@@ mi@@ ds , nau@@ sea or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( like head@@ aches or an ampli@@ fication of head@@ aches ) must be depos@@ ited .
in the treatment of the following patient groups , patients with hyper@@ tension • patients with hyper@@ tension • patients with hyper@@ tension • patients with hyper@@ tension • patients with a m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction in an@@ am@@ ity , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder or bron@@ ch@@ ds in the An@@ am@@ ity .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is required at least 48 hours prior to the implementation of mat@@ ological tests , because anti@@ hist@@ amine otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions or in their magn@@ itude .
in the context of clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , at which Er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally given , however there were no clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions or changes in the plasma concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin .
no significant differences between the patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine and treated with placebo treated patients , regardless of whether Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine alone or with alcohol was taken .
it is not yet identified for metabol@@ ism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine enzymes that inter@@ actions with other medicines are not entirely excluded .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in@@ hib@@ its in @-@ vi@@ vo CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medicine CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 is not in@@ hib@@ ited and neither a sub@@ strate is a inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein .
the dis@@ solution of the use of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not secured , experiences of a large number of affected pregn@@ an@@ cies , however there is no increase in frequency of ab@@ normal@@ ities compared to the frequency of the normal population .
since re@@ productive studies on animals are not always transferred to humans and not used due to vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ ving properties of p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ in should not be applied in the pregnancy .
however , patients should be clari@@ fied that in very rare cases , in very rare cases , can lead to a impair@@ ment of transport or ability to serve machines .
symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( coding , Ap@@ no@@ e , reduced mental attention , cy@@ an@@ osis , Kom@@ a , heart @-@ cycle collapse ) and a Z@@ NS stimulation ( ins@@ om@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , Tre@@ mor , Kon@@ vul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ tering .

a Z@@ NS stimulation is especially likely to taste such as at@@ rop@@ ine @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth dry , po@@ up@@ ill@@ en@@ rigid and - di@@ lat@@ ation , hood , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal symptoms ) .
these include both the inhibit@@ ing of pro@@ inflamm@@ atory cy@@ to@@ kin@@ en such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 8 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 , as well as the inhibit@@ or of the expression of the adhesion of the Ad@@ ver@@ sion@@ er P @-@ sel@@ ess on end@@ oth@@ el@@ ial cells .
in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement sizes of the flight power , including the rein@@ forcement sub@@ jective and the tasks that are connected to the flies .
in controlled clinical studies , the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily has no increased frequency of dro@@ w@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo .
the orange application of P@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine in the recommended dosage can cause additional sympath@@ etic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ ing or manifest@@ ations of a Z@@ NS Er@@ reg@@ .
1,@@ 248 patients took part in the age between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allerg@@ y rhin@@ itis , 414 patients received Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets .
in both studies the hist@@ amine @-@ ant@@ agon@@ istic effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets , determined by the overall of the symptoms ( except for nas@@ al membran@@ es ) , significantly higher than in a mon@@ otherapy with p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine about the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets in terms of weak@@ ening effect , determined by the nas@@ al mu@@ zzle , was significantly higher than under a mono@@ therap@@ ist with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine about the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender , age or ethnic origin .
as part of a single dose study for pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ et@@ ics of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine is det@@ ec@@ table within 30 minutes after administration in plasma .

it is available as a 5 mg tablet , 5 m@@ g@@ - and 5 m@@ g. melting tablets ( tablets , which dissolve in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and as a 0.5 mg / ml solution .
for children between one and five years the dose is 1,@@ 25 mg once daily , in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup respectively .
for children ages 6 to 11 , the dose is 2.5 mg once daily , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup respectively .
A@@ eri@@ us was studied in a total of eight studies involving approximately 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhin@@ itis ( including four trials with seasonal rhin@@ itis and two trials in patients who also had as@@ thma ) .
the effectiveness was measured by changing the symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of squares , impair@@ ment of sleep and performance on the day ) before and after six weeks of treatment was determined .
further studies were presented to prove that the body increases the sy@@ rup , the solution to insert and melting hot tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children are un@@ think@@ able .
in allergic rhin@@ itis , if the results were taken together with 5 mg of A@@ eri@@ us to an average decrease of symptoms ( symptoms of symptoms ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients who received a placebo .
in the two studies of Ur@@ tik@@ aria , the decrease of symptoms after six weeks of symptoms were treated with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % compared to placebo @-@ treated patients with 40 and 33 % .
A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may be over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , Lor@@ at@@ adin or one of the other components .
in January 2001 , the European Commission published SP Europe approval for placing on the market of A@@ eri@@ us in the entire European Union .
one tablet once daily , with one or without a meal , to prevent symptoms of allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ) and Ur@@ ti@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there are limited experience of clinical studies for efficacy in the application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis ( occurr@@ ence of symptoms of less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks ) should be terminated according to the symptoms and can be resumed after de@@ formation of symptoms .
persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ( occurr@@ ence of symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) can be recommended for patients during the age of age .
clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions were not found in clinical studies with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin pills to which Er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally given ( see below Section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol was not strengthened the efficient effect of alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
however , patients should be clari@@ fied that it can occur in very rare cases that can lead to a impair@@ ment of transport or ability to serve machines .
clinical studies in various indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ tik@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more adverse events in patients suffering from patients who were treated with placebo .
the most common adverse events that were more common than placebo were fatigue ( 1,2 % ) , mouth dry ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ ache ( 0.6 % ) .
in a clinical study of 5@@ 78 adol@@ escent patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common adverse events were treated with 5.9 % of the patients who were treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine with 6.9 % of the patients who were treated with placebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study , with up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine ( Ne@@ un@@ fold clinical dose ) were observed , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
this includes both the in@@ hibition of pro@@ inflamm@@ atory cy@@ to@@ kin@@ en such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 8 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 as well as the inhibit@@ or of the expression of the adhesion of the adhesion of the Ad@@ rophy cells .
as part of a clinical study with multiple doses , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statistically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of clinical dose ) over ten days , showed no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c intervals .
in a single dos@@ is@@ ance study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement sizes of the flight power , including the ampli@@ fication of sub@@ jective and tasks that are connected to the flies .
in patients with allergic rhin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the linear@@ ity of symptoms such as Ni@@ ese , Nas@@ en@@ secre@@ tion and it@@ chy of nose , it@@ ching and wat@@ ering of eyes as well as Ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z on the roof of the pal@@ ate .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rhin@@ itis can be divided in dependence on the duration of symptoms alternatively in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as occurr@@ ence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
per@@ sist@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as occurr@@ ence of symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
as shown by the total of questionn@@ aire for the quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tiv@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively remov@@ es ast@@ eri@@ us effectively caused by seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis .
the chron@@ ically idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ tik@@ aria was investig@@ ating the underlying Path@@ ophysi@@ ology , since the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology is similar to different forms and chronic patients can be recru@@ ited .
as the hist@@ amine compensation factor of a factor in all ur@@ gical diseases is expected that Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin besides the chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ ti@@ aria is expected to improve the symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines .
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials about 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ tik@@ aria was effective in the improvement of p@@ inn@@ itus and the size of squares at the end of the first dose intervals .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines of chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ ti@@ ia , the minority of the patients who did not re@@ acted on anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines , from the study .
an improvement in the it@@ ching of more than 50 % was observed at 55 % of patients with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine treated patients compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the disorder of sleep and growth , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale on the evaluation of these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ et@@ etics study , in which the patients were comparable with the general seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis - population was comparable to 4 % of patients a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine .
there are no deposit points for clinical @-@ relevant cum@@ ulation after a daily application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( 5 @-@ 20 mg ) over 14 days .
however , that is not yet identified for metabol@@ ism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , however , inter@@ actions involving other medicines are not entirely excluded .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in@@ hib@@ its in @-@ vi@@ vo no CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medicine CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 is not in@@ hib@@ ited and neither a sub@@ strate is a inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein .
in a single dos@@ cope with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine , with a dosage of 7.5 mg , meals ( fet@@ a , low cal@@ orie breakfast ) is not available on the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin .
the clinical trials performed with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and Lor@@ at@@ adin demonstrated a comparable degree of the exposition of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , no qualitative or quantitative differences regarding the tox@@ ic@@ ad@@ ine of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and Lor@@ at@@ adin .

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals , to prevent symptoms of allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ) and Ur@@ ti@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the pres@@ cription physician should be aware of that most cases of rhin@@ itis in children under 2 years are caused by infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that no data are pre@@ ference , which support a treatment of inf@@ ectious rhin@@ itis with A@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to the exclusion of upper re@@ spir@@ atory infections or anatom@@ ical an@@ om@@ al@@ ies , the diagnosis , physical investigations and corresponding laboratory and skin investigations should play a role .
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years of metab@@ oli@@ zed Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin limited and experienced a higher sub@@ strate load ( see below Section 5.2 ) .
the security of A@@ eri@@ us si@@ up in children between 2 and 11 years , which is limited , is identical to children that metab@@ oli@@ zed normal .

A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used to protect against influenza , which is caused by the tribe of influenza , which is caused by the tribe ( type ) H5@@ N1 of influenza A @-@ virus .
this is a special type of vaccine that could cause before a trunk of influenza , which may cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
an influenza pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out if a new trunk of influenza could easily distribute human being , because humans have no immun@@ ity ( no protection ) .
after administration of the vaccine , the immune system det@@ ects the parts of the Gri@@ pp@@ ev@@ irus as &quot; body foreign &quot; and forms anti@@ bodies .
this is the immune system later in the position to form a contact with a flu virus of this stem .
afterwards , the membrane cover of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membran@@ es that det@@ ects the human body as a physical foreign body ) and used as part of the vaccine .
a inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not conducted in accordance with the &quot; Good Clinical Practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
as a result , the scope of clinical data base for the evaluation of the vaccine of vacc@@ ines did not comply with the requirements of the guidelines of the EMEA for preventive vacc@@ ines .
if you need to participate in a clinical study and require further information about your treatment , please contact your treatment doctor .
if you wish further information regarding the recommendations of CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years , which are caused by human immun@@ ode@@ ficiency Syndrome ( HIV @-@ 1 ) which caused the acquired immun@@ ode@@ ficiency Syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who cannot swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ gen@@ ase is available as a solution to insert , but these cannot be taken together with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , because the safety of this combination was not examined .
A@@ gen@@ ase should only be instit@@ uted when the physician has tested the an@@ tivir@@ al medicines of the patient previously taken , and the probability is judged that the virus may be entrusted to the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , with twice daily 100 mg of r@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines .
for children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ gen@@ ase is aimed at body weight .
A@@ gen@@ ase reduces HIV @-@ quantity in blood in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines in the blood and keeps them at a low level .
AIDS is not able to heal AIDS , however , it may have the pe@@ eling of the immune system and thus far from the development of AIDS @-@ related infections and diseases .
A@@ gen@@ ase has been studied in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines , however , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who did not have been treated with prot@@ otyp@@ ing .
this with low do@@ si@@ avi@@ r reinforced medicine A@@ gen@@ ase was compared with 206 adults who had previously taken earlier prot@@ ectors , with other proteins .
principal inde@@ b@@ ator for the efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ec@@ table concentrations of HIV in blood ( Vir@@ us@@ last ) or the change of vir@@ us@@ last after treatment .
in the studies with patients who had previously taken no prot@@ otyp@@ ed , however , after 48 weeks , more patients had a vir@@ us@@ load under 400 copies / ml than under placebo but A@@ gen@@ ase were less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ gen@@ ase has also reduced the vir@@ us@@ load , but with the children who had been treated earlier with prot@@ otyp@@ ed , only very few on the treatment .
in the study with adults who had been treated earlier with prot@@ otyp@@ ed numbers , sen@@ ed with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r enhanced medicines A@@ gen@@ ase ampli@@ fied vir@@ us@@ last after 16 weeks of treatment as effective as other proteins .
in patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other proteins , it came under A@@ gen@@ e@@ avi@@ r with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a stronger waste of vir@@ us@@ last after four weeks than in the patient who continued their previous release .
the most common adverse events of A@@ gen@@ ase ( ob@@ serves more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ ache , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ( di@@ arr@@ he@@ a ) , Nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , vom@@ iting , r@@ ash and Fati@@ gue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ gen@@ ase may not be used in patients who are possibly super@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r or one of the other components .
A@@ gen@@ ase may not be used in patients , the cur@@ rant herb ( a vegetable preparation for treating depression ) or pharmac@@ euticals , which are equally suited as A@@ gen@@ ase , and in high concentrations in the blood of health harmful .
as with other medicines for HIV , the A@@ gen@@ ase ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , an oste@@ opor@@ osis ( changes in bone tissue ) or an immun@@ ity activation ( symptoms of infection that caused by the rest@@ oring immune system ) .
at the end , the Committee of Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of A@@ gen@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines for treating HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected adults and children aged over four years compared to the risks .
A@@ gen@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ et@@ etic amplifier R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee presented that the benefits of A@@ gen@@ ase in combination with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who previously not have not been detected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gen@@ ase was originally approved in &quot; extraordinary circumstances , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the time of approval from scientific reasons only limited information template . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2000 , the European Commission issued a approval for the company Gla@@ xo Group Limited for placing on the market of A@@ gen@@ ase in the entire European Union .
gen@@ ase is in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines for treating HIV @-@ 1- infected , inhibit@@ or ( PI ) pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .
for usually , A@@ gen@@ ase capsules should be administered to pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ et@@ etic booster set by Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r along with low doses of r@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r should be carried out in consideration of the individual vir@@ al resistance pattern and treatment of patients ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ b@@ avi@@ r as a solution to take up 14 % less than a capsule ; therefore A@@ gen@@ ase capsules and solution can not be inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gen@@ ase capsules amounts to 600 mg of am@@ bo@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg r@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines .
2 If A@@ gen@@ ase capsules be applied without the ampli@@ fication of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Boo@@ ger ) , higher doses are applied to A@@ gen@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gen@@ ase capsules amounts to 20 mg Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etics , efficacy and safety of A@@ gen@@ ase in combination with low doses of r@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other proteins were not examined with children .
gen@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to the absence of data to un@@ think@@ able and effectiveness ( see section 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ et@@ etic data the dose to A@@ gen@@ ase capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function at 300 mg twice daily .
con@@ current use should be performed in patients with mild or regular liver function with cau@@ tion , in patients with severe liver function it is counter@@ inde@@ xed ( see section 4.3 ) .
the gen@@ ase can not be given simultaneously with drugs which have a low therapeutic width and also sub@@ str@@ ates the sub@@ str@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ oner ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ ation ) included , may not be applied due to the risk reduction in plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of am@@ b@@ avi@@ r during taking am@@ b@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be pointed out that A@@ gen@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy do not lead to cure the HIV infection and that they may also develop opportun@@ istic infections or other comp@@ lications of a HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy including the treatment with A@@ gen@@ ase prevents the risk of transfer from HIV to other sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for usually A@@ gen@@ ase capsules are to be applied along with low doses of r@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients receiving chronic hepatitis B or C suffer from chronic hepatitis B and with an anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy , have increased risk of heavy liver preparations with potentially fatal course .
for the fall of simultaneous an@@ tivir@@ al treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant information about this medic@@ inal products .
patients with existing reduced liver function including a chronic active hepatitis indicate an increased frequency of liver function under an anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous application of A@@ gen@@ ase and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r with fluor@@ ti@@ c@@ ason or other Glu@@ k@@ ok@@ or@@ tic is not recommended unless the possible use of system@@ ic kor@@ ost@@ ero@@ i@@ der effects including Mor@@ bus C@@ ushing and Supp@@ ression of the secondary function ( see section 4.5 ) .
since the inc@@ iner@@ ation of the H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , a simultaneous administration of my@@ opath@@ ies , including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ ol@@ y@@ sen , is not recommended .
4 For some medicines that may cause serious or physical effects , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and War@@ far@@ in ( under monitoring the International standardi@@ zation ratio ) , methods for determination of the concentration concentration .
in patients who take the medicine at the same time , A@@ gen@@ ase can be effective because of reduced plasma cutting of am@@ b@@ avi@@ r less effective ( see section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of metab@@ olic inter@@ actions with Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contra@@ tiv@@ a can be altered , but the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of inter@@ actions .
if meth@@ ad@@ on is given to am@@ bo@@ b@@ r at the same time , the patient should therefore be monitored on op@@ oli@@ ent@@ osis sympt@@ om , in particular if they are still very low doses of r@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
due to the possible risk of tox@@ icity of a tox@@ icity in the A@@ gen@@ ase solution , this formulation is tra@@ ded with children under an age of four years and should be used with cau@@ tion during certain other patient groups .
gen@@ ase should be placed on duration 5 if a r@@ ash of system@@ ic or allergic symptoms are accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
in patients who received an anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy including protein inhibit@@ or , was reported about the occurr@@ ence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , Hyper@@ gl@@ yk@@ emia or an ex@@ ac@@ al type of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus .
many of the patients had other diseases to which other therapy were necessary to be associated with the development of a diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , or hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia .
B. higher age , and with pharmaceutical @-@ dependent factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al treatment and associated metab@@ olic disorders , associated .
in hem@@ oph@@ ile patients ( type A and B ) , which were treated with prot@@ otyp@@ ed numbers , reports about an increase of ble@@ eding including spontaneous hem@@ at@@ oms and hem@@ mar@@ thro@@ es .
in HIV @-@ infected people with heavy immune effect can develop a inflamm@@ atory reaction to as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ du@@ ical opportun@@ istic infections , which leads to severe clinical trials or deteri@@ oration of symptoms .
although a multi@@ fac@@ tor@@ ial etching , alcohol consumption , severe immune diseases , higher Body @-@ Mass Index , were reported cases of oste@@ opor@@ osis in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term application of anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy ( ART ) .
CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width of A@@ gen@@ ase may not have to have a low therapeutic width and also sub@@ str@@ ates the sub@@ str@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ oner ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width of A@@ gen@@ e@@ avi@@ r must not be used together with pharmac@@ euticals , whose substances are mainly exchanged via CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and are connected to increased plasma cutting with serious and / or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C by Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r caused that lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and lead to resistance development .
attemp@@ ting to treat the plasma cutting by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , were very often un@@ wanted effects on the liver .
cur@@ i@@ ins ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ ated ) The ser@@ um mirror of am@@ bo@@ avi@@ r can be decreased by the simultaneous application of plant preparations with cur@@ rant herb ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ ated ) .
if a patient takes off cur@@ ri@@ can@@ yon , the am@@ algam asc@@ ents and , if possible , check the vir@@ us@@ last and check the cur@@ rant herb .
a dose custom@@ ization for one of the medicine is not necessary if Nel@@ ly avi@@ r is administered along with Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ lit ear@@ ing below ) .
508 % increased , if R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) is administered in combination with am@@ bo@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical trials , doses of 600 mg Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r applied twice daily and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , to prove the effectiveness and un@@ think@@ able of this treatment schem@@ at@@ as .
52 % lower , when Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) in combination with cal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg L@@ oc@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg r@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) was administered .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r on plasma , which have been achieved during the combination of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with cal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg per day ) with cal@@ et@@ ra ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg r@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
a dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , it is recommended that the effectiveness and un@@ think@@ est of this combination is not known .
there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ et@@ ical study in combination with di@@ aph@@ os@@ in combination , but is recommended because of the ant@@ a@@ bic@@ ide component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , however , is recommended for at least one hour ( see Ant@@ azi@@ da below ) .
therefore , in combination with am@@ bo@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dose custom@@ ization needed .
treatment with egg ir@@ on@@ ably in combination with am@@ b@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended because the exposure of both prot@@ ectors are low .
the effects of Ne@@ vi@@ rapidly decre@@ ed to other proteins and existing data that Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ ine could reduce the ser@@ um concentration of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r .
if this medication should be used simultaneously , there is be careful because Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din is less effective because of the reduction and possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma cutting might be effective .
when these medicines will be applied together , cau@@ tion is required ; a thor@@ ough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical surveillance should be done , as an accurate forecast of combination of am@@ b@@ avi@@ r and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r to Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din is difficult .
the simultaneous gift of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ ol@@ ut@@ in led to an increase of plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) of Ri@@ og@@ ut@@ in at 193 % , and therefore associated with Ri@@ og@@ ut@@ in associated side effects .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons , Ri@@ og@@ ut@@ in together with A@@ gen@@ ase is to be administered in at least half of the recommended dose , although no clinical data is pre@@ defined .
pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ et@@ ical studies with A@@ gen@@ ase in combination with Er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in were not performed , but the plasma cutting of both medicines could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration .
the simultaneous application of two times a day , 700 mg F@@ os@@ amp@@ oule r and 100 mg of r@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once a day lead to 2,@@ 69@@ times per day compared to the value that was observed after 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once a day without simultaneous use of f@@ os@@ he@@ avi@@ r with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines that are listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , inhibit@@ or or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can be used together with A@@ gen@@ ase , possibly to inter@@ actions .
patients should therefore be linked to toxic reactions to be monitored by these medicines , if they are applied in combination with A@@ gen@@ ase .
based on the data of other prot@@ ectors , it is advis@@ able that ant@@ acids should not be taken at the same time as A@@ gen@@ ase , since it can come to res@@ or@@ ption disorders .
the simultaneous application of Anti@@ con@@ vul@@ si@@ va , known as an enzyme induc@@ tors ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , lead to am@@ bo@@ avi@@ r by am@@ bo@@ avi@@ r .
the ser@@ um concentrations of calcium can@@ al@@ ers like Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , sl@@ ander@@ pin , Nic@@ ola pin , Ni@@ odi@@ pin , Ni@@ odi@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased 10 by Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r , thereby reducing the activity and tox@@ icity of this medicine .
simultaneous intake of A@@ gen@@ ase can increase their plasma concentrations in conjunction with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors or associated side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ review , tend@@ encies and prim@@ ap@@ hor@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study , in R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µg of flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) were significantly reduced during the end@@ ogen@@ ous K@@ ort@@ is@@ ol rose by approximately 86 % ( 90 % -@@ interval between 82 and 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous gift of A@@ gen@@ e@@ avi@@ r are not recommended together with these glucose levels , unless the possible use of a treatment is the risk of system@@ ic kor@@ ost@@ ero@@ i@@ der effects ( see section 4.4 ) .
in case of H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase , such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , which is dependent on the ins@@ ulating plasma cutting of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are expected to be expected at the same time administration of A@@ gen@@ ase .
since plasma level increases the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or in my@@ opath@@ y , including a R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ ol@@ y@@ sis , the combined application of this medicine is not recommended .
it is a common monitoring of therapeutic concentrations up to stabil@@ ization of the mirror , as the plasma concentrations of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , rap@@ am@@ yc@@ in and t@@ acro@@ lim@@ us can be increased from Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) .
therefore , A@@ gen@@ ase may not be used together with oral gen@@ om@@ men@@ em Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) , while for the same use of A@@ gen@@ ase with par@@ ab@@ olic Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am is careful .
data for the simultaneous application of par@@ ab@@ olic Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other protein inhibit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in plasma cutting of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am around the 3 @-@ 4 @-@ watch .
if meth@@ ad@@ on is administered along with Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r , the patient should therefore be monitored on op@@ o@@ z. symptoms , in particular if they are still very low doses of r@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
due to the low distortion of the same time , no recommendation can be given as the am@@ algam dose is given when Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r is given at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ on .
in addition to the gift of War@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , an increased control of IN@@ R ( International standardi@@ zation ratio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or rein@@ forcement of anti@@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of r@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contra@@ tiv@@ a is not predic@@ table , therefore also recommended methods for the conception .
a careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ til@@ in ) is recommended for the same gift from A@@ gen@@ ase ( see section 4.4 ) .
this medicine may only be applied during pregnancy after more careful handling of the potential use for the mother in comparison to the potential risks for the fet@@ us .
in the milk l@@ yp@@ ass rats were detected , Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances is not known , but it is not known whether Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r goes over to breast milk .
a reproduction study on tr@@ inal rats , which was administered by ni@@ hil@@ ation in the uter@@ us until the end of the n@@ urs@@ ing of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r , showed a reduced increase of 12 body weight in the income .
further development of income including fertil@@ ity and re@@ productive capacity was not imp@@ aired by the administration of am@@ b@@ avi@@ r to the parent .
the in@@ solvency of A@@ gen@@ ase has been studied in adults and children 4 years and in combination with different other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines .
most related side effects associated with the A@@ gen@@ ase treatment were slightly up to moderate , coming up early on and led rare to the treatment of treatment .
during many of these events , it is not clari@@ fied whether they are in connection with the consumption of A@@ gen@@ ase or another at the same time to HIV @-@ treatment , or whether they are a consequence of gr@@ ass@@ disease .
most of the mentioned effects are from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 3@@ 001 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which with prot@@ otyp@@ ing not previously treated patients 1200 mg of A@@ gen@@ ase twice daily .
events ( degrees 2 to 4 ) , which were evaluated by the testing facility in connection with the study period and were performed in more than 1 % of the patients as well as under the treatment of laboratory changes ( degrees 3 to 4 ) .
the anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy was associated with HIV @-@ patients ( Li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ rophy ) with HIV @-@ patients , including a loss of peri@@ pher@@ ical and corne@@ al fat tissue , hyper@@ t@@ rophy of the breasts and dor@@ so@@ vi@@ al fat collection ( Sti@@ ff neck ) .
under 113 anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al not pre@@ treated persons who had been treated with am@@ iv@@ avi@@ r in combination with Lam@@ iv@@ ud@@ ine / Z@@ id@@ ov@@ ud@@ in over a middle duration of 36 weeks , was observed only one case ( Sti@@ ff neck ) ( &lt; 1 % ) .
in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 , with 245 N@@ R@@ TI@@ - pre @-@ treated patients under Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 11 % ) in comparison with different N@@ R@@ TI@@ s in combination with various N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a median duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) .
skin supplements were usually light up to moder@@ ately pronoun@@ ced , ery@@ them@@ atic or mac@@ ular nature , with or without it@@ ching and disappeared spont@@ ane@@ ously within two weeks without the treatment with Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r had to be canc@@ eled .
cases of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ a were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term application of anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy ( ART ) .
in HIV @-@ infected people with a serious immune effect , the introduction of a anti @-@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy ( ART ) can develop anti @-@ inflamm@@ atory reaction to as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ du@@ ical opportun@@ istic infections ( see section 4.4 ) .
with PI pre @-@ treated patients , the 600 mg of A@@ gen@@ ase were observed twice daily along with low do@@ si@@ bl@@ avi@@ r ( degrees 2 to 4 ) and laboratory of adverse events ( degrees 2 to 4 ) and laboratory of adverse events ( degrees 2 to 4 ) were observed in patients who received A@@ gen@@ ase , along with low do@@ si@@ bl@@ avi@@ r , very frequently occurred .
in case of evidence , the patient is observed on signs of an in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) , if necessary , necessary support measures are necessary .

an@@ tivir@@ al activity of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was examined in both acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ ast@@ ical cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , C@@ em @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) by Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r lies in the range from 0,0@@ 12 to 0,@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M with chronic infected cells
the connection between the activity of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the inhibit@@ ing of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al not pre @-@ treated patients with the currently approved F@@ os@@ amp@@ q@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r doses have been observed , as described in other R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r treatment schem@@ atic - the mut@@ ations described only rarely observed .

in the study AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) with prot@@ otyp@@ ing treated patients present in patients with vi@@ ro@@ log@@ istic failure over 96 weeks , the following proteins are :
gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis based analyses Gen@@ otyp@@ ical interpre@@ tations can be used for estim@@ ation of activity of am@@ b@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with protein resistant isol@@ ates .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for f@@ os@@ amp@@ b@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance than the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 147@@ A / M / M / S / M / S / M , I@@ 84@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M , with r@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r as well as a reduced probability of vi@@ ro@@ logical response ( resistance ) .
the conclusions regarding the relev@@ ance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation@@ sm@@ uster may be subject to additional data , and it is recommended to tigh@@ ten the current interpre@@ tations for analysis of resistance tests .
phen@@ otyp@@ ical analyses clin@@ ically vali@@ dated phen@@ otyp@@ ical interpretation systems can be used in combination with the gen@@ otyp@@ ical data relating to the activity of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with protein resistant isol@@ ates .
companies that distribute diagnostic resistance tests , clin@@ ically developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ offs ( partition points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be used for interpretation of a resistance tests .
each of these four with a reduced sensitivity against Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r associated genetic patterns creates a certain cross @-@ resistance against R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , which remains sensitivity against in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ ly avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r in general .
there are currently data available for cross @-@ resistance between Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ otyp@@ ing for all 4 F@@ os@@ amp@@ ons resist@@ or resistance , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al not previously treated patients , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 Isol@@ ate ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , b@@ ill@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Tip@@ ran@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 isol@@ ates ) .
inver@@ ted Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r reserves its activity against some other protein @-@ resistant isol@@ ate when receiving this activity seems to be dependent on the number and of the type of resistance mut@@ ations in isol@@ ates .
the early sl@@ ump of a failed therapy is recommended to hold the he@@ ave of a variety of mut@@ ations in borders , which can be extended to the subsequent treatment .
the cover of the efficacy of A@@ gen@@ ase in combination with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized study ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , mainly with lowest r@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , &quot; received .
one hundred and thre@@ es@@ core ( n = 163 ) patients with subsequent virus sensitivity to A@@ gen@@ ase , at least one other PI and at least one N@@ RT@@ I were included in the sub@@ study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
primary analysis presented the non @-@ sub @-@ su@@ peri@@ ority of AP@@ V / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the time @-@ adjusted average change of output ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ sub @-@ wave threshold of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the cover of un@@ born A@@ gen@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials with 288 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 were treated with PI .
in the studies , A@@ gen@@ ase Solution has been taken three times daily , 20 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , with the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily .
there was no low @-@ do@@ si@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of PI previously treated patients had at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s .
after 48 weeks , about 25 % of the patients enrolled a plasma HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml with a median increase in CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 19 Based on these data should be considered to be expected with PI pre @-@ treated children of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ found &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gen@@ ase &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; benefits expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to oral administration , the average duration ( T@@ max ) to the maximum ser@@ um concentration of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r is about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
508 % increased , for C@@ max , reduced by 30 % , when R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , together with Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease of AU@@ C but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ b@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
hence the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady @-@ State ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ affected by the food intake , although the simultaneous food intake increases the magn@@ itude and rate of res@@ or@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be seen on a large distribution volume and an unexpected penetration of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r from the t@@ issues in the tissue .

limited data de@@ pri@@ zed to a higher rate of thread reductions in HIV @-@ positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream has shown a lower effectiveness in this patient group .
treatment of bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the eyel@@ ids , the nose , the lips or the shar@@ ks was not examined .
local skin reactions are frequent , but the intensity of these reactions decreases in general during therapy or reactions , depending on the treatment of the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream .
if it is necessary due to the complaints of the patient or the sever@@ ity of local skin reactions , a treatment break may be made of several days .
the clinical outcome of therapy can be assessed according to re@@ generating the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
there are currently no data on long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months after the treatment , the super@@ structure of bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma should be drawn into consideration .
in patients with recur@@ rent and pre@@ treated B@@ CC@@ s there are no clinical experiences yet , therefore the application is not recommended in pre @-@ treated tum@@ ors .
data from an open clinical study indicate that at large tum@@ ours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 cm2 ) a lower probability of response to the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy exists .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not examined for treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ os on eyel@@ ids , inside the nose or ears or in the lift area within the Li@@ ppen@@ ots .
there are only very limited data about the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ os in anatom@@ ical places outside the face and scal@@ p .
the available data about the ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ osis to the lower arms and hands do not support the effectiveness of this application , therefore such an application is not recommended .
local skin reactions frequently occur , but these reactions are normally taken in the course of therapy to intensity or go after passing the therapy with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the local skin reactions to the patient are a great dis@@ comfort or very strong , the treatment can be suspended for a few days . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the data of an open clinical study showed that patients with more than 8 actors have a lower total re@@ medy rate than patients with less than 8 les@@ ions .
due to the immune stim@@ ulating properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od should be used with cau@@ tion to patients who received an immune treatment ( see 4.4 ) .
animal studies have no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / f@@ öt@@ al development , de@@ formation or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) .
although no recommendation is reached after one @-@ time top@@ ical application of qu@@ anti@@ fiable ser@@ um levels ( &gt; 5@@ n@@ g / ml ) , no recommendation can be given for use during the lac@@ tation period .
most of the most frequently asked , probably or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream in connection of side effects in studies with three weeks of treatment were local reactions on the site of the treatment ( 3@@ 3.7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated patients ) .
most of the most commonly reported , probably or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream in connection of side effects include complaints at the application area with a frequency of 28,@@ 1 % .
the patients treated by 185 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream @-@ treated Bas@@ ali@@ om patients from a placebo @-@ controlled clinical study of the Phase III side effects are listed below .
the most common , probably or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream in connection to these studies were an reaction on applic@@ ations@@ ort ( 22 % of the patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated patients ) .
adverse events that were evaluated by 252 in placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream treated patients with ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ osis are listed below .
this according to the evaluation plan of clinical trials with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream often indicates local skin reactions including Er@@ y@@ them ( 61 % ) , ero@@ sion / Ab@@ y@@ ss ( 23 % ) , Ex@@ c@@ ori@@ ation / Ab@@ y@@ ss ( 23 % ) and Ö@@ 1 ( 14 % ) ( see section 4.4 ) .
this according to audit plan shows that in these studies with 5 times a weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream very common to severe refresh@@ ments ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and severe sh@@ ampoo and seafood ( 19 % ) arrived .
in clinical studies for the investigation of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ osis , Alo@@ pe@@ e was diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment centre or in the ambient area .
the se@@ eable unique intake of 200 mg of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the content of about 16 bags , could cause nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , head@@ ache , my@@ op@@ es and fever .
the clin@@ ically severe adverse events that occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , consisted in hyp@@ ot@@ onia , which normal@@ ized themselves after oral or intraven@@ ous liquid .
after the top@@ ical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , the system@@ ic concentrations of the alpha inter@@ fer@@ ment and other cy@@ to@@ k@@ ine were detected after the top@@ ical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od .
in 3 piv@@ ot@@ al Phase 3 efficacy studies could be shown that the efficacy in relation to a complete healing of the fen@@ ders at a I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment over 16 weeks of a placebo treatment is clearly superior .
at 60 % of the patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od in patients , the fet@@ ters were completely healed ; this was 20 % of 105 patients with placebo in case ( 95 % CI ) .
a full healing could be achieved at 23 % of 157 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated male patients compared to 5 % of 161 patients treated with placebo ( 95 % CI ) :
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was investigated in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .
the target parts were hist@@ ologically confirmed single primary super@@ structure cell car@@ cin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 cm2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
the data from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study on four years of this data show that approximately 7@@ 9.3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.7 % , 8@@ 4.9 % ) of all treated patients were clin@@ ically isolated and remained for 48 months .
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od is three times a weekly application in one or two periods of treatment of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies .
the patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non @-@ hyper@@ ker@@ at@@ otic , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ ic - les@@ ions within a program of 25 cm2 on the un@@ hair@@ y scal@@ p or in the face .
initial observation period of two combined observation studies show a recur@@ ren@@ di@@ ment rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical trials after one or two treatment spaces .
the approved indications of the indications , ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ osis and super@@ fi@@ zi@@ elles bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma occurs in pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients generally not tested and were not examined .
Al@@ dar@@ a cream was investigated in four randomised , double @-@ blind placebo controlled trials of children aged 2 to 15 years with M@@ oll@@ us@@ c@@ um Cont@@ agi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 576 , placebo n = 313 ) .
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies by the dos@@ ages ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks ) .
a minimum system@@ ic intake of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream caused by the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ osis was observed during the three weekly application during 16 weeks .
the highest pharmaceutical concentrations in ser@@ um at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours , and lived 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 n@@ g / ml during application in face ( 12.5 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the calculated half @-@ time period was approximately 10 times higher than the 2@@ hour half @-@ time period after sub@@ cut@@ aneous application in a former study ; that indicates an extended retention of the medicine in the skin .
the data on system@@ ic exposition showed that the res@@ or@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od on the MC @-@ 12 years was low and comparable was comparable with healthy adults and adults with acute ker@@ at@@ osis or super@@ fi@@ zi@@ al bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month trial for the derm@@ is resulted in doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG , significantly reduced weight and increased mil@@ z weight ; also for four months , the study showed no similar effects in the mouse .
a two @-@ year study for car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ icity in mice on three days a week did not produce tum@@ ours at the application site .
the corresponding mechanism is not known but as I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od is only a small system@@ ic absorption of human skin and not dirty is a risk of people because of the systematic exposure than very low .
the tum@@ ours were treated in the group of mice , which was treated with the real @-@ free cream in earlier and in larger number as in the control group with low U@@ VR .
it can harm other people , even if these same symptoms have been substanti@@ ated as you . − When one of the adverse events you have significantly imp@@ airs side effects , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ists .

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is applied to treat patients with secured diagnosis of a Mu@@ b@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ des I ( MP@@ S I ; α -@@ l @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase defic@@ iency ) to handle the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( symptoms that are not related to brain or ner@@ ves ) .
this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cer@@ amin@@ og@@ ly@@ kan@@ e , g@@ ags ) are not dismant@@ led and thus un@@ spo@@ iled in most organs in the body .
the following non @-@ neuro@@ logical symptoms of the MP@@ S I can occur : enlarged liver , sti@@ ff joints , stim@@ ulating movements , reduces lung volume , heart and eye diseases .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be monitored by a physician , experience in the treatment of patients with MP@@ S I or other inher@@ ited metab@@ olic diseases .
the administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out in a hospital or clinic with re@@ mot@@ ions , and those patients require appropriate medicines to prevent allergic reaction .

in the study , the safety of the drug was investigated , however , was also measured by its effectiveness ( by decre@@ asing the reduction of G@@ AG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver was examined ) .
with children under five years of sen@@ mi@@ az@@ y@@ me the G@@ AG concentrations in the urine by approximately 60 % , and half of the treated children showed a normal big liver at the end of the study .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed with more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ ache , nau@@ sea , ab@@ dom@@ inal pain , skin r@@ ash , ar@@ rays , pain in the li@@ mb@@ s ( in hands and feet ) , heat compassion , fever and reactions to the infusion centre .
very common adverse events in patients under five years are increased blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measurement size of lung function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ ing ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and sh@@ ook .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not react to patients who are possibly sensitive to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or one of the other components ( an@@ aph@@ yl@@ actic response ) .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will be able to check all new information that may be known , testing and updating this summary .
the manufacturers of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will receive patients suffering from Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , with respect to the reactions to the fusion and the development of anti@@ bodies .
June 2003 , the European Commission announced the company G@@ enzyme Europe B.V. for placing on the placing of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in the entire European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a combin@@ ant form of human@@ oid α -@@ l @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology under the use of Ch@@ o @-@ Mamm@@ alog@@ y @-@ cell cultures ( Chinese Ham@@ ster O@@ ops , E@@ ier@@ stock of the Chinese Ham@@ sters ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is inde@@ xed to long @-@ time enzymes in patients with secured diagnosis of a Mu@@ b@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ des I ( MP@@ S I , α -@@ l @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase defic@@ iency ) to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out by a physician , experience in the treatment of patients with MP@@ S I or other her@@ edit@@ ary metab@@ olic diseases .
the initial in@@ infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient can be increased to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h every 15 minutes .
the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years was not determined , and for these patients , no dosing scheme can be recommended .
safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver in@@ suff@@ iciency was not determined , and for these patients , no dosing scheme can be recommended .
patients with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me treated patients may develop in@@ infusion @-@ related reactions , which are defined as any adverse events which occurs during the infusion or until the end of the infusion day ( see section 4.8 ) .
for this reason , these patients were able to continue to be monitored , and the infusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out only in an appropriate clinical environment , in the revival equipment for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies immediately .
due to the clinical phase 3 study , almost all patients Ig@@ G anti@@ bodies are involved against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months of treatment .
patients who develop anti@@ bodies or symptoms of in@@ infusion @-@ related reaction must be treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with cau@@ tion ( see sections 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
as little experience regarding the recovery of the treatment after a longer inter@@ ruption , must be careful because of the theoretical increased risk @-@ reaction after a inter@@ ruption of treatment .
60 minutes before the start of infusion with medic@@ ations ( anti@@ hist@@ amine and / or anti@@ py@@ r@@ ka ) to minim@@ ize the potential occurr@@ ence related reactions .
in case of light or intermediate @-@ related reaction , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and Par@@ ac@@ et@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen response should be performed and / or a reduction of infusion rate on half of the infusion rate in which the reaction has occurred .
in case of a single , severe in@@ infusion reaction , the infusion must be stopped , until the symptoms were brought to decline , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and Par@@ ac@@ et@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is necessary .
the infusion can be taken with a reduction of the infusion rate on 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate when the reaction has occurred .
3 ( Anti@@ hist@@ amine and Par@@ ac@@ et@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) as well as a reduction of the infusion rate on 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the previous reaction has occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Proc@@ ain , because there is a potential risk of interference with the intra@@ cell intake of Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
animal experimental studies can not be found on direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
no data on new@@ bor@@ ns that were exposed to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase over the breast milk , is recommended , is not recommended during treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
in clinical trials , mainly as in@@ infusion @-@ related reactions were reported that 53 % of patients in the Phase 3 study ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients were observed in the study with participants under 5 years ( duration of treatment up to 1 year ) .
undes@@ irable drug inter@@ actions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , who were observed during Phase 3 years or older at a total treatment duration of up to 4 years , are often observed in the following table : very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe MP@@ S @-@ I @-@ related participation of the upper re@@ spir@@ atory work and l@@ ungs in the pre@@ history came out heavy reactions to , including bronze soldier , breathing and visual acuity ( see section 4.4 ) .
children un@@ wanted drug inter@@ actions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , who were reported in a phase of 20 patients with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5 , with predominantly he@@ avier and a treatment duration of up to 12 months , are listed in the table .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
most of the patients came to a ser@@ y version within 3 months after the treatment of a ser@@ y @-@ version , with a he@@ avi@@ est frequency in the age of 5 years ( on average after 45 days versus 45 days in patients at the age of 5 years and older ) .
until the end of the Phase 3 study ( or up to a premature departure from the study ) were found at 13 / 45 patients with radio@@ immun@@ op@@ oi@@ esis ( R@@ IP ) Ass@@ ay , among them 3 patients who never had ever had come to Ser@@ pent version .
patients with a lack of low anti@@ bodies levels , a robust decre@@ asing of the G@@ AG mirror in Har@@ n , while patients with high antibody tit@@ res was to determine a variable reduction of G@@ AG in Har@@ n .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a mar@@ g@@ inal g@@ inal effect on the enz@@ ym@@ atic Lar@@ on@@ id@@ as@@ e- activity in vitro that seemed to affect clinical efficacy and / or reduction by G@@ AG in Har@@ n .
the presence of anti@@ bodies seemed not to stand in connection with the incidence of undes@@ ired drug inter@@ actions , although the occurr@@ ence of un@@ wanted drug inter@@ actions typically fell along with the formation of Ig@@ G anti@@ bodies .
the cause for the enzyme therapy is in one of the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of accumulated sub@@ str@@ ates and the preventing a further accum@@ ulation to restoration of enzymes .
following an intraven@@ ous infusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is quickly removed from circulation and cells into ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely about Mann@@ ose @-@ 6 @-@ phosphate recept@@ ors .
safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in a randomised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study at 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years .
although patients were recru@@ ited for the study that had been recru@@ ited to the total health spectrum , the majority of patients from the mean phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the heavy phen@@ otype .
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a for@@ c@@ ized exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected amount , and they had to be able to stand for 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the effectiveness were the percentage of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute walk in the 6 @-@ minute walk @-@ test .
all patients were then recru@@ ited for an Open @-@ label extension study where they received another 3.5 years long ( 182 weeks ) every week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
after 26 weeks of therapy , patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me treated patients compared to the placebo group an improvement of lung function and the ability to be shown in the following table .
in an open extension study , an improvement and / or maintaining this effects of up to 208 weeks in der@@ al@@ der@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and 182 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as shown out of the following table .
the decrease of the expected percentage point in FE@@ V is not significantly significantly , and the absolute pul@@ mon@@ ary volumes increased further proportional to the height of growing children .
of the 26 patients with an hepat@@ eg@@ alie treatment reached 22 ( 85 % ) up to the end of the study a normal liver size .
within the first 4 weeks , a clear waste of the G@@ AG mirror was found in Har@@ n ( µg / mg of cre@@ at@@ ine ) which remained constant until the end of the study .
regarding the hetero@@ gen@@ eous disease manifest@@ ation between the patients who has been taken into account , clin@@ ically significant changes in the 6 @-@ minute walk @-@ test , motion range of shoulder strap ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and deteri@@ oration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
one year @-@ old open phase 2 study was conducted in which mainly the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me was investigated in 20 patients who were under 5 years of age ( 16 patients with severe dec@@ ay form and 4 with the mean shift form ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased due to increased G@@ AG@@ - mirror at Har@@ n in week 22 in the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg .
in several patients , a magn@@ itude of magn@@ itude ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) was determined according to the Z Score for these age group ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and every 4 patients with severe dec@@ ay form only limited or even no progress in cogn@@ itive development .
in a phase 4 study , investigations into the co@@ ag@@ ical Impact of various Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me doses were carried out on G@@ AG mirror in Har@@ n , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dos@@ sier with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can represent with patients who have difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions , but is not detected that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two dosing schem@@ ata is equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will evaluate any new information that will be available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the medicine &apos;s characteristics will be updated .
pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ et@@ ical profile in patients at age 5 was similar to older and less affected patients .
based on conventional clinical studies for safety @-@ har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity in a mal@@ icious gift , tox@@ icity with re@@ productive medicine and re@@ productive tox@@ icity , the pre@@ clinical data can recognize no special haz@@ ards for human beings .

A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with cis@@ plat@@ in ( a other medicines that can not be removed ) and mal@@ ign@@ ant &quot; ( due to an operation alone ) and mal@@ ign@@ ant &quot; ( due to one operation only ) can be found on other parts of the body . • advanced or metastatic &quot; non @-@ small &quot; lung cancer , which attacks not the plate epi@@ thel@@ ial cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used in patients who were previously untreated , in combination with cis@@ plat@@ in and in patients who previously used other chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ies , used as sole therapy .
to reduce side effects , patients during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta should get a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as foli@@ c acid ( a vitamin ) and get inj@@ ections of vitamin B12 .
if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered along with cis@@ plat@@ in , should be given an &quot; Anti@@ em@@ et@@ il &quot; ( medicine against vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent fluid flow ) .
in patients whose blood is changed , or in which certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be removed or reduced the dose .
the active form of p@@ em@@ et@@ ically s@@ lows the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells that the cells split .
the conversion of P@@ em@@ et@@ re in its active form is easier in cancer cells lighter than in healthy cells , which leads to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer active period in cancer cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta was investigated for the treatment of mal@@ ign@@ ant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ atom in a main study of 456 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta were compared to 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease which previously had been treated with chemotherapy with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another drug against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( a further medicine against cancer ) , while both in combination with cis@@ plat@@ in in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients who were treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and cis@@ plat@@ in were over 12,@@ 1 months , compared to 9.3 months in the sole administration of Cis@@ plat@@ in .
in patients who previously received chemotherapy was the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta 8.3 months , compared with 7.9 months at doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
however , in both studies , patients showed that cancer cells were not used to prevent epi@@ thel@@ ial cells , during the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta longer survival times than with the comparative medicine .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued Eli Lil@@ ly Neder@@ land B.V. will permit a approval for the placing on the market of A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union .
each flow bottle has to be handled with 4.2 ml 0.9 % sodium chloride injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary do@@ dge ti@@ c@@ ism is taken to 100 ml of sodium chloride injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.6 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is indicated in combination with cis@@ plat@@ in is indicated for the first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic col@@ chi@@ al@@ car@@ cin@@ oma except for predomin@@ ating epi@@ thel@@ ial hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .

the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface area ( CO@@ F ) administered as an intraven@@ ous infusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day every 21 day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of cis@@ plat@@ in is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as infusion over a period of 2 hours approx . 30 minutes after completion of the package In@@ fusion on the first day every 21 day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al@@ car@@ cin@@ oma following previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered as an intraven@@ ous infusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
a reduction of incidence and sever@@ ity of skin reactions must be given a day before and on the day of the p@@ em@@ et@@ ous gift and the day after treatment a cor@@ ost@@ ero@@ id .
during seven days before the first dose of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ bo@@ xed must be taken at least 5 doses of foli@@ c acid and intake needs to be continued during the whole treatment duration and for another 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ate dose .
patients also need to receive a in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection of vitamin B12 ( 1000 mc@@ g ) in the week before the first P@@ em@@ et@@ re @-@ dose as well as after each third parties .
in patients who received P@@ em@@ et@@ re , should be created before each gift a complete ble@@ al image , including a differentiation of the leu@@ k@@ oc@@ ytes and a t@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ g@@ um@@ eration .
the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ at @-@ Trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ anine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose review will take place under the Al@@ adi@@ rs of the blood picture or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity of the previous therapy cycles .
after recovery the patients must be treated according to the notes in the tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are used for AL@@ IM@@ TA as a mono@@ therap@@ ist or in combination with cis@@ plat@@ in .
these criteria comply with the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ icity Crit@@ eria ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degree 2 blood .
patients do not develop hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ≥ degrees 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity ) , the therapy must be interrupted by AL@@ IM@@ TA until the patient needs the value before the treatment .
the treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be canc@@ eled if in patients after 2 dose reduc@@ ers a hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ oner on the occurr@@ ence of degrees 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
clinical studies showed no evidence that in patients at age 65 , or in comparison to patients at age 65 , an elevated side effects of an elevated side risk is made .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to non @-@ sufficient data to un@@ think@@ able and effectiveness .
in clinical trials , with a cre@@ at@@ ine cle@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min , there were no dose custom@@ iz@@ able , which go beyond the recommended Dos@@ is@@ adap@@ tations .
the data situation in patients with a cre@@ at@@ ine cle@@ ance of less than 45 ml / min was not enough ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with liver function limit of &gt; 1.5 times of the upper Bil@@ ir@@ ub@@ in@@ - limit values and / or trans@@ amin@@ ases from &gt; to 3.0 times the upper limit value ( with the presence of liver cre@@ ases ) are not specifically investigated in the studies .
patients must be monitored in with regard to the bone mar@@ cation and p@@ em@@ et@@ ically must not be administered to patients before the absolute neut@@ rop@@ hil@@ ic count has a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the t@@ rom@@ bo@@ - cy@@ te number has reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dose reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adir of absolute neut@@ rop@@ hil@@ ic number and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity as they were observed in the previous treatment cycles - ( see section 4.2 ) .
a lower tox@@ icity and a reduction of degree 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity such as Neut@@ rop@@ enia , f@@ eb@@ r@@ ile neut@@ rop@@ enia and infection with degrees 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ enia was considered as a pre@@ treatment with foli@@ c acid and vitamin B12 .
therefore , all patients treated with P@@ em@@ et@@ ically treated patients , foli@@ c acid and vitamin B12 as proph@@ yl@@ - l@@ actic measure for reducing treatment @-@ related tox@@ icity ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to medium kidney in@@ suff@@ iciency ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s ) such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and ac@@ et@@ yl@@ s@@ ali@@ - c@@ yl@@ acid ( &gt; 1,3 g daily ) must be the simultaneous intake of non @-@ ster@@ oid anti@@ ph@@ ist@@ ika ( &gt; 1.3 g daily ) for at least 2 days before the therapy , at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ ra@@ xed ( see section 4.5 ) .
all patients who is fore@@ seen for a therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ ically , the intake of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with long half @-@ life time required for at least 5 days before the therapy , the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ bo@@ xed ( see section 4.5 ) .

therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant liquid collection , dra@@ ining in the trans@@ cell@@ ular space a dra@@ ining of the ergonom@@ ics in front of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re @-@ treatment .
5 serious cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events were reported in clinical trials with P@@ em@@ et@@ ically occasionally , if this active ingre@@ dient was usually given in combination with a different cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic drug .
for this reason , the simultaneous application atten@@ u@@ ed Life di@@ mp@@ s ( except yellow fever , these vacc@@ ination is non @-@ inde@@ xed ) not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
as the possibility of an ir@@ reversible cran@@ ial ability of re@@ productive capacity should be rejected , men should be rejected in case of treatment , advice on sper@@ ity reservation .
in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) , high doses of non @-@ ster@@ oid anti@@ ph@@ log@@ ist@@ ika ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s ) and ac@@ et@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ ylic acid in high dosage ( ≥ 1,3 g daily ) to a reduced P@@ em@@ et@@ re @-@ separation with a consequence of several effects of side effects .
attention is careful when patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ ine cle@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ ylic acid can be applied in high dosage .
I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or ac@@ et@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ - acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and reduction , 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ ically avoided ( see section 4.4 ) .
since there are no data relating to the shareholder potential with N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with long half @-@ term such as Pi@@ ro@@ x@@ x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous application must be avoided during therapy , at least 2 days before the therapy , during therapy and at least 2 days after therapy .
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the od@@ ds status during the disease and the possibility of inter@@ actions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplast@@ y chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of IN@@ R ( International standardi@@ zation ratio ) when the decision was made to treat patients with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .

this means that the active ingre@@ dient is prevented by an chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in ) to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines .
Alo@@ xi was studied in three main studies on 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ies , which are strong and moderate trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting .
for chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ies , the strong trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of the patients who were treated with al@@ xi had no vom@@ iting ( 132 from 223 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron patients ( 126 of 221 ) .
at chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ies , the moderate trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , 81 % of the patients were treated with al@@ xi in the 24 hours following chemotherapy alone ( 153 of 189 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) .
for a comparison with d@@ as@@ et@@ ron , these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 from 191 patients ) .
March 2005 , the European Commission announced the company of Helsinki Bi@@ rex Pharmaceuticals Ltd . a approval for the market placing of Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union .
Alo@@ xi is inde@@ xed : for prevention of acute nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting at strongly em@@ eto@@ gen@@ ic chemotherapy due to cancer disease and vom@@ iting in moderate chemotherapy due to cancer disease .
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi for prevention of nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , which is produced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ gen@@ ic chemotherapy alone , can be strengthened by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids .
da Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can extend the col@@ dar@@ mp@@ ass@@ age , patients with an@@ am@@ nesty Ob@@ lig@@ ation or signs of Sub@@ ject I@@ le@@ us should be monitored after inj@@ ections .
as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 @-@ ant@@ agon@@ ists , however , cau@@ tion of the same gift of palm os@@ et@@ ron with pharmac@@ euticals , which extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients with which the Q@@ T@@ - interval is pro@@ long or one extension .
in connection with another chemical agents , Alo@@ xi shall neither be used to treat nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting in the days after chemotherapy .
in pre@@ clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron conduc@@ ts the activity of the five evaluated chem@@ o@@ therapeu@@ tics ( cis@@ plat@@ in , Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ clo@@ ak , D@@ ox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ yc@@ in C ) .
a clinical study showed no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ et@@ ical interaction between one @-@ time intraven@@ ous dose of palm @-@ os@@ et@@ ron and a ste@@ ady Met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pr@@ am@@ ids , a CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors .
in one of a population based pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ et@@ etic analysis was shown that the simultaneous gift of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ inhibit@@ ors ( dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one , an@@ odi@@ zed , r@@ it@@ ab@@ id@@ l , r@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , r@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , ser@@ tr@@ al@@ ine and Ter@@ b@@ af@@ ine ) had no significant effect on the cle@@ aring of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experiences about the application of pall@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ an@@ cies lie not before , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be applied for pregnant women unless it is necessary to be used by the treated doctor .
clinical studies were the most common in a dose of 250 micro@@ grams to observe adverse events ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which stood at least Alo@@ xi in connection , head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and Ob@@ lig@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) of survival actions and reactions on the administration site ( burning , har@@ dening , complaints and pain ) were given in post @-@ marketing experience .
in the group with the highest dosage , similar to adverse events were shown as in the other dosing groups ; there were no dose effects relationships .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were carried out due to the large distribution volume , however , there is probably no effective therapy at a Alo@@ xi@@ - surplus dosage .
in two random@@ ized double @-@ blind studies , 1,@@ 132 mg / m2 Cis@@ plat@@ in , car@@ b@@ op@@ lat@@ in , ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 Cis@@ plat@@ in , car@@ b@@ op@@ lat@@ ron ( half @-@ time 4 hours ) or 100 mg of Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ time 7.3 hours ) received , that was given an intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ously to Day 1 .
in a randomised double @-@ blind study , 667 patients who received a strongly em@@ eto@@ gen@@ ic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ b@@ azine of 250 or 750 mc@@ g of pall@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron received with patients compared to which 32 mg of On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron were given that day 1 intraven@@ ously .
results of studies with moderate chemotherapy and the study of strongly em@@ eto@@ gen@@ ic chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables .
in clinical studies to the indication of chemotherapy @-@ induced nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of palm @-@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters were comparable with the corresponding effects of On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
after the wo@@ unds of clinical research , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion@@ ic and Rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation involved in the vent@@ ri@@ cular de@@ formation and extend the duration of the shareholder potential .
the aim of the study carried out at 221 healthy volunteers were the assessment of the EC@@ G @-@ effects of i.@@ f. @-@ slight pall@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.25 , 0,@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
res@@ or@@ ption According to intraven@@ ous gift follows a slow decrease of plasma concentrations a slow elimination of the body with an average initial half @-@ time period of about 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the surface under the concentration of concentr@@ ating period ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally proportional in the entire dose range from 0.@@ 3- 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients .
following an intraven@@ ous gift of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the median mean ( ± SD ) increase in Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration at 42 ± 34 % .
pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic sim@@ ulations indicates that once a daily intraven@@ ous gift of 0.25 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron reached a total value of 0.25 mg of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on 3 consecutive days ; however , the C@@ max after the inser@@ tion of 0.75 mg was higher .
about 40 % are eliminated on the kidneys and approximately another 50 % are converted into two primary metabol@@ ites that have less than 1 % of ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor .
in @-@ vitro studies for metabol@@ isation , CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 is involved in lower dimensions that are involved in the metabolism of palm @-@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elimination of a intraven@@ ous dose of 10 mc@@ g / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were found approximately 80 % of the dose within 144 hours in urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as un@@ changeable ingre@@ dient made about 40 % of the given dose .
after a unique intraven@@ ous bol@@ ted injection in healthy , the total body size was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al cle@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
indeed , in patients with severe liver function , the terminal reduction of Eli@@ min@@ os@@ et@@ ron increases the average system@@ ic exposition with pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , however , a reduction of the dose is not justified .
in clinical studies , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions that are considered adequate above the maximum human@@ ist exposure , which indicates a small relev@@ ance for clinical use .
10 out of a clinical studies suggest that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can block only in very high concentrations of I@@ on@@ ite channels , which can extend to the vent@@ ri@@ cular De@@ - und Rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation , and extend the action of action .
high doses Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose resulted in some 30 times of therapeutic exposure to people ) , which have been given daily for two years , led to a ver@@ itable frequency of liver tum@@ ors , end@@ ocr@@ ine Ne@@ op@@ las@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid , p@@ itu@@ itary , pan@@ cre@@ er@@ mark ) and skin tum@@ ors with rats , but not with mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not completely unknown , but due to the used high doses and that Alo@@ xi is determined for one @-@ time application , the relev@@ ance of these results are considered low for men .

in June 2006 , the Committee of Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative report in which the prevention of regulatory approval for the treatment of hepatitis C provided by Alp@@ he@@ on 6 million IE / ml injection solution was recommended .
this means that Alp@@ he@@ on of an organic medicine named Ro@@ feron @-@ A should be similar to the same medicine named Ro@@ feron @-@ A , which is already approved in the EU ( also called reference laboratory use &quot; ) .
Alp@@ he@@ on should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic ( long an@@ hal@@ ted ) hepatitis C ( one by virus infection ) .
in a micro@@ scop@@ ic investigation , the liver tissue damage can also be increased to the values of the liver enzymes Al@@ an@@ in@@ - Amin@@ ot@@ ran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) in the blood .
it is produced by a yeast into which a gene ( DNA ) was added to the formation of the active ingre@@ dient .
the manufacturers of Alp@@ he@@ on laid data in front of the fields of Alp@@ he@@ on with Ro@@ feron @-@ A ( active structure , composition , and purity of medicines , effects , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) .
in the study on patients with hepatitis C , the efficacy of Alp@@ he@@ on was compared to 455 patients with the effectiveness of the reference operation .
the study was measured as many patients after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks as well as 6 months after the treatment of the medicine ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) .

furthermore , concerns all concerns , the data on the stability of the active ingre@@ dient and the drug are not sufficient .
the number of patients with hepatitis C , similar to the treatment with Alp@@ he@@ on and Ro@@ feron @-@ A , was similar in clinical study .
after adjusting the treatment with Alp@@ he@@ on , the disease was infl@@ amed more than at the reference agent ; Moreover , Alp@@ he@@ on had more side effects .
apart from this study , the medicine was used to investigate how far the medicine forms an immune response ( i.e. the bodies ) bodies - special proteins - against the medicine ) , not suff@@ ici@@ ently vali@@ dated .
it can be used for the treatment of Imp@@ et@@ igo ( one with cr@@ aters ) and small infected Laz@@ ar@@ ities ( R@@ iss@@ - or chi@@ ves ) , di@@ ced and inclined wo@@ unds .
Al@@ tar@@ go is not to be used for treatment of infections , caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( M@@ RSA ) , because al@@ go does not affect this type of infections .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be applied for patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under 18 years , the skin surface must not exceed 2 % of the body surface .
if the patient does not respond to treatment after two to three days , the doctor should examine the patient once and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking the bacterial Ri@@ bos@@ omes ( parts of the bacterial cell that proteins produces ) and in@@ hibit the growth of bacteria .
principal Indi@@ k@@ ator of the efficacy was in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection had been cl@@ ed after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of the 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients under placebo to the treatment .
in the treatment of infected skin wo@@ unds , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in similar response rates : if the results of both studies were taken together by skin @-@ wo@@ unds , some 90 % of the patients were inter@@ connected to the treatment .
however , in these two studies , however , Al@@ tar@@ go has been identified during the treatment of wast@@ eland ( eit@@ ed cav@@ ities in the body tissue ) or infections , causing det@@ ec@@ table or presumably caused by M@@ RSA , not effective enough .
the most common side effects of Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a matur@@ ation at the contractor .
at the conclusion , the Committee for Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the advantages of Al@@ tar@@ go was over@@ thrown in short @-@ time treatment of the following super@@ ficial skin infections : • Imp@@ et@@ igo , • infected little Laz@@ ar@@ ations , di@@ ced or bru@@ te wo@@ unds .
may 2007 , the European Commission announced the company Gla@@ xo Group Ltd . a approval for the market launch of Al@@ tar@@ go in the entire European Union .
patients who shows no improvements within two to three days , are supposed to be examined and considered an alternative therapy to be considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
in case of a Sen@@ si@@ bil@@ isation or serious local irrit@@ ation by the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be the treatment is broken down , the oint@@ ment should be carefully un@@ certain@@ ties and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection .
ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be applied to treatment of infections where M@@ RSA is known as a path@@ ogen , or suspected of infections ( see section 5.1 ) .
clinical studies with ph@@ thal@@ mic open wo@@ unds was the efficacy of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections , caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( M@@ RSA ) .
an alternative therapy is to be considered as after a 2- or 3 @-@ day treatment no improvements or deteri@@ oration of the infected area .
the effect of simultaneous use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical funds on the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous application of other top@@ ical medicines is not recommended .
due to the low plasma concentrations , which were achieved when humans have been reached after top@@ ical application , a clin@@ ically relevant inhibit@@ or in vi@@ vo is not expected ( see section 5.2 ) .
3 After the simultaneous gift of 2 times a day , 200 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole increased the medium ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max after top@@ ical application of 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ be increased from healthy adult men by 81 % .
due to the low system@@ ic exposure after top@@ ical application in patients , dose @-@ adap@@ tations are not considered necessary when top@@ ical ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is applied during an system@@ ic treatment with CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a re@@ productive tox@@ icity after oral care and are in@@ sufficient to affect a statement on the birth and the f@@ og@@ ale / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ be should only be applied during pregnancy , when an top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly inde@@ xed and the application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is able to make an system@@ ic anti@@ bi@@ otic treatment .
in the decision whether the breast@@ feeding has continued / termin@@ ate or termin@@ ate the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go , is between the benefit of the n@@ urs@@ ing for the mamm@@ ling and the benefits of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy to the woman .
in clinical studies of 2@@ 150 patients with super@@ ficial skin infections , which applied Al@@ tar@@ go , was the most frequently reported side effects of Ir@@ rit@@ ation on the administration site that were approximately 1 % of the patients .
effects of effects ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ atives of P@@ and@@ rom@@ util@@ ine , a substance that is isolated by fermentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ ilus pas@@ se@@ ck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ k@@ ot@@ us pas@@ se@@ ck@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the drug mechanism of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on the sel@@ ective inhibit@@ ing of bacterial protein synthesis based on a particular binding center of the 50s sub @-@ unit of bacterial Ri@@ bos@@ omes , which differs from the ties of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ mitt@@ ent anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicate that the Bin@@ ding agent ri@@ bos@@ om@@ ales Protein L3 is involved and in the region of ri@@ bos@@ om@@ alen P bin@@ ders and pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ transferred to the centre of Pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ transferred .
by linking to this bin@@ ing centre , P@@ and@@ rom@@ util@@ ine blocks the pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ actic transfer , block part inter@@ actions and prevent normal formation of active 50s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub @-@ units .
due to the local preval@@ ence of resistance to the application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin , the application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should appear at least some inf@@ ection forms , it should be targeted by experts .
there were no differences in in @-@ vitro activity of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , ir@@ respective of whether the ins@@ ate is sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in case of failure on the treatment of S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tribes generated with additional vir@@ ul@@ enz@@ y factors ( like PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
res@@ or@@ ption in a study with healthy adults was 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ be daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion on in@@ tak@@ te and sh@@ aken skin for up to 7 days .
of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , the 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ be twice daily for 5 days in the top@@ ical treatment of secondary trau@@ mat@@ ism , single plasma samples were obtained .
the sampling was carried out on days 3 or 4 in adult patients each before the medication and children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual system@@ ic intake of people after top@@ ical application of 1 % Sal@@ be increased to 200 cm2 ( C@@ max = 22 n@@ g / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 n@@ g · h / ml ) 660 times lower than the ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP inhibit@@ ing .

in studies for oral tox@@ icity of rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ roid changes .

Am@@ bi@@ rix is used to protect against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases , the liver affects ) in children aged between one and 15 years that are still not immune to these two diseases .
Am@@ bi@@ rix is used within a framework of two doses of existing vacc@@ inations , whereby a protection against hepatitis B may not be reached after administration of the second dose .
for this reason , Am@@ bi@@ rix can only be used when immun@@ isation is a low risk of hepatitis B infection and is ensured that the vacc@@ ination of two doses can be brought to the end .
if a review is given against hepatitis A or B , Am@@ bi@@ rix or other hepatitis B or -@@ B vaccine can be given .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; vacc@@ ines will work with the immune system ( the natural movement of the body ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how it can lead to a disease . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system has the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; strange &quot; and produces anti@@ bodies .
Am@@ bi@@ rix contains the same components as the Twin@@ rix adult vaccine and has been approved in the Twin@@ rix Children since 1997 .
the three vacc@@ ines are applied to protection against the same diseases , Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are administered during three doses of the vacc@@ ination schedule .
because Am@@ bi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data that supports the application of Twin@@ rix adults , also known as a cover for the application of Am@@ bi@@ rix .
the main inde@@ b@@ ator for the effectiveness was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a month after the last injection of anti @-@ protected anti@@ bodies .
in an additional study with 208 children , the effectiveness of the vaccine was compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 month distance between the two inj@@ ections compared .
Am@@ bi@@ rix resulted in between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children a month after the last injection to develop hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Am@@ bi@@ rix at a six @-@ six @-@ month distance between the inj@@ ections was similar .
the most common side effects of Am@@ bi@@ rix ( ob@@ serves more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses ) are head@@ aches , appet@@ ite , pain on the injection point , red@@ ness , fatigue ) and irrit@@ ability .
Am@@ bi@@ rix may not react with patients who are possibly super@@ sensitive to the active substances , one of the other components or Ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( an anti@@ bi@@ otic ) .
in August 2002 , the European Commission issued Gla@@ x@@ o@@ Smith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ olog@@ om@@ s.@@ a. for an authorization for the placing of Am@@ bi@@ rix in the entire
the standardi@@ zation plan for the Grun@@ dig mun@@ itions with Am@@ bi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ inations , whereby the first dose is administered at the date of choice and the second dose between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a collection imp@@ lic@@ ates both for hepatitis A and hepatitis B can be vacc@@ inated with the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or with a combined vaccine .
the anti @-@ hepatitis B@@ - Surface an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) anti@@ bodies are in the same magn@@ itude according to vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
it is not completely secured , whether immune competent people who have a hepatitis B vaccine , which may be protected as a protection , as they may not be protected by the immune memory .
3 As for all inj@@ ections , an an@@ aph@@ yl@@ actic reaction should always be available immediately after the gift of the vacc@@ ination of the vacc@@ ination of medical treatment and monitoring .
if a faster protection against hepatitis B is recommended , the standardi@@ mp@@ f@@ sch@@ ema is recommended with the combination simple , the 360 ELISA @-@ units form@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg of combined hepatitis B surface .
in hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the immune system , there is no sufficient anti @-@ HAV@@ ER and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibody that may be necessary in these cases the gift of other vacc@@ ines may be necessary .
since an intra@@ ocular injection or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration in the glut@@ eal muscles could lead to a sub@@ optimal im@@ perfec@@ tions , these inj@@ ections should be avoided .
however , in Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ t@@ open@@ ia or ble@@ eding distur@@ ban@@ ces , Am@@ bi@@ rix can be inj@@ ected , as it can be inj@@ ected after in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular gift to ble@@ eding in these cases .
when Am@@ bi@@ rix was administered in the form of a separate injection , tet@@ an@@ us@@ - and Ha@@ em@@ oph@@ ilus influenza type b @-@ vaccine ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or with a combined mas@@ cul@@ um m@@ umps k@@ illings , the immune response was sufficient to all anti@@ gens ( see section 5.1 ) .
patients with immun@@ oh@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immun@@ ode@@ ficiency must be assumed that possibly no sufficient immune response is achieved .
in a clinical study conducted with 3 vacc@@ inations of these formulation , the frequency of pain , red@@ ness , sw@@ elling , gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ itis , head@@ ache and fever comparable with the frequency given at the previous Thi@@ omer@@ sal@@ - and preserv@@ ative vaccine form@@ ulating was observed .
in clinical studies , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ ines of Am@@ bi@@ rix were administered at a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ inations ranging from 1 to 15 years .
in a study with 300 participants at the age of 12 and including 15 years the toler@@ ability of Am@@ bi@@ rix was compared with the 3 @-@ cans combination simple .
the only excep@@ tions were the higher level of pain and sail@@ ors on a calculation basis per vaccine dose Am@@ bi@@ rix , but not on a date of calculation per person .
pain was observed in the gift of Am@@ bi@@ rix at 5@@ 0.7 % of the subjects , compared with 3@@ 9.1 % in subjects according to the gift of a dose of 3 doses combined .
according to the complete vacc@@ ination cycle 6@@ 6.4 % of subjects who had given Am@@ bi@@ rix had to get over pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % for the subjects that were vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ Dos@@ - combined fuel .
however , the frequency of matter was comparable per pro@@ band ( i.e. over the entire vacc@@ ination cycle at 3@@ 9.6 % of subjects that received Am@@ bi@@ rix , compared with 3@@ 6.2 % with the subjects that received the 3 @-@ doses combined ) .
the incidence of pronoun@@ ced pain and matter was low and similar to the administration of the combined vaccine with the 3 @-@ cans vacc@@ ination .
in a comparative study of 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ old vacc@@ ines was comparable to Am@@ bi@@ ri@@ x@@ Group , with which was observed in administration with the 3 @-@ cans combination inter@@ mitt@@ ently with 360 ELISA units form@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface .
however , during the 6- to 11@@ - year old , however , vacc@@ ination with Am@@ bi@@ rix was reported to have a common occurr@@ ence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per speaker .
the share of vacc@@ inations that reported on serious side effects during the 2 @-@ cans vacc@@ ination with am@@ bi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ cans vacc@@ ination of hepatitis A virus and 10 µg re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B@@ - Surface an@@ tigen reported , was statistically not different .
in clinical studies that were carried out in vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 - including 15 years , ser@@ op@@ o@@ con@@ sions rates for anti @-@ H@@ AV 9@@ 9.1 % had a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , for the month 6 ab@@ out@@ ten dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
the output rates for anti @-@ H@@ BS were 7@@ 4,2 % one month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , for the month 6 ab@@ sent dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a comparative study that was conducted at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 have received two doses of Am@@ bi@@ rix and 147 the standard combinations of three doses .
at the 289 people whose immun@@ ogen@@ icity were measured , ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in table below ) were significantly higher in the month 2 and 6 after the gift of the 3 @-@ dose imp@@ lic@@ it significantly higher than with Am@@ bi@@ rix .
the immune response , which were achieved in a clinical study of 1 @-@ 11 year @-@ olds a month after the full vacc@@ ination series ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table .
in both studies the vacc@@ ines received either a 2 @-@ cans vacc@@ ination with am@@ bi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ cans vacc@@ ination with 360 ELISA units form@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10@@ µg re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface .
for persons who were at the time of Grun@@ dig mun@@ itions between 12 and 15 years old , the Per@@ sist@@ ence of anti @-@ Hav@@ ai@@ ds and anti @-@ H@@ BS anti @-@ anti@@ bodies could be demonstrated in the 0 @-@ 6 months of vacc@@ ination .
in this study observed immune reaction against both anti@@ gens was comparable to vacc@@ ination of 3 doses with a combined Hepat@@ it@@ is@@ - A @-@ Virus and 10 µg re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study of 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ HAV@@ ER and anti @-@ H@@ BS anti@@ bodies are similar to immun@@ isation in the 0 @-@ 6 months of vacc@@ ination .
when the first dose of Am@@ bi@@ rix in the second year of life at the same time , the vacc@@ ination of a combined dip vaccine , in@@ activated poli@@ omyel@@ itis and 8 Ha@@ em@@ oph@@ ilus influenza vacc@@ ines was administered , the immune response was sufficient to all anti@@ gens .
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the present formulation of adults , showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection and ser@@ op@@ press@@ rates as for previous formulation .
the vaccine is both before and after the res@@ us@@ ement of the eye contact with any foreign particles and / or physi@@ cally visible changes .

the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted by vir@@ al foods and drinks , but can also be transferred by other ways , such as by Baden in through wast@@ ew@@ ater waters .
you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , blu@@ ish face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( j@@ aun@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may require a stationary treatment .
as with all vacc@@ ines , Am@@ bi@@ rix can not protect entirely from infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus , even if the complete vaccine series was completed with 2 doses .
if you have been infected with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus in front of the administration of both vacc@@ ines Am@@ bi@@ rix are already infected with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus ( though you don &apos;t feel un@@ comfortable or sick at vacc@@ ination time ) , a vacc@@ ination may not prevent any illness .
a protection against other infections which cause the liver damage or symptoms that are similar to those of hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection , cannot be convey@@ ed .
• For if you have an allergic reaction to Am@@ bi@@ rix or any part of this vaccine , including Ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( an anti@@ bi@@ otic ) .
an allergic reaction can express through ju@@ ck@@ ily skin irrit@@ ation , breathing problems or sw@@ elling of the face or tongue . • if you have occurred an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B . • if you have a child or severe infection with fever .
• If you want to have a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and prior to the administration of the second vacc@@ ines dose ) .
at a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will give you / your child from an vacc@@ ination with Am@@ bi@@ rix rates .
instead , he will recommend 3 inj@@ ections of a combin@@ ated hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced salary of an associated hepatitis C virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface anti@@ gens ( hepatitis B surface anti@@ gens ) .
the second vacc@@ ination dose of this vaccine is usually given to a month after the first dose and should give you a vacc@@ ination protection against the vacc@@ ination of the vacc@@ ination series .
sometimes , Am@@ bi@@ rix are suffering from severe ble@@ eding distur@@ ban@@ ces , under the skin and not into the muscle . • if you are weak@@ ened / her child due to a disease or treatment in your own entity , or if you / your child is under@@ going to under@@ go / under@@ go your child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Am@@ bi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these persons can not be enough , so that a bub@@ bles may be necessary to see how strong the response is due to vacc@@ ination . &quot; &quot; &quot;
21 If you receive your doctor if you receive / or receive further medicines ( including those who have been vacc@@ inated without disappearance ) or if you have been vacc@@ inated without pres@@ cription ( anti@@ bodies ) , or im@@ m@@ ung@@ lob@@ ine ( anti@@ bodies ) has been given to / or that is planned in the near future .
but it may be that in this case the immune response is not sufficient for the vaccine and the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine is given simultaneously with Am@@ bi@@ rix , should be vacc@@ inated with separate places and as possible as possible various li@@ mb@@ s .
if Am@@ bi@@ rix are given at the same time or shortly before or after a injection of Im@@ m@@ ung@@ lob@@ ins , it is likely to be sufficient that the response to the vaccine will be enough .
usually Am@@ bi@@ rix pregnant or l@@ act@@ ating women are not administered , except it is ur@@ gent , that they vacc@@ inated both against hepatitis A and hepatitis B .
important information on certain other types of Am@@ bi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you have shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( anti@@ bi@@ otic ) .
if you miss the agreed appointment for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and make a new date as soon as possible .
♦ very frequent ( more than 1 case per 10 vacc@@ inated doses ) : • pain or complaints at the injection point or tube • Dum@@ pl@@ bility • head@@ ache • App@@ et@@ it@@ gel

Am@@ bi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and packs to 50 without need@@ les .
based on the data , which has become known since the first approval of the market for placing on the market , the CH@@ MP has been positive that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Am@@ bi@@ rix remains positive .
however , Am@@ bi@@ rix was only limited to a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this medicine is limited to low patient exposure .
am@@ mon@@ ers can also be used in patients at the age of a month with in@@ complete enzyme defect or hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ astic en@@ cep@@ halopath@@ y ( Hir@@ n@@ ants due to high glucose concentrations ) in the pre@@ history .
am@@ mon@@ ers - split by several single doses at meals - swal@@ lowed up , under the meat mixed or via a gast@@ ro@@ om@@ i@@ esch@@ i ( through the stomach @-@ leading hose ) or a no@@ bl@@ onde ( through the nose in the stomach @-@ leading hose ) .
no comparative study , as children of Ammon didn &apos;t be compared to other treatment or placebo ( a pseud@@ o @-@ medicine , i.e. without substance ) .
also , the children of am@@ ers can also lead to appet@@ ite , depression , head@@ ache , f@@ ooth@@ ache , liqu@@ or , nau@@ sea , nau@@ sea , nau@@ sea , const@@ ip@@ ation , r@@ ying , r@@ ash , r@@ ut@@ ant body od@@ or , or weight gain .
in the conclusion , the Committee for Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that am@@ aps may effectively prevents am@@ mon@@ ohydr@@ ate values in patients with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the ur@@ inary cycle .
under &quot; extraordinary circumstances , the children of Ammon was approved , since due to the condition of the disease at the time of approval only limited information on this medic@@ inal templates .
the use is inde@@ xed to all patients with which a complete enzyme had been manifested in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
in patients with late mani@@ fold form ( in@@ complete enzyme defect , which is manifested after the first life of life ) , there is an indication for the use when in the An@@ am@@ ity a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ astic em@@ missible spongiform encephalopath@@ y .
for infants , for children who are not able to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with can@@ opy disorders , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in granite .
the daily dose is individually calculated under consideration of the protein toler@@ ant and the development of necessary daily protein intake of the patient .
according to previous clinical experiences the normal daily dose of sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with a body weight of less than 20 kg / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg , as well as with herr@@ ing and adults .
in patients who suff@@ ici@@ ently suffer from an early firm to Car@@ b@@ am@@ yl@@ phosph@@ at@@ synthetic fur or Or@@ ni@@ thin@@ as@@ yn@@ b@@ am@@ yl@@ ase , is the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ y@@ line or Ar@@ gin@@ ine , is required in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
patients with a arg@@ in@@ os@@ u@@ cc@@ ini defic@@ iency need Ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.4 to 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15,@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be given to patients with hat@@ ch disorders , as a risk for the emergence of Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ ag@@ us@@ zer@@ a exists if the tablets are not immediately coming into the stomach .
every tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be used in patients with con@@ gest@@ i@@ ver heart failure or severe kidney failure , as well as with sodium injury and oil formation only with cau@@ tion .
because Met@@ abol@@ isation and separation of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat about the liver and the kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should be used in patients with liver or kidney failure .
the importance of this results in terms of pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore con@@ tra @-@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in sub@@ cut@@ aneous gift of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate to young rats ( 190 - 474 mg / kg ) , a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal deteri@@ oration and increased loss of neur@@ ons .
it also found a delayed matur@@ ation of cer@@ eb@@ r@@ alen syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of working neur@@ ons in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
it could not be found if phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate is eliminated in the breast milk , and from this reason is the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during a n@@ urs@@ ing time ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , 56 % of patients showed at least one undes@@ ired event ( AE ) and at 78 % of this un@@ wanted events that they were not associated with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , commonly ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a more likely toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 year old ano@@ re@@ tic patients who developed an metab@@ olic en@@ cep@@ halopath@@ y in conjunction with Lak@@ tat@@ azi@@ el , he@@ avier hypo@@ ath@@ y , arm@@ ist@@ ochem@@ istry , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ y and pan@@ cre@@ at@@ itis .
a case of over@@ rides occurred at a 5 @-@ month small child with a se@@ eable single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms walk with the accum@@ ulation of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate , which showed an intraven@@ ous neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity with an intraven@@ ous administration of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day .
Phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate is a metab@@ olic active connection , con@@ jug@@ ated through ac@@ et@@ y@@ et@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with glut@@ amine to phenol , which is left over the kidneys .
Phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine seen in urea with urea ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ ric at@@ oms ) ; Phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier to the extension of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the ur@@ inary cycle can be assumed that for each gram of gen@@ om@@ men@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat between 0,@@ 12 and 0.15 g Phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine @-@ nitrogen are produced .
it is of importance that the diagnosis was early and started to improve the survival chances and improve the clinical outcome .
the progn@@ osis of the early @-@ mani@@ fold form of the disease with the first symptoms in the new@@ born age was almost always inf@@ aust , and the disease resulted in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their st@@ ick@@ ener anal@@ ogues within the first year of life to death .
by hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the util@@ isation of alternative way of nitrogen oxide ( sodium chloride , sodium ) and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids , it was possible to increase the survival rate of neu@@ tered at post@@ part@@ al ( however within the first month ) diagnostic diseases to 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even during these patients it came with time with many spiritual disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its .
in patients with late mani@@ fold form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ ous membrane form of the Or@@ ni@@ thin@@ tran@@ spl@@ yl@@ en@@ am@@ yl@@ ase defic@@ iency ) , which were treated by a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ astic end spongiform encephalopath@@ y and a protein reduced diet , the survival rate was 98 % .
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible in the treatment and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of the neuro@@ logical state activity may occur .
it is known that Phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is oxi@@ di@@ zed to Phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate , which is con@@ jug@@ ated in liver and kidney disease with glut@@ amine , with phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and prim@@ ates were determined according to the gift of a single dose of 5 g sodium hydro@@ chlor@@ ophyll and with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis in detail as well as repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( not controlled trials ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metast@@ asis was also examined at cancer patients according to intraven@@ ous gift of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate .
after a oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in tablets were determined 15 minutes after intake plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat .
when the majority of patients with ur@@ inary cells or hem@@ ic@@ glo@@ bin@@ opath@@ ies was det@@ ec@@ table according to various doses of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) on the next morning , no phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate in plasma .
in three of six patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis , which were repeated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 20 g / day oral in three single doses ) , the average Phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ at@@ concentrations were treated at Plas@@ m@@ asp@@ iegel at the third day five times higher than after the first gifts .
the medication will be eliminated within 24 hours to about 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ jug@@ ated product phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests , sodium chloride was not treated with toxic and non @-@ toxic effects ( investigation 24 and 48 h according to oral administration of an individual dose of 8@@ 78 to 2800 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules is taken either for oral ( infants and children who can have no tablets , or patients with hat@@ ch disorders ) or via a gast@@ ro bl@@ onde .
according to previous clinical experiences the normal daily dose of sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with body weight less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as with herr@@ ing and adults .
the concentration of ammonia , arg@@ in@@ ine , essential amino acids ( in particular bran@@ ched chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um protein should be kept within the normal range .
in patients who suff@@ ici@@ ently suffer from an early firm to Car@@ b@@ am@@ yl@@ phosph@@ at@@ synthetic fur or Or@@ ni@@ thin@@ as@@ yn@@ b@@ am@@ yl@@ ase , is the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ y@@ line or Ar@@ gin@@ ine , is required in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5,4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
when rat feder@@ ated before the birth of Phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate ( active Met@@ abo@@ lit from Phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) , it came to les@@ ions in the pyramid of the Hir@@ n@@ r@@ inde .
a more likely toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 year old ano@@ re@@ tic patients who developed an metab@@ olic en@@ cep@@ halopath@@ y in conjunction with Lak@@ tat@@ azi@@ el , he@@ avier hypo@@ ath@@ y , arm@@ ist@@ ochem@@ istry , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ y and pan@@ cre@@ at@@ itis .
Phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine seen in urea with urea ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ ric at@@ oms ) ; Phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier to the loss of excess
on the basis of investigations on the analysis of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the ur@@ inary cycle can be assumed that for each gram of gen@@ om@@ men@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat between 0,@@ 12 and 0.15 g Phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine @-@ nitrogen are produced .
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible in treatment , and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of the neuro@@ logical state activity may occur .
after a oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form , 15 minutes after intake increased plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat .
during the duration of durability , the patient can store the finished product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not over 25 ° C .
at this approach the small measuring spoon 0,@@ 95 g , the middle measuring spoon of 2.9 g and the big measuring spoon of 8.6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat .
if a patient has to receive the medicine via a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water ( the sol@@ ub@@ ility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases are missing certain liver enzymes , so that they can &apos;t separate the waste of proteins in the body after consumption of proteins in the body .
if you have carried out laboratory studies , you must notify the physician you need to take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat can influence the results of certain laboratory studies .
when taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ists if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken non @-@ pres@@ cription drug .
while n@@ urs@@ ing time you may not take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as the medicine should over@@ pass the breast milk and harm your baby damage .
in rare cases also confusion , head@@ ache , flav@@ ours , ref@@ usal of secret , des@@ serts , expression disorders , and deteri@@ oration of existing neuro@@ logical states .
if you determine one of these symptoms , use immediately with your doctor or with the emergency recording of your hospital for the introduction of a corresponding treatment in connection .
if you forget the intake of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal .

An@@ gi@@ ox is used to treat patients with &quot; acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ us &quot; ( ACS , reduced blood circulation ) , for example when inst@@ abil@@ ty ang@@ ina ( heart attack ) or m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; ST@@ - Heb@@ ung &quot; ( a an@@ om@@ al measured value for electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) .
An@@ gi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients who should under@@ go to a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the infusion can be continued until four hours after the procedure .
this can contribute to patients with Ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study about the treatment of An@@ gi@@ ox in sole gift or in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( G@@ PI , a different medicines for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) with traditional combination treatment with Hep@@ arin ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans ) and a G@@ PI .
during the PCI the patient frequently used a st@@ ent ( a short tube that remains in the arter@@ ies to prevent a closure ) and they received additional medicines for preventing blood cl@@ ots , such as Ab@@ ci@@ xim@@ ab and aspir@@ in .
in the treatment of ACS was An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without the gift of new events ( deaths , heart attack or Rev@@ as@@ cular@@ isation ) after 30 days or a year as effective as conventional treatment .
in patients who were subjected to a PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox was equally effective in terms of indicators as effective as Hep@@ arin , with severe ble@@ eding , with which it was significantly more effective than Hep@@ arin .
An@@ gi@@ ox may not be used in patients who may be over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine , other Hir@@ ud@@ ine , or one of the other components .
it may not be used in patients who recently had a blood circulation , as well as people with strong hyper@@ tension or severe kidney problems or a heart infection .
at the conclusion , the Committee for Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that An@@ gi@@ ox is at the treatment of ACS and during a PCI for a replacement for Hep@@ arin .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued the Company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd . an authorization for the placing of An@@ gi@@ ox in the entire European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ us ( inst@@ ab@@ ile Ang@@ ina / Non @-@ ST @-@ mid@@ range ) ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) in an emergency handle or when an early intervention is fore@@ seen .
the recommended initial dose of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with ACS is a intraven@@ ous Bol@@ us@@ ability of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h .
if a PCI is performed in another result , an additional Bol@@ us of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the infusion for the duration of the surgery to 1,@@ 75 mg / kg / h should be increased .
according to the PCI , the reduced in@@ infusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h again can be recorded for 4 to 12 hours .
directly before the procedure is to be administered by 0.5 mg / kg , followed by an infusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention .
the recommended dosage of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of a initi@@ ator intraven@@ ous bol@@ ster of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and one of these intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous infusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
the safety and effectiveness of a sole Bol@@ us gift by An@@ gi@@ ox was not examined and is not recommended , even if a short PCI procedure is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) was shortened to under 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body@@ weight should be carried out .
in order to reduce the occurr@@ ence of low ACT values , the re@@ constituted and di@@ lu@@ ent medicines should be carefully mixed and administered intraven@@ ously intraven@@ ously .
once the ACT amounts to more than 225 seconds , a further monitoring is not necessary , provided , the 1,@@ 75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered correctly .
in patients with moderate kidney @-@ restriction ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subjected to a PCI ( whether bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine was treated with ACS or not ) , a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used .
if the ACT value is under 225 seconds , a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and exam@@ ining the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt of Bol@@ us@@ ages .
in patients with moderate kidney @-@ compensation , which resulted in phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( Re@@ place @-@ 2 ) , which resulted in approval , the ACT had measured 5 minutes after the gift of the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine Bol@@ us without dose custom@@ ization at an average of 366 ± 89 seconds .
3 In patients with severe kidney @-@ compensation ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also for di@@ aly@@ sis patients , An@@ gi@@ ox con@@ tra@@ ced ( see below section 4.3 ) .
the treatment with an@@ gi@@ ox can be re@@ directed 30 minutes after termination of the intraven@@ ous gift of un@@ fra@@ c@@ tion@@ ated Hep@@ arin or 8 hours after the end of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of a molecular Hep@@ arin .
• Sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ i@@ osity against the active substance or other components or against Hir@@ ud@@ ine • Active blood circulation , or ir@@ reversible hyper@@ tension . • severe un@@ controlled hyper@@ tension ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and di@@ aly@@ sis charges ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and di@@ aly@@ tic patients
patients are carefully treated with respect to symptoms and signs of blood disorders , especially when bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans ( see section 4.5 ) .
even if PCI patients occur under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in most of the arter@@ ial points of arter@@ ial points , the treatment of a per@@ cut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ar@@ intervention ( PCI ) may occur during treatment in principle .
in patients who are treated war@@ far@@ in and treated with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine , a monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International standardi@@ zation ratio ) should be taken to ensure that the value of the treatment with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine reg@@ ained its level before the treatment .
starting from the knowledge about the action of action of anti@@ o@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( Hep@@ arin , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ ol@@ y@@ tics or Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ g@@ ation@@ em@@ mer ) can be assumed that these substances increase the risk of blood .
in combination of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine with t@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ates or anti@@ o@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , clinical and biological hem@@ atology parameters are regularly checked in any case regularly .
the experimental studies are based on the pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , de@@ formation or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
46@@ 12 were randomised to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine alone , 46@@ 04 were randomised to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and 46@@ 03 were random@@ ized to either un@@ fra@@ c@@ tion@@ ated Hep@@ arin or E@@ no@@ x@@ ap@@ arin or G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in Group as well as in the treated groups in patients treated with women and patients more than 65 years were more common in male or younger patients .
severe ble@@ eding were defined according to AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i standards for heavy ble@@ eding as in table 2 .
both light and severe ble@@ eding were significantly fewer than in the groups with Hep@@ arin plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and Bi@@ vali@@ dru@@ din plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a- inhibit@@ or ( see Table 2 ) .
an AC@@ U@@ ITY heavy ble@@ eding was defined as one of the following events , intra@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , hem@@ atology with diameter ≥ 5 g / dl with known blood pressure , reproduction due to ble@@ eding , application of blood products to trans@@ fusion .
further , less frequently observed ble@@ eding loc@@ alis@@ ations that occurred with more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) , &quot; other &quot; scores , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal , ear , nose or neck .
the following information on side effects are based on the data of a clinical study with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine in 6000 patients who under@@ go one PCI .
both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in group as well as in the treated groups in patients treated with women and patients more than 65 years were more common in male or younger patients .
both light and severe ble@@ eding occurred in significantly fewer than in the comparative group under Hep@@ arin plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
the following adverse events that were not listed above were reported after comprehensive application in practice and are combined in Table 6 in Table 6 .
in case of over@@ ation , the treatment with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine reg@@ im@@ ens to monitor and monitor the patient with regard to the signs of a blood pressure .
An@@ gi@@ ox contains Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine , a direct and specific Th@@ rom@@ bin@@ ists , which bin@@ ds both at the catal@@ y@@ tic center as well as in the an@@ ion@@ ic region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , regardless of whether Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ ine is bound in the liquid phase or at Ger@@ inn@@ sel .
the binding of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine in Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and with its effect , is reversible because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in turn off slowly the binding of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine @-@ Arg@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 thereby reducing the function of the active centre of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in .
in addition , through Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine with ser@@ um of patients who arrived in the past to hot @-@ induced thy@@ mo@@ cy@@ t@@ open@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ osis syndrome ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) .
in healthy volunteers and in patients Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine shows the anti @-@ oxid@@ atory effect caused by the extension of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT .
if the patients were performed in the following a PCI , an additional Bol@@ us of 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in was given and the infusion for the duration of the surgery to 1,@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h should be increased .
in the arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , untreated Hep@@ arin or E@@ no@@ x@@ ap@@ arin became relevant to relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute Cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ syndrome ( ACS ) in patients with inst@@ abil@@ ty ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ lever ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ized to obtain a G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or at the beginning of an@@ gi@@ ography ( at the time of Rand@@ om@@ ization ) or to the PCI .
in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , the characteristics of high risk agents , which required an@@ gi@@ ography within 72 hours , evenly spread over the 3 treatment arms .
about 77 % of patients had recur@@ ring Isch@@ ia , 70 % had dynamic EK@@ G@@ - changes or increased car@@ di@@ ary biom@@ ar@@ ker , 28 % had diabetes and about 99 % of patients were subjected to an@@ gi@@ ography within 72 hours .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used for the treatment of adults , adolescents and children from six years with diabetes that require treatment with ins@@ ulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the ab@@ dom@@ inal wall , inj@@ ected upper th@@ igh@@ s or upper arm as a continuous aquarium with a ins@@ ulin pump .
diabetes is a sick@@ ness in which the body is not enough ins@@ ulin to regul@@ ate the glucose levels ( sugar ) in the blood , or the ins@@ ulin can not work .
ins@@ ulin l@@ ul@@ ism distingu@@ ishes itself very slightly of human@@ ulin , and the change means that it acts faster and a shorter active time has a short @-@ effective human@@ ulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra was used in combination with a slower ins@@ ulin in patients with type 1 diabetes , where the body does not produce ins@@ ulin in two studies with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
in type 2 diabetes , in which the body ins@@ ulin is not effective , A@@ pi@@ dra was investigated in a study with 8@@ 78 adults .
the main inde@@ b@@ ator for the efficacy was the change of the substance of the substance gly@@ cem@@ ented hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that shows how well the blood sugar is set .
in the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes , a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7,@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) compared to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % at ins@@ ulin pro .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , lowering the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration of 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra , compared to 0.@@ 30 % in human normal @-@ ins@@ ulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra must not be used in patients who are possibly over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against ins@@ ulin l@@ ul@@ um or one of the other components , or in patients who have already been suffering from hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ k@@ emia .
the cans of A@@ pi@@ dra must be adapted , when it is administered along with a number of other medicines that can work on the blood of glu@@ es .
September 2004 , the European Commission issued San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ ent@@ is Deutschland GmbH granted approval for the market launch of A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra is either applicable as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the field of ab@@ dom@@ inal cloth , or sub@@ cut@@ aneous through continuous infusion in the area of ab@@ dom@@ inal cav@@ ity .
due to the reduced glucose capacity and di@@ min@@ ished ins@@ ulin changes , the ins@@ ulin needs can be reduced in patients with a limitation of liver function .
each change of the efficiency level , the brand ( Her@@ - St@@ eller ) , ins@@ ulin typical ( normal , N@@ PH , z@@ ink@@ del@@ ays etc . ) , the type of ins@@ ulin ( animal ins@@ ulin ) and / or the production method can draw a change of ins@@ ulin demand .
3 A in@@ sufficient dosage or termination of a treatment , in particular in patients with a ins@@ ulin @-@ charge diabetes , can lead to a hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia and a di@@ abet@@ ic k@@ eto@@ ac@@ idity ; these states are potentially li@@ fel@@ ong .
changing a patient to another ins@@ ulin type or ins@@ ulin one of another manufacturer should be made under str@@ ingent medical supervision and may require a change of dosage .
the time of testing of a hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ cem@@ ia depends on the active profile of the ins@@ ulin number and can therefore change during the switch of the treatment schem@@ atic .
to the substances that ampli@@ fy the bl@@ ending activity , increases the anti@@ di@@ abet@@ ic acid , an@@ gi@@ ot@@ ene enzyme , an@@ gi@@ ot@@ ene enzyme , an@@ gi@@ ot@@ enes , an@@ gi@@ ot@@ ene enzyme , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ yl@@ line , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ a , sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ ates and sul@@ fon@@ amid anti@@ biotics .
in addition , under the effect of sympath@@ ol@@ y@@ tics such as bedding , Cl@@ on@@ id@@ ine , Gu@@ an@@ eth@@ id@@ ine , and reserves the symptoms of ad@@ r@@ ener@@ able counter@@ weight is weak@@ ened or missing .
animal experimental studies for re@@ productive tox@@ icity showed no differences between In@@ su@@ c@@ ling@@ is@@ ul@@ ism and Human@@ ins@@ ulin in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , the birth or the post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .

severe hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ c@@ ics with consciousness can be given by an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Glu@@ k@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , which is given by an intraven@@ ous person , or by the intraven@@ ous gift of glucose by a doctor .
after a glucose injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the prim@@ itive cause for the heavy hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ cem@@ ia and to avoid similar episodes .
ins@@ ulin reduces blood sugar levels by stim@@ ulating the peripheral glucose intake ( in particular through sk@@ el@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature and fat ) as well as the in@@ hibition of glucose production in the liver .
