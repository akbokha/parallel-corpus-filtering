<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR), which is explained by the studies of humanist (CHMP) as the Committee of Humanities (CHMP).</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need more information about your disease or treatment, please read the packets (also part of the EPAR) or apply to your doctor or pharmacists.</seg>
<seg id="3">If you wish further information regarding the recommendations of CHMP, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, as 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg hot tabletten (tablets, which dissolves in the mouth) as a solution for insertion (1 mg / ml) and as injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. effective thinking and speaking, hallucinations (listening or vision of things that are not available), missal and desertions; • Bipolar-I disorder, a psychic disorder, alternating with periods (periods become abnormal).</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used for the treatment of severe episodes and to prevent manic episodes in patients who have applied to the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">Injection solution is used for fast control of increased unrest or behavioral disorders, if the oral consumption of the drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">Both diseases can be used to remove or the melting tablets in patients may have difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients receiving other medicines at the same time, the same as Abilify should be adapted to the dose of Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="10">This impairs the signal transmission between brain cells by "neurotransmitter," i.e. chemical substances which enable communication of nerve cells each.</seg>
<seg id="11">Arieprazole appears especially as "partial agonist" for the receptors for the neurotransmitter Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Ariipylbenzene like 5-Hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but in less dimensions as the neural ransitter works to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Da Dopamine and 5-Hydroxytryptamin with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, carries a role in normalize the activity of brain, which will reduce psychotic or manic symptoms and their reoccur.</seg>
<seg id="14">The effectiveness of Abilify, to prevent the symptoms of symptoms, was investigated in three studies over a year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of the injection solution was compared to 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases, compared to a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abilify was administered over twelve weeks of 347 patients with haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo which had been stabilized on 160 patients with which the manic symptoms were stabilized with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of Abilify Injection solution was compared to 301 patients with bipolar disorder, which suffered from Lorazepam (another antipsychotic) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies the change of symptoms of patients were investigated using a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who talked to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">In addition, the company also led studies to investigate how the body makes the hot tabletten and the solution to take up (decreases).</seg>
<seg id="20">In both studies with injection solution showed patients who received abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9,75 mg or 15 mg were significantly stronger unrest than the patient who received a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the application for the treatment of bipolar disorder reduced Abilify in four of five short-time studies and more effective than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify prevented for up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo in previously treated episodes with previously treated patients and when it was administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15-mg doses reduced also effective than placebo the symptoms increased, and were similar to Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common adverse events of Abilify (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disturbances (sovereignty), squad (sovereignty), salt water (sovereignty), salt water (increased memory production), tiredness (increased memory production), tiredness (sovereignty), tiredness (sovereignty), tiredness (soaking production), tiredness (sovereignty), tiredness (sovereignty), tiredness (sovereignty), tiredness (sovereignty), tiredness (sovereignty), tiredness (sovereignty), tiredness (soaking production), tiredness (sovereignty), tiredness (sovereignty), tiredness (sovereignty), tiredness (sovereignty), tiredness (sovereignty), tiredness (sovereignty), tiredness (soaking production), tiredness (sovereignty), tiredness (sovereignty), tiredness (sovereignty), tiredness (sovereignty), tiredness (sovereignty), tiredness (sovereignty), tiredness (soaking production), tiredness (sovereignty), tiredness (sovereignty), tiredness (sovereignty), tiredness (sovereignty), tiredness (sovereignty), tiredness (soaking production), tiredness (sovereignty), tiredness (sovereignty), tiredness (sovereignty), tiredness (sovereignty), tiredness (sovereignty), tiredness (sovereignty), tiredness (soaking production), tiredness (soaking production), tired</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee for Humanities (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and from moderately serious episodes in patients who were mainly manic episodes on the treatment with Ariipraole, compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the Committee came to the result that the benefits of injection solution in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes when an oral therapy is not suitable, compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission announced the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. a approval for the placing on the placing of Abilify in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">ABILIFY is for the treatment of a heavy episodes of the Bipolar-I- disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had predominantly manic episodes on the treatment with Ariipraole (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg / day with a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">An increased effectiveness in doses above a daily dose of 15 mg was not detected, although single patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg once a day, regardless of meals as Monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and Bipolar-I- disorder in patients ≥ 65 years was not detected.</seg>
<seg id="33">With respect to the greater sensitivity of this patient group, a lower initialdose should be considered to be considered if clinical factors are justify these factors (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 inductor is set out of combination therapy, the arithmeta dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of supreme behavior is reported to psychotic diseases and affectives and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after an antipsychotic treatment, also in treatment with Ariiprazol (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disturbance there was no increased Suicide risk with Ariipraole compared to other antipsychotica.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ariiprazol should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (mhydration disease, maltreatment disorders), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions for hypotonia predisponges (including acute drug) or hypertension (including acute and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 Spätdyscesia: clinical trials which lasted a year or less digested, there were occasional reports about during the treatment with Ariipraole guised Dyskinesis.</seg>
<seg id="39">If using an ABILIFY treated patients and symptoms of a late dyskinesis, should be taken into consideration, to reduce the dose or treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient has developed signs and symptoms that have a mns, or unclear a fever without any additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotics must be deposed, including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore Ariipolole should be used in patients with cramplifes in the anamity or in states that are used with cramplifes in connection with caution.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years old) with Ariiprazol in patients with psychoses are associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Ariipraole, an elevated risk of death in comparison to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, in one of these studies, a study of fixed dosage, a significant relationship between the dosage and the response to unwanted cerebrovascular events with Arias treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extremly and associated with ketoazide or hyperosmolarem Coma or death, was reported in patients who have been treated with atypical antipsychotic substances, including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no exact risk assessment for hyperglycemia-related adverse events with ABILIFY and other atypical antipsychotic substances treated patients who allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsy, polyphanty, polyphagie and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly in terms of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">A weight gain is generally known for healthy patients and in patients with bipolar Manie because of comorbidity, the application of antipsychotika, in which weight gain is observed, or an unhealthy lifestyle, and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effect of Ariipraole on the central nervous system, caution when Ariiprazol is used in combination with alcohol or other centrally centralized drugs such as sedation (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2-antagonist Famotidine, a gastric acid blocker reduces the resorption rate of arithmeta, but this effect is not relevant as clinically irrelevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy volunteers, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidin) increased by 107% while the Cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected to expect other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as flux in and paroxetin, similar effects and therefore, similar can be made can be made.</seg>
<seg id="52">CYP2D6 'bad' (= "Poor") Metabolism can result the common application with high-effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 compared to CYP2D6 extensive metastasis.</seg>
<seg id="53">If you consider the common gift of Ketoconazole or other high-effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY, the potential for potential risks of potential risks in patients.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV protein inhibitors, could be similar to similar effects and therefore, similar can be made can be made.</seg>
<seg id="55">After setting the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitors, the dose of ABILIFY should be increased to the Dosishlevel prior to the beginning of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram or CYP2D6 together with ABILIFY can be administered jointly with ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical studies showed doses of 10-30 mg arithmetrobenzene per day no significant effect on metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (Warfarin), 2C19 (Warfarlezol) and 3A4 (dextromethorphan).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be used to notify their doctor if pregnant or pregnant or pregnancy during the treatment with Ariipraole.</seg>
<seg id="59">Due to the inadequate data situation in humans and due to the reproductive studies in pregnancy, this medication may not be applied in the pregnancy, unless the benefits justifies the potential risk for the Fötus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, with other antipsychotica, patients should be warned against hazardous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are sure that Ariipraole has no negative influence on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following adverse events were more common (≥ 1 / 100) as under placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of the side effects listed below is defined in accordance with the following criteria: frequently (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study of 52 weeks in patients who were treated with Ariipraole, a total lower incidence of incidence (25.8%) of EPS including Parkinsonism, Akathisie, Dystonie and Dyskinsistence, compared to patients suffering from Haloperidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% in patients under Ariipraole treatment and 13,1% in patients were placebo.</seg>

<seg id="69">A comparison between patient groups under Ariipraole and placebo in which potentially clinically significant changes of the routinely controlled laboratory parameters found no medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Increase of the CPK (creatine phosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of the patients treated with Arias treated patients compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">To the side effects, which can occur in connection with an antipsychotic syndrome, narrowed neuroleptish syndrome, Spätdyskinesis, and elevated mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">Clinical studies and since the market launch were unintended or clear acute overdosizees with adult patients suffering from estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although there are no information about the effectiveness of a hemoglysis in the treatment of an overdoalysis treatment; it is unlikely that Hemodialysis in the treatment of a sureation of benefits, as Ariipraole has a high plasma monitoring.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the effectiveness of Ariipraids in schizophrenia and Bipolar-I disorder on Dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1a- receptors and a antagonistic effect on serotonine 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">Arieprazole showed a high affinity to Dopamine D2- and D3-receptor and a moderate affinity to Dopamine D4-, to the serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, for alpha-1-adrity and to the histamine-H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">In the gift of Ariipolole in doses of 0.5 to 30 mg once a day over 2 weeks of healthy volunteers showed a dosisoning reduction of 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor-Ligure, at the Nucleus caudatus and the turret.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-time studies (4 to 6 weeks) patients with positive or negative symptoms showed a statistically significant improvement in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="78">In one half-controlled study, 52% of the response of the response of patients who used a response to study medication were similar in both groups (Ariipraole 77% and haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values from Messrals, which were defined as secondary study potential, including PANSS and Montgomery-Asberg- Depressions scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement in Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study about 26 weeks in stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia showed a significantly higher reduction in response rate that was 34% in the arithmeta group and 57% below placebo was placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In a Olanzapin-controlled, multinational double-blind study at Schizophrenia (N = 18 or 13% of balanced patients) significantly reduced weight gain of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of approx. 5.6 kg).</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with a flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar-I disturbae showed an increase in placebo over 3 weeks to reduce manic symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled Monotherapy study about 3 weeks with a fixed dosage of patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar-I disturbances showed no superior effectiveness compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two Placemento- and active-controlled monotherapeutical studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a Bipolar-I interference, with or without psychotic features, Ariiprazol showed an increase in placebo 3 and an effect effect that was comparable to lithium or Haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">In addition, Ariiprazol also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of the Mania like lithium or Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study about 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a Bipolar-I intermittance, with or without psychotic features, the accompanying therapy with Ariiprazol revealed an overlegenic effectiveness in reducing manic symptoms compared to Monotherapy with lithium or Valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a long-term expansion phase over 74 weeks in manic patients who had reached a remission phase during a stabilisation phase prior to Randomization, as opposed to placebo in the prevention of a bipolar return, predominantly in the prevention of a return in the Manie.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on vitro-studies the CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes responsible for the expansion and hydroxyylbenzene, the N-deadline is catalyzes by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean elimination of elimination period lies at nearly 75 hours for Ariipraids in extensive metabolites via CYP2D6 and at nearly 146 hours at 'bad' (= "Poor") Metabolisans via CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Arieprazole, there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy volunteers, and did not show no gender effects during a pharmacokinetic investigation.</seg>

<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetical properties of Ariipraole and Dehydro-Ariipolole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure in comparison to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study in subjects with different grave liver cirrhosis (Child-Puga class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the impairment of liver function on pharmacokinetics of the liver function on pharmacokinetetics of class C, which is not enough to drag to the metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional clinical studies for safety-harmacology, toxicity in recurrative gift, reproductive toxicity, Genotoxicity and to canvant potential had made no special hazards to the human beings.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only with doses or expositions that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans, so they have only limited or no significance for clinical use.</seg>

<seg id="363">Injection can also be made from the patient or their carnursor, if they receive a reasonable guide.</seg>
<seg id="364">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency or in patients receiving chemotherapy should always be in recommended range (between 10 and 12 grams per deciliter with adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The iron values of all patients are to control the treatment to ensure that there is no iron deficiency, and iron supplements should be administered during the entire treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients who received chemotherapy or chemotherapy in patients with kidney problems, anaemia can be caused by a erythropoietinmangel or therefore that the body is not sufficient for the body's own erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoietin is also applied to operations in order to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reducing the consequences of blood loss.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell that was introduced to a gene (DNA) which it has been added to the formation of epochetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="369">Abseamed was compared to the administration as injection in a main study with 479 patients suffering from kidney problems caused by renal problems caused by reference to reference problems.</seg>
<seg id="370">At least eight weeks of patients receiving Eprex / Erypo were injected into a vein before they have either been reamed or continued Eprex / Erypo.</seg>

<seg id="387">An increase in hemogglobins by more than 2 g / dl (1,25 mmol / l) should be avoided over a period of four weeks.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to the variability between patients, individual hemicglobinds can be observed or under the hemline-target concentration.</seg>
<seg id="389">In view of this hemline variability, the hemoglobin target concentrations should be tried by 10 g / dl (6,2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the hemline-value is increasing by more than 2 g / dl (1,25 mmol / l) per month, or if the permanent hemmoglobinding rate is 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l), the epic-alfa dose is reduced by 25%.</seg>

<seg id="749">Summary of the EPAR to the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR), in which is explained as the Committee for Humanities (CHMP), in order to analyze recommendations concerning the application of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="750">Accounts is used for treatment of type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin dependent diabetes), where metformin (a diabetic medication) can not be applied. • It can be used together with another diabetic medicine (dualtherapy).</seg>
<seg id="751">In addition to metformin in patients (in particular, overweight patients) can not be applied with metformin alone in the highest possible dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulfur lining or insulin, the previous dose of Sulfonyl treatment or insulin can be retained, except for patients with hypoglytic leukaemia (low blood sugar); this should be reduced to the dose of Sulfonylresin and insulin.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's own insulin is better utilized and the blood sugar levels sinks, which means that type 2 diabetes can be better.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of Actos in Tripletherapy was investigated; patients received a combination of metformin with a sulfonharnatives, in addition, they received either Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies, the concentration of a substance was measured in blood (glycerylized hemoglobin, HbA1c), which shows how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos lead to a lowering of the HbA1c-value, which relate that blood sugar levels were reduced from 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the Tripleal therapy, the effect of an additional gift of Actos in the existing treatment with metformin and a sulphide resin in a reduction in HbA1c values by 0,94%, while the additional gift of placebo led to a decrease of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study, in which the combination of Actos and insulin had investigated in 289 patients, investigating the Actos in addition to insulin, a decrease of HbA1c values by 0,69% after 6 months, compared to placebo in addition to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common adverse events related to Actos were tendencies, infections of the upper respiratory infections, weight gain and hypothesia (reduce sensitivity to friction).</seg>
<seg id="760">Accounts may neither be used in patients who are possibly supersensitive (allergic) compared to Pioglitazone or one of the other components, even in patients with liver problems, cardiac insufficiency or diabetic ketoacidjan (high level of Ketonspiegel - acidity-level).</seg>
<seg id="761">It was decided that Actos in part of a monotherapy (in sole use) as an alternative to standard treatment with metformin in patients may not be displayed in which metformin is not displayed.</seg>
<seg id="762">In October 2000, the European Commission announced the European Commission of Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited for placing on the market of Actos in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">The tablets are white till white, round, curved and carry on one side the marking "15" and on the other side the inscription "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazone is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, with insulin inadequate and incompatibility with which metformin due to contraindications or incompatibility (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">For the application of Pioglitazone in patients under 18 years of age, no data is available, therefore the application in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients suffering from the presence of at least one risk factor (e.g. previous heart attack or symptomatic coronary heart disease), the physician should start the treatment with the lowest available dose and increase dosage.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of cardiac insufficiency, weight gain or estrogen, especially those with reduced cardial reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of cardiac failure, weight gain and oil when Pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular outcomes trial with Pioglitazone in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and the existing advanced makrovasthma disease was carried out.</seg>
<seg id="770">In this study an increase in reports about cardiac failure, which resulted in an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased output liver enzymes (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of standard range) or with other signs of liver disease. Pioglitazone cannot be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT mirror up to 3 times the upper limit of the standardization are increased, the liver enzymatic values are as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If one patient has developed symptoms, such as such an acute nausea, vomiting, surface damage, fatigue, appetite and / or darker harn, are the liver enzymatic values.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision whether the treatment of patients with pioglitazone continued, should be redirected to the evaluation parameters of clinical evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical studies with Pioglitazone has been demonstrated a dosisance weight gain, which can be stir from fat deposits and in some cases linked to a liquid degree.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of a Häoglitazone, a marginally reduction in the middle hemicglobins (relative reduction by 4%) and the hematrits (relative reduction by 4.1%).</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in patients with Pioglitazone in patients under metformin (relative reduction of hemogglobins by 3-4% and hematology (relative reduction in hemogglobins by 1-2% and hematocrits by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin-insitivity in patients who received Pioglitazone as oral two or triple combination therapy with insulin-based chemotherapy with insulin, the risk of dossizing hypoglykemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the market launch, under the treatment with Thiazolidindian, including Pioglitazone, about an occurrence or deterioration of a diabetic macular modems with a reduction of visual acuity.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there is a direct connection between taking Pioglitazone and the occurrence of maculaödemen, but if patients report on disruptions of the visual acuity; a suitable ophthalmological Enlightenment should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summarizing analysis of messages from randomized, randomised controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with Pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated Fraktur incidence amounted to 1.9 Fratures per 100 patient years with Pioglitazone treated women and 1.1 fractures for women who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the proactive study, a study conducted over 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events that were treated with Pioglitazone treated patients compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fragment per 100 patients) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="784">The patients shouldn't be aware of a pregnancy, and if a patient does a pregnancy wishes or those who enter, is the treatment (see section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies on investigation of interactions have shown that Pioglitazone has no relevant effects on pharmacokinetetics or pharmaceutical dynamics of Digoxin, Warfarin, phenyloumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interaction with pharmaceuticals, which are metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. oral contrativa, Cyclosporin, calciumcanalblocker and HMGCoA reducer are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a Cytochrome P450 2C8- Inhibitor) resulted in an increase in AUC by Pioglitazone by the 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazone with Rifampicin (a Cytochrome P450 2C8-inductor) resulted in a decrease of AUC by Pioglitazone by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to due to the treatment with Pioglitazone which reduces hyperinsulinemia in pregnancy and increased insulin resistance to the parent substrates and thereby reducing the availability of metabolic substrates.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very frequent &gt; 1 / 10; commonly &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 1000; rarely &gt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, single cases: unknown (from this data is not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="791">This lead to a temporary change of the tower and the refractive component of the lens, as also observed in other hypoglycemic substances.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical studies with Pioglitazone came to placebo over the three times the upper limit of the standard range. however, more rarely than in comparative groups under metformin or sulfonresin.</seg>
<seg id="793">In a outcomes study in patients with existing advanced makrovascular disease was the frequency of severe cardiac failure under Pioglitazone by 1.6% higher than in placebo when Pioglitazone bzw.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the market launch, it has been reported about cardiac insufficiency under Pioglitazone, however, if Pioglitazone has been used in combination with insulin or in patients with cardiac insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="795">There was a summarizing analysis of messages from randomised controlled trials, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with Pioglitazone treated groups and over 7,400 patients treated with comparative medication treated.</seg>
<seg id="796">In the over a period of 3.5 years of running proactive study, Fratures were treated at 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with Pioglitazone treated patients compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="797">During taking the maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, 180 mg / day over seven days there came no symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazone seems to work on a activation of specific bueptors (Peroxisome Proliferation of Recepor g (PPAR-γ)), which leads to an elevated insulin-sensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal muscular cells.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitazone reduces glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral Glucosine ranking in case of insulin-resistant.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with Pioglitazone versus Gliclazid as Monotherapy was conducted over two years to investigate the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 treatment months).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years after the beginning of therapy a blood sugar control was determined (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) by Pioglitazone at 69% of the treated patients (compared to 50% of patients treated below gliclazid).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled study about 12 months, patients whose blood sugar were randomized with insulin-insulin to placebo was randomized to Pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under Pioglitazone reduced the average HbA1c - value by 0,45%, compared to the patients who continued to do insulin, a reduction of insulin assortation in the group treated with Pioglitazone group.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical studies over a year, under Pioglitazone showed a statistically significant decrease of the album in / Kreatinin-Quotiations compared to initial values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of Pioglitazone (Monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was tested in a small, on 18 weeks of investigating type 2 diabetic patients.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical trials, compared to placebo a reduction in plasma triglycemeride and the free fatty acids and a rise of HDL- cholesterol levels as well as slightly higher, but clinically not significantly increased LDL- cholesterol levels observed.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical studies over a period of up to two years, Pioglitazone reduced compared to placebo, metformin or Gliclazid the overall plasynglycemeride and the free fatty acids and increased the HDL cholesterol levels.</seg>
<seg id="808">Compared to placebo was found no statistically significant increase in LDL Cholesterinspiegel, while under metformin and licenzid decrease values were observed.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study about 20 weeks, Pioglitazone was not only the sober triglyceride, but also improved triglyceride mirror, this also improved triglyceride absorption, which can be used for both effect on the Triglyceride Absorption and the Triglyceride synthesis as well.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the proactive study, a cardiovascular outcomes study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and preexisting advanced macular disease in groups were randomized to have received either Pioglitazone or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral application, Pioglitazone is quickly resorated, with the peak concentration on unchangeable Pioglitazone in plasma was usually reached 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">Based on this basis, the contribution of M-IV is equivalent to the efficacy of Pioglitazone, while resistant to the relative effectiveness of M-II minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In interventions studies that Pioglitazone could have no relevant effect on pharmacokinetetics or pharmaceutical dynamics of Digoxin, Warfarin, phenyloumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a Cytochrome P450 2C8-inhibitor) increases or reduces plasma concentration of Pioglitazone (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">According to oral application of radioactive pioglitazone in humans the marker was found mainly in barrel (55%) and at a lower degree in Harn (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The mean plasma-Eliminationic life of unchangeable Pioglitazone is 5-6 hours, and that of the active metabolism is at 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasma concentrations of Pioglitazone and its metabolites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function lower than in healthy volunteers, but the rates of oral clearing of the maternity is similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies performed with mice, rats, dogs and monkey, after repeated administration of plasma volume with hemogniversaries, anemia and reversible ceccentric heart hypertrophic.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to be attributable to Pioglitazone in the gestation of hyperinsulinemia and increased insulin resistance of the parent's disease and reduces the availability of metabolic substrates for fognial growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years), intraocular concentrations of hyperplasia (male and female rats) were induced and tumours (male rats) of the urinary bladder epithelium.</seg>
<seg id="821">In a animal model of the familyomatous polyposis (FAP), the treatment with two other Thiazolidindices resulted in an increased frequency of colontumors.</seg>
<seg id="822">The tablets are white to whitish, round, flat and wear on one side the marking "30" and on the other side the inscription "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="823">The calculated Fraktur incidence amounted to 1.9 Fratures per 100 patient years with Pioglitazone treated women and 1.1 fractures for women who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the proactive study, a study conducted over 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events that were treated with Pioglitazone treated patients compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fragment per 100 patients) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study more than two years the effects of a combination therapy was investigated using Pioglitazone or Gliclazid.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical trials over 1 year, under Pioglitazone showed a statistically significant decrease of the album in / Kreatinin-Quotiations compared to initial values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study about 20 weeks, Pioglitazone was not only the sober triglyceride, but improved in addition the postpranch increased triglyceride mirror, which both have a effect on the tryglyzerid absorption than even on the heyginaleride synthesis as well.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study was missing on their primary endpoint, which was a combination of the overall mortality, non-fatal myokardal syndrome, leg amputation above the ankling, coronarer Revascularisation and Revascularisation, the results close to that with the intake of Pioglitazone cannot be associated with the intake of Pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="829">The tablets are white to whitish, round, flat and wear on one side the marking "45" and on the other side the inscription "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="830">In a summary analysis of messages from randomized, randomised controlled, double-blind clinical trials were treated over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,400 patients who received comparative medication, showed an increased incidence of bones with women.</seg>
<seg id="831">In the proactive study, a study conducted over 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events that were treated with Pioglitazone treated patients compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fragment per 100 patients) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="832">In a study about 20 weeks, Pioglitazone was not only the sober triglyceride, but improved in addition the postpranch increased triglyceride mirror, which both have a effect on the Triglyceride Absorption and on the headers in Triglyceride synthesis as well.</seg>

<seg id="864">Actraphane was given a total of 294 patients with type 1 diabetes, where the pancreas is no insulin, and type 2 diabetes, where the body is not able to use insulin-effective.</seg>
<seg id="865">In the study, the concentration of a substance (glycerylized hemoglobin (HbA1c) was measured, which shows how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="866">Actraphane resulted in a decrease of the HbA1c mirror which indicates that the blood sugar levels were similar to be reduced significantly as with another human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="867">Actraphane should not be used in patients who are possibly supersensitive (allergic) to humaninsulin (rDNA) or other components.</seg>
<seg id="868">In addition, doses of Actraphane may have to be adjusted, when it is administered along with a number of other medicines that can be effected on blood sugar (the full list is to remove the packets).</seg>
<seg id="869">At the end, the Committee of Humanities (CHMP) came to the conclusion that the benefits of actraphane was in the treatment of diabetes from the risks of diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="870">October 2002, the European Commission announced the European Commission Novo Nordisk A / S for placing on the market of Actraphane in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="871">Pre-mixed insulin products normally be applied once or twice daily, when a fast-initial effect is used together with a longer lasting effect.</seg>
<seg id="872">The injection needle must be kept at least 6 seconds under the skin to ensure that the entire dose is injected.</seg>
<seg id="873">Patients whose blood glucose levels significantly improved by an intensive insulin-therapy, the hypoglycemia warning symptom can perceive and should be advised.</seg>
<seg id="874">Any amendment to strength, brand (manufacturer), insulin type (fast work, bi@-@ phase), type of insulin (animal insulin, human insulin or insulin-dependent) and / or manufacturing method (due to recombinant DNA against insulin of animal origin) can lead that a change of dosage is required.</seg>
<seg id="875">If the change is required to actraphane in the patient, it can be necessary for the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the conversion.</seg>
<seg id="876">Some patients who were hypoglycemic reactions after a change of animal against human insulin, reported that the early warning symptom of a hypoglycemia were less pronounced or unlike its previous insulin.</seg>
<seg id="877">Before travelling, which should go over several time zones, the patient should bring it to the advice of his physician, as such journeys can be used, insulin and meals must be applied to other times respectively.</seg>
<seg id="878">The doctor must therefore consider the possible interactions of therapy and patients always ask for others to others by them.</seg>
<seg id="879">4. hypoglykemia as well as hyperglycemia, which can occur with a non-controlled diabetic therapy, increasing the risk of abnormalities and fruit tod in utero.</seg>
<seg id="880">Severe hypoglycics can lead to consciousness and / or cramplifes and caused by temporary or permanent disruptions of brain function and even death.</seg>
<seg id="881">Disorders of the nervous system Gelegder - periority neuropathy a rash of blood sugar control can be associated with complaints that are called acute painful neuropathy and usually reversible neuropathy.</seg>
<seg id="882">5 A intensification of insulin therapy with a rupture improvement of blood sugar levels can be connected with a temporary deterioration of diabetic retinopathy.</seg>
<seg id="883">Disorders of skin and sub-hauling woven - Lipodystrophy on the injection point, a Lipodystrophy may occur when missed the injection plant within the injection area.</seg>
<seg id="884">General disorders and complaints at the administration site - Local oversensitive reaction to injection molding (tube, swelling, juckily, pain and hematoma on the injection point).</seg>
<seg id="885">Disorders of the immune system scholar - Urtiaria, Exanthem Very rare - anaphylactic reactions symptoms of generated overweight, itrust, gastrointestinal disturbances, angioneurial oil, breathing difficulties, palpitations, low blood pressure and powerlessness.</seg>
<seg id="886">However, a hypoglytic leukaemia can be implemented in stages: • Easily hypoglyctures can be treated with glucose or sugar foods.</seg>
<seg id="887">Diabetics should therefore always have grief, sweetness, biscuits or sugar fruit juice with a intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of Glucagon (0.5 to 1.0 mg) by a proven aid or caused by glucose by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="888">The effect starts within half an hour, the maximum working maximum will be reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total amount of activity is up to 24 hours.</seg>
<seg id="889">Resorption The Resorption profile is established in it that it is a mixture of insulin products with faster or delayed resorption.</seg>
<seg id="890">A series of spades (hydrolyse-) places on human insulin molecule were moved into consideration; none of the metabolites produced in the split.</seg>
<seg id="891">Based on conventional clinical studies for safety-harmacology, toxicity in recurrent gift, Genotoxicity, to carcinogenic potential and reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data can recognize no special hazards for human beings.</seg>
<seg id="892">It is recommended - after the Actraphane piercing bottle from the refrigerator - the temperature of insulin at room temperature (does not exceed 25 ° C) before it is compensated for the first use.</seg>
<seg id="893">Some patients who were hypoglycemic reactions after a change of animal against human insulin, reported that the early warning symptom of a hypoglycemia were less pronounced or unlike its previous insulin.</seg>
<seg id="894">The doctor must therefore consider the possible interactions of therapy and patients always ask for others to others by them.</seg>
<seg id="895">12 Notwithstanding the hypoglycemia as well as hyperglycemia, which can occur with a non-controlled diabetic therapy, increasing the risk of abnormalities and fruit tod in utero.</seg>
<seg id="896">13 A intensification of insulin therapy with a rupture improvement of blood sugar levels can be connected with a temporary deterioration of diabetic retinopathy.</seg>
<seg id="897">The terminal half-life period (t ½) is therefore rather a measure of Resorption as a measure of elimination per se of insulin to plasma (insulin to one ½ of only few minutes).</seg>

<seg id="1532">Patients with hemophilia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency, causing blood clauses such as bleeding in joints, muscles or inner organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma but made in a method designed as "recombinant DNA technology":</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell that was introduced to a gene (DNA) which it was authorized to formation of the human clutch factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Advate is similar to another in the European Union of Recombinates, similar to that the medicine contains no proteins of human or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies of patients with severe to moderate hemophilia A, among them a study with 53 children under six years, the application of the drug was investigated for the prevention of bleeding and surgical surgery.</seg>
<seg id="1537">In the main study, the efficacy of Cate was awarded with "excellent" or "good" in the prevention of blood disorders in 86% of 510.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common adverse events of Advate (observes 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are dizziness, headache, pyrexie (fever) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII.</seg>

<seg id="1647">The company recorded data from a study with a patient, at Li-Fraumeni-Cancer, in the field of construction, in bones and brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP's answers to the company had examined the questions, still some issues were unexplained.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the evaluation of the initially submitted documents the CHMP has been generated on Day 120 a list of questions which will be sent to the company.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to the CHMP opinion, the injection of Advexin in Li-Fraumeni tumours brings advantages to the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The Committee also had concerns relating to the processing of the medicine in the body, the type of administration as well as the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1652">In addition, the company was not sufficient that Advantin can be manufactured in a reliable way, and that neither the environment nor for people who come in contact with the patient, is harmful.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company put the CHMP not to be aware of whether the withdrawal consequences for patients who are currently involved in clinical trials or "compassionate use" programs with Advexin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"changing the material release" means that the tablets are so composed that one of the effective components are immediately released, and the other slowly over a few hours will be released.</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used to treat the symptoms of seasonal rhinitis (hay penalties, through a allergy against pollen pathway of nasal paths) in patients with nasal muzzle (cloths nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and adolescents ages 12, the recommended dose of Aerinaze is twice daily a tablet that should be taken with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be so short as possible, as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucosa (stopped nose).</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be found on the constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The most effective measures were the changes in the severity of the Heuvee ympanome that were reported from the patient before the treatment and during 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, patients showed their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and evaluated the symptoms related to the symptoms in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In consideration of all Heuvectors of the nose reported patients, the aerinaze had reported about a decrease of symptoms by 46.0%, compared to 35.9% with the patient, the pseudoephedrine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">When only the swelling of nasal mucosa was regarded, the patients showed up 37.4% compared with aerinaze compared to 26.7% for the patient who Desloratadine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of Aerinaze (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients), speedycaress (appetite), oral malfunction, headache, fatigue, Insomnie (insomnia), mannolence (insomnia), mannolence (insomnia), insomnia and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerinaze may not be overweight (allergic) against Desloratadin, pseudoephedrine or one of the other components, against adverge active substances or Loratadin (a different medicines for the treatment of allergies).</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerinaze cannot be used in patients with hypertension (increased eye pressure), cardiovascular disease (overfunction of thyroid), hyperthyreosis (overfunction of the thyroid), or have already caused an hemorrhagic stroke (caused by a brain injury) or a risk for an hemorrhagic stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission announced a approval for the market launch of Aerinaze in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, however, is in the whole of the whole (i.e. without it to crashes, break or chewing).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aerinaze should not be used in children under 12 years due to the lack of data concerning the failure and effectiveness (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is so short as possible, and should not be continued after deformation of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days, as long as long application the activity of pseudoephedrine can take away.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After decline of swelling mucous membranes in the upper respiratory cause, treatment with desloratine can be continued as Monotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Since Aerinaze Pseudoephedrine, the medicine is also contraded with patients who are treated with a monoaminase (MAO) inhibitor and within 2 weeks after completion of such treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to the alphanimetric activity with other vasoconstrikers such as Bromocripitin, Pergoid, Dihydroergotamine or other decongestiva, phenylpropanzek, phenylephrine, ephedrine, ephedrine, Oxymetazolin, Napholin, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and effectiveness of these combination therapy were not tested and the data are not sufficient to express appropriate recommendations to the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The safety and efficacy of aerinaze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver function wasn't checked and the data are not sufficient to express appropriate recommendations to the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients must be informed that treatment for occurrence of hypertension or tachycaresses, heart rhythmids, nausea or any other neurological symptoms (like headaches or an amplification of headaches) must be deposited.</seg>
<seg id="1677">In the treatment of the following patient groups, patients with hypertension • patients with hypertension • patients with hypertension • patients with hypertension • patients with a myocardial infarction in anamity, diabetes mellitus, bladder or bronchds in the Anamity.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze is required at least 48 hours prior to the implementation of matological tests, because antihistamine otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions or in their magnitude.</seg>

<seg id="1681">It is not yet identified for metabolism of desloratadine enzymes that interactions with other medicines are not entirely excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadine inhibits in-vivo CYP3A4 and in-vitro studies have shown that the medicine CYP2D6 is not inhibited and neither a substrate is a inhibitor of the P-glycoprotein.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The dissolution of the use of aerinaze during pregnancy is not secured, experiences of a large number of affected pregnancies, however there is no increase in frequency of abnormalities compared to the frequency of the normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since reproductive studies on animals are not always transferred to humans and not used due to vasoconstriving properties of pseudoephedrin should not be applied in the pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, patients should be clarified that in very rare cases, in very rare cases, can lead to a impairment of transport or ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="1686">Symptoms may vary between a CNS depression (coding, Apnoe, reduced mental attention, cyanosis, Koma, heart-cycle collapse) and a ZNS stimulation (insomnia, hallucinations, Tremor, Konvulsions) with possible lettering.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headache, anxiety, irritation, muscle weakness, lyric cardiac disease, lyric cardiac disease, thirst, transcarial pain, wings, tinnitus, tendency and hypertension or hypotonia.</seg>
<seg id="1688">A ZNS stimulation is especially likely to taste such as atropine-typical symptoms (mouth dry, poupillenrigid and - dilatation, hood, hyperthermia and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include both the inhibiting of proinflammatory cytokinen such as IL-4, IL-8, IL-8 and IL-13, as well as the inhibitor of the expression of the adhesion of the Adversioner P-seless on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">In a single dose study with adults, Desloratadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement sizes of the flight power, including the reinforcement subjective and the tasks that are connected to the flies.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical studies, the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily has no increased frequency of drowsiness compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The orange application of Pseudoephedrine in the recommended dosage can cause additional sympathetic effects, such as an increase in blood pressure, a tachycaring or manifestations of a ZNS Erreg.</seg>
<seg id="1693">1,248 patients took part in the age between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergy rhinitis, 414 patients received Aerinaze tablets.</seg>

<seg id="1696">The effectiveness of Aerinaze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender, age or ethnic origin.</seg>
<seg id="1697">As part of a single dose study for pharmacokinetics of Aerinaze, Desloratine is detectable within 30 minutes after administration in plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the perseverity application of aerinaze with healthy volunteers more than 14 days the flow-weight of Desloratadin, 3-Hydroxydesloratadin and pseudoephedrine was reached on Day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">In the framework of a pharmacokinetic multi-dossier, which was carried out with the formulation as tablet of healthy adult subjects, was determined that four subjects of Desloratadin badly damaged.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A components interact study shows that the exposition (Cmax and AUC) of pseudoephedrin following the sole gift of pseudoephedrine is organic equivalent to the exposition to the gift of a Aerinaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on conventional clinical studies for safety-harmacology, toxicity in recurrying gift, for the toxicity and reproductive toxicity with desloratine however no special hazards for human beings are recognizable.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination had no greater toxicity as their individual components, and the observed effects were generally consistent with the ingredient Pseudoephedrin.</seg>

<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be used to protect against influenza, which is caused by the tribe of influenza, which is caused by the tribe (type) H5N1 of influenza A-virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special type of vaccine that could cause before a trunk of influenza, which may cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">An influenza pandemic breaks out if a new trunk of influenza could easily distribute human being, because humans have no immunity (no protection).</seg>
<seg id="1897">After administration of the vaccine, the immune system detects the parts of the Grippevirus as "body foreign" and forms antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="1898">This is the immune system later in the position to form a contact with a flu virus of this stem.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Afterwards, the membrane cover of the virus with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membranes that detects the human body as a physical foreign body) and used as part of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">A inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not conducted in accordance with the "Good Clinical Practice" (GCP).</seg>

<seg id="1905">For patients who cannot swallow the capsules, Agenase is available as a solution to insert, but these cannot be taken together with Ritonavir, because the safety of this combination was not examined.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Agenase should only be instituted when the physician has tested the antiviral medicines of the patient previously taken, and the probability is judged that the virus may be entrusted to the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily, with twice daily 100 mg of ritonavir and with other antiviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1908">For children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of Agenase is aimed at body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">Agenase reduces HIV-quantity in blood in combination with other antiviral medicines in the blood and keeps them at a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">AIDS is not able to heal AIDS, however, it may have the peeling of the immune system and thus far from the development of AIDS-related infections and diseases.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Agenase has been studied in combination with other antiviral medicines, however, in two main studies with 736 HIV-infected adults who did not have been treated with prototyping.</seg>
<seg id="1912">This with low dosiavir reinforced medicine Agenase was compared with 206 adults who had previously taken earlier protectors, with other proteins.</seg>
<seg id="1913">Principal indebator for the efficacy was the proportion of patients with non-detectable concentrations of HIV in blood (Viruslast) or the change of viruslast after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the studies with patients who had previously taken no prototyped, however, after 48 weeks, more patients had a virusload under 400 copies / ml than under placebo but Agenase were less effective than indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, Agenase has also reduced the virusload, but with the children who had been treated earlier with prototyped, only very few on the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study with adults who had been treated earlier with prototyped numbers, sened with Ritonavir enhanced medicines Agenase amplified viruslast after 16 weeks of treatment as effective as other proteins.</seg>
<seg id="1917">In patients with HIV, which was resistant to four other proteins, it came under Ageneavir with Ritonavir to a stronger waste of viruslast after four weeks than in the patient who continued their previous release.</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common adverse events of Agenase (observes more than 1 of 10 patients) are headache, diarrhoea (diarrhea), Nausea (nausea), vomiting, rash and Fatigue (fatigue).</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Agenase may not be used in patients who are possibly supersensitive (allergic) against Ambavir or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Agenase may not be used in patients, the currant herb (a vegetable preparation for treating depression) or pharmaceuticals, which are equally suited as Agenase, and in high concentrations in the blood of health harmful.</seg>

<seg id="1922">At the end, the Committee of Humanities (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Agenase in combination with other antiretroviral medicines for treating HIV-1-infected adults and children aged over four years compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Agenase is usually taken together with the pharmacokinetetic amplifier Ritonavir, but the committee presented that the benefits of Agenase in combination with Ritonavir in patients who previously not have not been detected.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"" "Agenase was originally approved in" extraordinary circumstances, "" "" since the time of approval from scientific reasons only limited information template. "" "</seg>
<seg id="1925">In October 2000, the European Commission issued a approval for the company Glaxo Group Limited for placing on the market of Agenase in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Genase is in combination with other antiretroviral medicines for treating HIV-1- infected, inhibitor (PI) pre-treated adults and children from 4 years onwards.</seg>
<seg id="1927">For usually, Agenase capsules should be administered to pharmacokinetetic booster set by Ambavir along with low doses of ritonavir (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of Ambavir should be carried out in consideration of the individual viral resistance pattern and treatment of patients (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of ambavir as a solution to take up 14% less than a capsule; therefore Agenase capsules and solution can not be interchangeable on a milligram per milligram basis (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Agenase capsules amounts to 600 mg of amboavir twice daily along with 100 mg ritonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If Agenase capsules be applied without the amplification of Ritonavir (Booger), higher doses are applied to Agenase (1200 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Agenase capsules amounts to 20 mg Ambavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg Ambavir which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">Pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of Agenase in combination with low doses of ritonavir or other proteins were not examined with children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Genase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years, due to the absence of data to unthinkable and effectiveness (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on pharmacokinetetic data the dose to Agenase capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function at 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">Concurrent use should be performed in patients with mild or regular liver function with caution, in patients with severe liver function it is counterindexed (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">The genase can not be given simultaneously with drugs which have a low therapeutic width and also substrates the substrates of the cytochrome P450-Isooner ms 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Herbal preparations (hypericum perforation) included, may not be applied due to the risk reduction in plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of ambavir during taking ambavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be pointed out that Agenase or any other antiretroviral therapy do not lead to cure the HIV infection and that they may also develop opportunistic infections or other complications of a HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The current antiretroviral therapy including the treatment with Agenase prevents the risk of transfer from HIV to other sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">For usually Agenase capsules are to be applied along with low doses of ritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral medicines (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients receiving chronic hepatitis B or C suffer from chronic hepatitis B and with an antiretroviral combination therapy, have increased risk of heavy liver preparations with potentially fatal course.</seg>

<seg id="1944">Patients with existing reduced liver function including a chronic active hepatitis indicate an increased frequency of liver function under an antiretroviral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">The simultaneous application of Agenase and Ritonavir with fluorticason or other Glukokortic is not recommended unless the possible use of systemic korosteroider effects including Morbus Cushing and Suppression of the secondary function (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">Since the incineration of the HMG CoA reductase inhibitor and Simvastatin is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, a simultaneous administration of myopathies, including Rhabdomyolysen, is not recommended.</seg>

<seg id="1948">In patients who take the medicine at the same time, Agenase can be effective because of reduced plasma cutting of ambavir less effective (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with Ambavir, the effectiveness of hormonal contrativa can be altered, but the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">If methadon is given to ambobr at the same time, the patient should therefore be monitored on opolientosis symptom, in particular if they are still very low doses of ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Due to the possible risk of toxicity of a toxicity in the Agenase solution, this formulation is traded with children under an age of four years and should be used with caution during certain other patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Genase should be placed on duration 5 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms are accompanied or the mucous membranes are involved (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">In patients who received an antiretroviral therapy including protein inhibitor, was reported about the occurrence of diabetes mellitus, Hyperglykemia or an exacal type of diabetes mellitus.</seg>

<seg id="1975">If this medication should be used simultaneously, there is be careful because Delavirdin is less effective because of the reduction and possibly subtherapeutic plasma cutting might be effective.</seg>
<seg id="1976">When these medicines will be applied together, caution is required; a thorough clinical and virological surveillance should be done, as an accurate forecast of combination of ambavir and Ritonavir to Delavirdin is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous gift of Ambavir and Riolutin led to an increase of plasma concentration (AUC) of Riogutin at 193%, and therefore associated with Riogutin associated side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is necessary for clinical reasons, Riogutin together with Agenase is to be administered in at least half of the recommended dose, although no clinical data is predefined.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetical studies with Agenase in combination with Erythromycin were not performed, but the plasma cutting of both medicines could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">The simultaneous application of two times a day, 700 mg Fosampoule r and 100 mg of retoconazole once a day lead to 2,69times per day compared to the value that was observed after 200 mg Ketoconazole once a day without simultaneous use of fosheavir with Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other medicines that are listed below, including substrates, inhibitor or inductors of CYP3A4, can be used together with Agenase, possibly to interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Patients should therefore be linked to toxic reactions to be monitored by these medicines, if they are applied in combination with Agenase.</seg>

<seg id="1990">Since plasma level increases the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor in myopathy, including a Rhabdomyolysis, the combined application of this medicine is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1991">It is a common monitoring of therapeutic concentrations up to stabilization of the mirror, as the plasma concentrations of Cyclosporin, rapamycin and tacrolimus can be increased from Ambavir (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, Agenase may not be used together with oral genommenem Midazolam (see section 4.3), while for the same use of Agenase with parabolic Midazolam is careful.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for the simultaneous application of parabolic Midazolam with other protein inhibitors indicate a possible increase in plasma cutting of Midazolam around the 3-4-watch.</seg>
<seg id="1994">If methadon is administered along with Ambavir, the patient should therefore be monitored on opoz. symptoms, in particular if they are still very low doses of ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Due to the low distortion of the same time, no recommendation can be given as the amalgam dose is given when Ambavir is given at the same time with methadon.</seg>
<seg id="1996">In addition to the gift of Warfarin or other oral anticoagulants, an increased control of INR (International standardization ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of weakening or reinforcement of antithrombotic effect (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of ritonavir on hormonal contrativa is not predictable, therefore also recommended methods for the conception.</seg>
<seg id="1998">A careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example Desipramine and Nortryptilin) is recommended for the same gift from Agenase (see section 4.4).</seg>

<seg id="2027">The conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mutations or mutationsmuster may be subject to additional data, and it is recommended to tighten the current interpretations for analysis of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">Phenotypical analyses clinically validated phenotypical interpretation systems can be used in combination with the genotypical data relating to the activity of Ambavir / Ritonavir / Ritonavir / Ritonavir / Ritonavir in patients with protein resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies that distribute diagnostic resistance tests, clinically developed clinically-phenotypic cut-offs (partition points) for FPV / RTV, which can be used for interpretation of a resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four with a reduced sensitivity against Ambavir associated genetic patterns creates a certain cross-resistance against Ritonavir, which remains sensitivity against indinavir, Nelly avir and Saquinavir in general.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data available for cross-resistance between Ambavir and other prototyping for all 4 Fosampons resistor resistance, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>

<seg id="2045">The administration of Ambavir with a meal leads to a 25% decrease of AUC but has no effect on the concentration of ambavir 12 hours after dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Hence the minimum concentration in the Steady-State (Cmin, ss) remained unaffected by the food intake, although the simultaneous food intake increases the magnitude and rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l (6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg) and can be seen on a large distribution volume and an unexpected penetration of Ambavir from the tissues in the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change will lead to a decrease of the total concentration of the drug in plasma, with the amount of unborn ambavir which represents the active portion, probably remains unchanged.</seg>

<seg id="2051">The gift from Agenase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily, leads to a similar daily Ambital exposure like in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Ambavir is made of the solution 14% less flexible than out of the capsules; therefore Agenase solution and generic capsules are not interchangeable on a millionth base.</seg>
<seg id="2053">The renal cleance of Ritonavir negligible, therefore the impact of a renal function should be minor for the elimination of Ambavir and Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2054">These treatment schemata lead to amboavir plasma screens comparable to healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg Ambavir twice daily without simultaneous administration of ritonavir.</seg>

<seg id="2271">Aldurazyme is applied to treat patients with secured diagnosis of a Mubysaccharides I (MPS I; α -l-Iduronidase deficiency) to handle the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (symptoms that are not related to brain or nerves).</seg>
<seg id="2272">This means that certain substances (glyceraminoglykane, gags) are not dismantled and thus unspoiled in most organs in the body.</seg>
<seg id="2273">The following non-neurological symptoms of the MPS I can occur: enlarged liver, stiff joints, stimulating movements, reduces lung volume, heart and eye diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2274">Treatment with Aldurazyme should be monitored by a physician, experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other inherited metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2275">The administration of Aldurazyme should be carried out in a hospital or clinic with remotions, and those patients require appropriate medicines to prevent allergic reaction.</seg>

<seg id="2277">In the study, the safety of the drug was investigated, however, was also measured by its effectiveness (by decreasing the reduction of GAG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver was examined).</seg>
<seg id="2278">With children under five years of senmiazyme the GAG concentrations in the urine by approximately 60%, and half of the treated children showed a normal big liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common side effects of Aldurazyme in patients aged over five years (observed with more than 1 of 10 patients) are headache, nausea, abdominal pain, skin rash, arrays, pain in the limbs (in hands and feet), heat compassion, fever and reactions to the infusion centre.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very common adverse events in patients under five years are increased blood pressure, reduced oxygen saturation (a measurement size of lung function), tachycaring (accelerated heart rate), fever and shook.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyme may not react to patients who are possibly sensitive to laronidase or one of the other components (anaphylactic response).</seg>
<seg id="2282">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will be able to check all new information that may be known, testing and updating this summary.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The manufacturers of Aldurazyme will receive patients suffering from Aldurazyme, with respect to the reactions to the fusion and the development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">June 2003, the European Commission announced the company Genzyme Europe B.V. for placing on the placing of Aldurazyme in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a combinant form of humanoid α -l-Iduronidase and is produced using recombinant DNA technology under the use of Cho-Mammalogy-cell cultures (Chinese Hamster Oops, Eierstock of the Chinese Hamsters).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is indexed to long-time enzymes in patients with secured diagnosis of a Mubysaccharides I (MPS I, α -l-Iduronidase deficiency) to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">Treatment with Aldurazyme should be carried out by a physician, experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other hereditary metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial ininfusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient can be increased to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h every 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and efficacy of aldurazyme in adults over 65 years was not determined, and for these patients, no dosing scheme can be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Safety and efficacy of aldurazyme in patients with kidney or liver insufficiency was not determined, and for these patients, no dosing scheme can be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients with Aldurazyme treated patients may develop ininfusion-related reactions, which are defined as any adverse events which occurs during the infusion or until the end of the infusion day (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, these patients were able to continue to be monitored, and the infusion of Aldurazyme should be carried out only in an appropriate clinical environment, in the revival equipment for medical emergencies immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical phase 3 study, almost all patients IgG antibodies are involved against laronidase, usually within 3 months of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of ininfusion-related reaction must be treated with Aldurazyme with caution (see sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">As little experience regarding the recovery of the treatment after a longer interruption, must be careful because of the theoretical increased risk-reaction after a interruption of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2296">60 minutes before the start of infusion with medications (antihistamine and / or antipyrka) to minimize the potential occurrence related reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In case of light or intermediate-related reaction, treatment with antihistamines and Paracetamol / Ibuprofen response should be performed and / or a reduction of infusion rate on half of the infusion rate in which the reaction has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In case of a single, severe ininfusion reaction, the infusion must be stopped, until the symptoms were brought to decline, treatment with antihistamines and Paracetamol / Ibuprofen is necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2299">The infusion can be taken with a reduction of the infusion rate on 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate when the reaction has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 (Antihistamine and Paracetamol / Ibuprofen and / or Corticosteroids) as well as a reduction of the infusion rate on 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the previous reaction has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be used simultaneously with chloroquin or Procain, because there is a potential risk of interference with the intracell intake of Laronidase.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal experimental studies can not be found on direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">No data on newborns that were exposed to laronidase over the breast milk, is recommended, is not recommended during treatment with Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2304">In clinical trials, mainly as ininfusion-related reactions were reported that 53% of patients in the Phase 3 study (treatment duration up to 4 years) and 35% of patients were observed in the study with participants under 5 years (duration of treatment up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Undesirable drug interactions in connection with Aldurazyme, who were observed during Phase 3 years or older at a total treatment duration of up to 4 years, are often observed in the following table: very frequent (≥ 1 / 10); frequently (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-related participation of the upper respiratory work and lungs in the prehistory came out heavy reactions to, including bronze soldier, breathing and visual acuity (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children unwanted drug interactions in connection with Aldurazyme, who were reported in a phase of 20 patients with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5, with predominantly heavier and a treatment duration of up to 12 months, are listed in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenously once weekly (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">Most of the patients came to a sery version within 3 months after the treatment of a sery-version, with a heaviest frequency in the age of 5 years (on average after 45 days versus 45 days in patients at the age of 5 years and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Until the end of the Phase 3 study (or up to a premature departure from the study) were found at 13 / 45 patients with radioimmunopoiesis (RIP) Assay, among them 3 patients who never had ever had come to Serpent version.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with a lack of low antibodies levels, a robust decreasing of the GAG mirror in Harn, while patients with high antibody titres was to determine a variable reduction of GAG in Harn.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study) showed a marginal ginal effect on the enzymatic Laronidase- activity in vitro that seemed to affect clinical efficacy and / or reduction by GAG in Harn.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies seemed not to stand in connection with the incidence of undesired drug interactions, although the occurrence of unwanted drug interactions typically fell along with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The cause for the enzyme therapy is in one of the hydrolysis of accumulated substrates and the preventing a further accumulation to restoration of enzymes.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Following an intravenous infusion, Laronidase is quickly removed from circulation and cells into lysosomes, most likely about Mannose-6-phosphate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">Safety and efficacy of aldurazyme were examined in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study at 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study that had been recruited to the total health spectrum, the majority of patients from the mean phenotype and only one patient showed the heavy phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had a forcized expiratory volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected amount, and they had to be able to stand for 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for the effectiveness were the percentage of the expected FEV and the absolute walk in the 6-minute walk-test.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were then recruited for an Open-label extension study where they received another 3.5 years long (182 weeks) every week 100 E / kg Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy, patients treated with Aldurazyme treated patients compared to the placebo group an improvement of lung function and the ability to be shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">In an open extension study, an improvement and / or maintaining this effects of up to 208 weeks in deralderyme / Aldurazyme group and 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazyme group, as shown out of the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease of the expected percentage point in FEV is not significantly significantly, and the absolute pulmonary volumes increased further proportional to the height of growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of the 26 patients with an hepategalie treatment reached 22 (85%) up to the end of the study a normal liver size.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks, a clear waste of the GAG mirror was found in Harn (µg / mg of creatine) which remained constant until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">Regarding the heterogeneous disease manifestation between the patients who has been taken into account, clinically significant changes in the 6-minute walk-test, motion range of shoulder strap (58%), no change in 10 patients (22%) and deterioration in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">One year-old open phase 2 study was conducted in which mainly the safety and pharmacokinetics of Aldurazyme was investigated in 20 patients who were under 5 years of age (16 patients with severe decay form and 4 with the mean shift form).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dosage was increased due to increased GAG- mirror at Harn in week 22 in the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients, a magnitude of magnitude (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) was determined according to the Z Score for these age group (&lt; 2.5 years) and every 4 patients with severe decay form only limited or even no progress in cognitive development.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase 4 study, investigations into the coagical Impact of various Aldurazyme doses were carried out on GAG mirror in Harn, the liver volume and the 6-minute walk test.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenously once weekly (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dossier with 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks can represent with patients who have difficulties with weekly infusions, but is not detected that the long-term clinical effectiveness of these two dosing schemata is equivalent.</seg>

<seg id="2355">Alimta is used in patients who were previously untreated, in combination with cisplatin and in patients who previously used other chemotherapies, used as sole therapy.</seg>
<seg id="2356">To reduce side effects, patients during treatment with Alimta should get a corticosteroid as well as folic acid (a vitamin) and get injections of vitamin B12.</seg>
<seg id="2357">If Alimta is administered along with cisplatin, should be given an "Antiemetil" (medicine against vomiting) and liquids (to prevent fluid flow).</seg>
<seg id="2358">In patients whose blood is changed, or in which certain other side effects occur, the treatment should be removed or reduced the dose.</seg>
<seg id="2359">The active form of pemetically slows the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells that the cells split.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The conversion of Pemetre in its active form is easier in cancer cells lighter than in healthy cells, which leads to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer active period in cancer cells.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Alimta was investigated for the treatment of malignant Pleuramesotheliatom in a main study of 456 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for their disease.</seg>
<seg id="2362">In the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, the effects of Alimta were compared to 571 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease which previously had been treated with chemotherapy with the effects of docetaxel (another drug against cancer).</seg>
<seg id="2363">Alimta was also compared with gemcitabine (a further medicine against cancer), while both in combination with cisplatin in a study of 1 725 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer.</seg>

<seg id="2391">A dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadir of absolute neutrophilic number and maximum non-hematological toxicity as they were observed in the previous treatment cycles - (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lower toxicity and a reduction of degree 3 / 4 hematological toxicity such as Neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and infection with degrees 3 / 4 neutropenia was considered as a pretreatment with folic acid and vitamin B12.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore, all patients treated with Pemetically treated patients, folic acid and vitamin B12 as prophyl- lactic measure for reducing treatment-related toxicity (see section 4.2).</seg>

<seg id="2609">The effectiveness of Aloxi can be increased by the additional gift of an Corticosteroids (a drug which can be used as an antiemetaker).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The application in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended because the effects in this age group is not enough.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the active ingredient is prevented by an chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamin (5HT, also known as serotonin) to the receptors in the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Aloxi was studied in three main studies on 1 842 adults who received chemotherapies, which are strong and moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">For chemotherapies, the strong trigger for nausea and vomiting, 59% of the patients who were treated with alxi had no vomiting (132 from 223), compared to 57% of patients treated with Ondansetron patients (126 of 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">At chemotherapies, the moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting, 81% of the patients were treated with alxi in the 24 hours following chemotherapy alone (153 of 189), compared to 69% of patients treated with Ondansetron (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">For a comparison with dasetron, these values were 63% for Aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 from 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">March 2005, the European Commission announced the company of Helsinki Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd. a approval for the market placing of Aloxi in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indexed: for prevention of acute nausea and vomiting at strongly emetogenic chemotherapy due to cancer disease and vomiting in moderate chemotherapy due to cancer disease.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The efficacy of Aloxi for prevention of nausea and vomiting, which is produced by a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy alone, can be strengthened by adding a corticosteroids.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Da Palonosetron can extend the coldarmpassage, patients with anamnesty Obligation or signs of Subject Ileus should be monitored after injections.</seg>
<seg id="2620">As with other 5HT3-antagonists, however, caution of the same gift of palm osetron with pharmaceuticals, which extend the QT interval or in patients with which the QT- interval is prolong or one extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In connection with another chemical agents, Aloxi shall neither be used to treat nausea and vomiting in the days after chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical studies, Palonosetron conducts the activity of the five evaluated chemotherapeutics (cisplatin, Cyclophosphamide, cycloak, Doxorubicin and Mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">A clinical study showed no significant pharmacokinetical interaction between one-time intravenous dose of palm-osetron and a steady Metoclopramids, a CYP2D6 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In one of a population based pharmacokinetetic analysis was shown that the simultaneous gift of CYP2D6-inhibitors (dexamethasone, anodized, ritabidl, ritonavir, ritonavir, sertraline and Terbafine) had no significant effect on the clearing of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experiences about the application of pallonosetron in human pregnancies lie not before, therefore Palonosetron should not be applied for pregnant women unless it is necessary to be used by the treated doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2626">Clinical studies were the most common in a dose of 250 micrograms to observe adverse events (a total of 633 patients), which stood at least Aloxi in connection, headaches (9%) and Obligation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10.000) of survival actions and reactions on the administration site (burning, hardening, complaints and pain) were given in post-marketing experience.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage, similar to adverse events were shown as in the other dosing groups; there were no dose effects relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies were carried out due to the large distribution volume, however, there is probably no effective therapy at a Aloxi- surplus dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomized double-blind studies, 1,132 mg / m2 Cisplatin, carboplatin, ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 Cisplatin, carboplatron (half-time 4 hours) or 100 mg of Dolasetron (half-time 7.3 hours) received, that was given an intravenous intravenously to Day 1.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomised double-blind study, 667 patients who received a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and Dacarbazine of 250 or 750 mcg of pallonosetron received with patients compared to which 32 mg of Ondansetron were given that day 1 intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of studies with moderate chemotherapy and the study of strongly emetogenic chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical studies to the indication of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the effects of palm-osetron on blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters were comparable with the corresponding effects of Ondansetron and Dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">After the wounds of clinical research, Palonosetron has the ability to block the ionic and Repolarisation involved in the ventricular deformation and extend the duration of the shareholder potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study carried out at 221 healthy volunteers were the assessment of the ECG-effects of i.f.-slight pallonosetron in single doses of 0.25, 0,75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption According to intravenous gift follows a slow decrease of plasma concentrations a slow elimination of the body with an average initial half-time period of about 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and the surface under the concentration of concentrating period (AUC0- ∞) are generally proportional in the entire dose range from 0.3- 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">Following an intravenous gift of Palonosetron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, the median mean (± SD) increase in Palonosetron plasma concentration at 42 ± 34%.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Pharmacokinetic simulations indicates that once a daily intravenous gift of 0.25 mg Palonosetron reached a total value of 0.25 mg of Palonosetron on 3 consecutive days; however, the Cmax after the insertion of 0.75 mg was higher.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% are eliminated on the kidneys and approximately another 50% are converted into two primary metabolites that have less than 1% of antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro studies for metabolisation, CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 is involved in lower dimensions that are involved in the metabolism of palm-osetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination of a intravenous dose of 10 mcg / kg [14C] -Palonosetron were found approximately 80% of the dose within 144 hours in urine, Palonosetron as unchangeable ingredient made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a unique intravenous bolted injection in healthy, the total body size was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal cleance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">Indeed, in patients with severe liver function, the terminal reduction of Eliminosetron increases the average systemic exposition with palonosetron, however, a reduction of the dose is not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In clinical studies, effects were observed only after expositions that are considered adequate above the maximum humanist exposure, which indicates a small relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 out of a clinical studies suggest that Palonosetron can block only in very high concentrations of Ionite channels, which can extend to the ventricular De- und Repolarisation, and extend the action of action.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses Palonosetron (each dose resulted in some 30 times of therapeutic exposure to people), which have been given daily for two years, led to a veritable frequency of liver tumors, endocrine Neoplasms (in thyroid, pituitary, pancreermark) and skin tumors with rats, but not with mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not completely unknown, but due to the used high doses and that Aloxi is determined for one-time application, the relevance of these results are considered low for men.</seg>

<seg id="2660">In June 2006, the Committee of Humanities (CHMP) adopted a negative report in which the prevention of regulatory approval for the treatment of hepatitis C provided by Alpheon 6 million IE / ml injection solution was recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2661">This means that Alpheon of an organic medicine named Roferon-A should be similar to the same medicine named Roferon-A, which is already approved in the EU (also called reference laboratory use ").</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic (long anhalted) hepatitis C (one by virus infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">In a microscopic investigation, the liver tissue damage can also be increased to the values of the liver enzymes Alanin- Aminotransferase (ALT) in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast into which a gene (DNA) was added to the formation of the active ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The manufacturers of Alpheon laid data in front of the fields of Alpheon with Roferon-A (active structure, composition, and purity of medicines, effects, safety and efficacy in hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study on patients with hepatitis C, the efficacy of Alpheon was compared to 455 patients with the effectiveness of the reference operation.</seg>
<seg id="2667">The study was measured as many patients after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks as well as 6 months after the treatment of the medicine (i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood).</seg>

<seg id="2669">Furthermore, concerns all concerns, the data on the stability of the active ingredient and the drug are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of patients with hepatitis C, similar to the treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A, was similar in clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After adjusting the treatment with Alpheon, the disease was inflamed more than at the reference agent; Moreover, Alpheon had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Apart from this study, the medicine was used to investigate how far the medicine forms an immune response (i.e. the bodies) bodies - special proteins - against the medicine), not sufficiently validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used for the treatment of Impetigo (one with craters) and small infected Lazarities (Riss- or chives), diced and inclined wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo is not to be used for treatment of infections, caused by methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), because algo does not affect this type of infections.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be applied for patients from the age of nine months, but in patients under 18 years, the skin surface must not exceed 2% of the body surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not respond to treatment after two to three days, the doctor should examine the patient once and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial Ribosomes (parts of the bacterial cell that proteins produces) and inhibit the growth of bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">Principal Indikator of the efficacy was in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection had been cled after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of the 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of 71 patients under placebo to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected skin wounds, Altargo and Cefalexin similar response rates: if the results of both studies were taken together by skin-wounds, some 90% of the patients were interconnected to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">However, in these two studies, however, Altargo has been identified during the treatment of wasteland (eited cavities in the body tissue) or infections, causing detectable or presumably caused by MRSA, not effective enough.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effects of Altargo (which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is a maturation at the contractor.</seg>
<seg id="2683">At the conclusion, the Committee for Humanities (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the advantages of Altargo was overthrown in short-time treatment of the following superficial skin infections: • Impetigo, • infected little Lazarations, diced or brute wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">May 2007, the European Commission announced the company Glaxo Group Ltd. a approval for the market launch of Altargo in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients who shows no improvements within two to three days, are supposed to be examined and considered an alternative therapy to be considered (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In case of a Sensibilisation or serious local irritation by the application of Retapamulin Salbe the treatment is broken down, the ointment should be carefully uncertainties and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin should not be applied to treatment of infections where MRSA is known as a pathogen, or suspected of infections (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">Clinical studies with phthalmic open wounds was the efficacy of retapamulin in patients with infections, caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative therapy is to be considered as after a 2- or 3-day treatment no improvements or deterioration of the infected area.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of simultaneous use of retapamulin and other topical funds on the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous application of other topical medicines is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to the low plasma concentrations, which were achieved when humans have been reached after topical application, a clinically relevant inhibitor in vivo is not expected (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After the simultaneous gift of 2 times a day, 200 mg of ketoconazole increased the medium retapamulin (0-24) and Cmax after topical application of 1% retapamulin salbe increased from healthy adult men by 81%.</seg>

<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be given to patients with hatch disorders, as a risk for the emergence of Ösophaguszera exists if the tablets are not immediately coming into the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Every tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) sodium, corresponding to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrat, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS should therefore be used in patients with congestiver heart failure or severe kidney failure, as well as with sodium injury and oil formation only with caution.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Because Metabolisation and separation of sodium phenylbutyrat about the liver and the kidneys, AMMONAPS should be used in patients with liver or kidney failure.</seg>

<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the early-manifold form of the disease with the first symptoms in the newborn age was almost always infaust, and the disease resulted in treatment with peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids or with their stickener analogues within the first year of life to death.</seg>
<seg id="2838">By hemodialysis, the utilisation of alternative way of nitrogen oxide (sodium chloride, sodium) and possibly substitution of essential amino acids, it was possible to increase the survival rate of neutered at postpartal (however within the first month) diagnostic diseases to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy, the survival rate was 100%, but even during these patients it came with time with many spiritual disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with late manifold form of the disease (including female patients with the heterozygous membrane form of the Ornithintransplylenamylase deficiency), which were treated by a hyperammonastic end spongiform encephalopathy and a protein reduced diet, the survival rate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible in the treatment and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological state activity may occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that Phenylbutyrat is oxidized to Phenylacetate, which is conjugated in liver and kidney disease with glutamine, with phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites in plasma and primates were determined according to the gift of a single dose of 5 g sodium hydrochlorophyll and with liver cirrhosis in detail as well as repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day (not controlled trials).</seg>

<seg id="2879">Angiox is used to treat patients with "acute coronarsyndrous" (ACS, reduced blood circulation), for example when instabilty angina (heart attack) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) without "ST- Hebung" (a anomal measured value for electrocardiogram or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">Angiox is used to prevent blood clots in patients who should undergo to a PCI, a higher dose is administered and the infusion can be continued until four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can contribute to patients with Angina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study about the treatment of Angiox in sole gift or in combination with a glycoprotein-IIb / IIIa inhibitor (GPI, a different medicines for preventing blood clots) with traditional combination treatment with Heparin (another anticoagulans) and a GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">During the PCI the patient frequently used a stent (a short tube that remains in the arteries to prevent a closure) and they received additional medicines for preventing blood clots, such as Abciximab and aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">In the treatment of ACS was Angiox - with or without the gift of new events (deaths, heart attack or Revascularisation) after 30 days or a year as effective as conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients who were subjected to a PCI, Angiox was equally effective in terms of indicators as effective as Heparin, with severe bleeding, with which it was significantly more effective than Heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox may not be used in patients who may be oversensitive (allergic) against bivalirudine, other Hirudine, or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It may not be used in patients who recently had a blood circulation, as well as people with strong hypertension or severe kidney problems or a heart infection.</seg>
<seg id="2888">At the conclusion, the Committee for Humanities (CHMP) came to the conclusion that Angiox is at the treatment of ACS and during a PCI for a replacement for Heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission issued the Company The Medicines Company UK Ltd. an authorization for the placing of Angiox in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronarsyndrous (instabile Angina / Non-ST-midrange) (IA / NSTEMI)) in an emergency handle or when an early intervention is foreseen.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended initial dose of Angiox in patients with ACS is a intravenous Bolusability of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If a PCI is performed in another result, an additional Bolus of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the infusion for the duration of the surgery to 1,75 mg / kg / h should be increased.</seg>
<seg id="2893">According to the PCI, the reduced ininfusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h again can be recorded for 4 to 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Directly before the procedure is to be administered by 0.5 mg / kg, followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dosage of Angiox in patients with a PCI consists of a initiator intravenous bolster of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and one of these intravenous intravenous infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and effectiveness of a sole Bolus gift by Angiox was not examined and is not recommended, even if a short PCI procedure is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT after 5 minutes) was shortened to under 225 seconds, a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / bodyweight should be carried out.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the occurrence of low ACT values, the reconstituted and diluent medicines should be carefully mixed and administered intravenously intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">Once the ACT amounts to more than 225 seconds, a further monitoring is not necessary, provided, the 1,75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with moderate kidney-restriction (GFR 30-59 ml / min), which are subjected to a PCI (whether bivalirudine was treated with ACS or not), a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT value is under 225 seconds, a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and examining the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt of Bolusages.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with moderate kidney-compensation, which resulted in phase III- PCI study (Replace-2), which resulted in approval, the ACT had measured 5 minutes after the gift of the Bivalirudine Bolus without dose customization at an average of 366 ± 89 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="2903">3 In patients with severe kidney-compensation (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and also for dialysis patients, Angiox contraced (see below section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2904">The treatment with angiox can be redirected 30 minutes after termination of the intravenous gift of unfractionated Heparin or 8 hours after the end of the subcutaneous administration of a molecular Heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2905">• Significiosity against the active substance or other components or against Hirudine • Active blood circulation, or irreversible hypertension. • severe uncontrolled hypertension (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and dialysis charges (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and dialytic patients</seg>
<seg id="2906">Patients are carefully treated with respect to symptoms and signs of blood disorders, especially when bivalirudine is administered in combination with another anticoagulans (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even if PCI patients occur under Bivalirudin most of the arterial points of arterial points, the treatment of a percutaneous coronarintervention (PCI) may occur during treatment in principle.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients who are treated warfarin and treated with bivalirudine, a monitoring of the INR value (International standardization ratio) should be taken to ensure that the value of the treatment with bivalirudine regained its level before the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Starting from the knowledge about the action of action of antioagulants (Heparin, Warfarin, Thrombolytics or Thrombozygationemmer) can be assumed that these substances increase the risk of blood.</seg>

<seg id="2994">In a study with 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes mli- TUS showed insulin effects in the therapeutic lens range from 0,075 to 0.15 E / kg or more a proportionately increase in glukosher effect, exactly like humaninsulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin lulisin has a double so fast effects of human humanulin and achieves the complete glukosher effect about 2 hours earlier than humanulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">From the data was evident that at an application of insulin lulisin 2 minutes before meal, a comparable postpranal glycemic control is achieved as with humanistic normal insulin, which is given 30 minutes before meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">Insulin tulum was taken in 2 minutes before meal, was achieved a better postage control as with humanistic normal-insulin, which was given 2 minutes before the meal was reached.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If insulin is turned in 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal, a comparable glycemic control is given as in human normal-insulin, which is given 2 mixing grooves before the meal (see Figure 1).</seg>
