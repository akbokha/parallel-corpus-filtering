the colour of a rectangle that is switched to view color mode , can be either a depth for the easy detection of inflamm@@ ation , or the picture of a different file name like name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type .
a rectangle can be lab@@ eled with the various characteristics of the appropriate file or folder . for any feature , you may be displayed if sufficient space is provided or if the area should appear in the characters of the Tre@@ em@@ ap . in addition , you can define the relative position of the label in the rectangle .
in case algorithms for Tre@@ em@@ aps should be observed that the area is proportional to size of the entry , and this framework will not always be observed . if the frames will not be available . note that less space for the frame is lost if the rectangle is square .
as the allocation of the area of an entry for the sub@@ ordin@@ ated entries will continue to implement the implementation . here it is necessary to prevent the label and avo@@ iding space that are possible to avoid the square . the best methods in this regard are lines , columns or recur@@ sive second .
you can find the minimal booked area for an entry view on the menu . instead , a space pattern is drawn into the area of over@@ sized entry , to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a lower entry .

&amp; digi@@ plug ; provides a light table in a separate window with which you can easily compare pictures . it works with all supported image file formats , also raw files , together .
choose one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L The lamp is opened from the context menu . if you are back in &amp; digi@@ plug ; main window can be opened quickly with L ex@@ tras &apos;s light .
from the preview strip you can get the pictures you want to compare , in the left or right area of the window . if you want to preview video from the tool@@ bar and zo@@ o . you will also compare these pictures during the other image . so you can compare the same range of the two pictures .
another mode is better suited to show quickly out of a picture series . if you want to navigate in the areas of the tool bar , then you will be able to display the left mouse button on any picture . this right is displayed in the right area . this makes it easier to pass through a number of similar images .
of course , the normal soldering actions are also working directly from the light table , such as F4 file ....
all picture information from the right side panel of the master window are available for both viewing pictures in the light table . this makes it e.g. simply visual differences with exposure data .
at the lower end of each case you will find a built @-@ in sw@@ ing@@ ing function that you can click on the crossed arrow . in order to hold the visible area of the image , you need to preview this image and show the same image area in the same mode .
the zo@@ oming works as well as in other views . simply use the zoom kno@@ b below the images or C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel around in the image and out to zo@@ oming . this happens in both pictures when you &apos;re in preview .
what is a digital inventory management - out of the fashion address , after the image has been taken up to the final issue and the permanent storage . each of the photos can be sc@@ anned , sc@@ anned or digital photos , and most of us do not make this in a systematic and efficient way .
we give you a tool to secure a plan and practical tips as you can back up your pictures , protect , protecting and photos . we &apos;re looking back to use the procedures for digital photography . we consider downloading , backup , evaluate , optim@@ ise , optim@@ ise , wait , and export the image files .
&amp; quot ; Digital inventory management takes up , categorized , categorized , Supp@@ orted , trans@@ forms and exported content that hab@@ it a mon@@ ary or cultural value . quot ;
met@@ ad@@ ata is defined as data about data . met@@ ad@@ ata is defined according to your definition data , information about or a documentation of other data provided by any application or environment .
I need to claim only if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you do not need any inventory for longer a specific photo . if you don &apos;t need any inventory . if you do not want to store &amp; digi@@ al . if you do not want to store &amp; digi@@ al . if you do not want to store &amp; digi@@ al data . if you have no quick search , and secure backup to you with other programs , platforms and formats are free .
the first thing you do and know what you need to do something in your system . your image files have to be arranged som@@ eh@@ ow to your computer . you need to save if you want to save them on a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc ; make sure you need to switch off on a larger drive .
perhaps you will be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can be found quickly over your location . if you have enough photos , then you &apos;ll be able to use sub@@ folder such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . export a folder for pictures that you print or publish on a website .
professional photograph@@ ers have other requirements such as ver@@ sion@@ ing photos , archiving , work processes , constant supply of images on different themes and a large number of all . within 10 years , 95 % archives and 5 % of work files and you will not want to organize your structure for this content .
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes the stack processing easier . split new from old files .
the separation of original and desktop files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are searching for an original or derived image .
we also recommend to save the met@@ ad@@ ata option in the installation page of met@@ ad@@ ata in &amp; digi@@ plug ; if you forgot this , then you can then select the met@@ ad@@ ata from the database to the files by clicking the corresponding item in the menu album .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change ? it is &amp; digi@@ plug ; they have a met@@ ad@@ ata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important .
now , the real work , since you should select any photo pass@@ words , sh@@ ri@@ ft@@ ings and an assessment . of course you can choose the same attri@@ bute and set the value . you can start at best with the rating or the ran@@ kings . this makes sense to focus on the best photos .
try us now with key@@ words , keywords , such as you often called in other programs . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
when you import Catal@@ og@@ ised images from a different source of embedded keywords , then put the images to the right place . if you want to mount the images on the right place . if the pass@@ words are done by &amp; digi@@ ous words ; the changed pass@@ words are pursued by &amp; digi@@ s ; updated while it is pursued .
the graphics shows how different met@@ ad@@ ata has over@@ cut . this is a very rough representation since each block of met@@ ad@@ ata in truth is composed of many sections . file names and calendar data are features of all pictures .
enough the keywords - the next section refers to sh@@ ri@@ ft@@ ings or comments using the third important tool to catal@@ og@@ ging your met@@ ad@@ ata .
you want to view most ni@@ em@@ anden your photos just , you want to share them with your friends , your family , other photograph@@ ers and agencies . they are sure interested in your photos .
look at this panorama . from the distance , it &apos;s not even a nice beach panorama . if you consider it closer , then start some details , people , the place .
and now I tell you this of the landing area of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing , memories , the historical period is again present , you may even hear the silence , so you can hear your perception of this panoramic view .
for other photos look , the title may be more important than the image itself . if you show pictures , you should tell a story . if you look , the key is to save the meaning of the viewer , to help you understand what you understand what you understand .
it is fine if a picture is not perfect when it has the strength only to work with a label for yourself alone .
with &amp; digi@@ plug ; you can also export a lot of text , in an internation@@ alised al@@ pha@@ bet ( UTF @-@ 8 ) , then you can export it for a selection of images . if you want to export your images in the label and / or the title of the web Gal@@ eri@@ es@@ system . you need to tell you the story so for the open plan no second time .
do you remember the times before GPS ? as you had to find into another city without navigation system ? was it wasn &apos;t a bor@@ ing planet before Google Earth ? well , because with pictures , the train de@@ parts of the spatial presentation is now available with light speed .
the possibilities of ge@@ ol@@ oc@@ alization can be in@@ separable . I &apos;m sure that one day , in the near future , you can repeat the pictures at the recording . you can also export the pictures on the recording . you can also export the pictures by Gall@@ ery@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word game with copyright and signi@@ fies the practice to use copyright and modification of copies . the same fre@@ ed@@ oms are also valid in all changed versions , so also for the work of others .
the following description tells you what information in the installation page of &amp; digi@@ comes ; as information should be depos@@ ited :
author ( syn@@ onym for nar@@ ration and author ) : this field should add your name , or the name of the photographer , for example , if it is not desired to change the name of the photographer , then it should not be changed . this field does not support semi @-@ mate nor sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as a separ@@ ator .
car titles ( syn@@ onymous with author ) : linked with the author . this field contains the work of the photographer . examples of this website contains title like : employee photographer , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer . since this is a mer@@ mer@@ k to the author field , this must be also completed .
editor ( syn@@ onym for suppliers ) : do not use the picture below . if the photographer shall not be able to identify . if the photographer shall be listed here , which offers the picture below . if the image is a camp photo , then the picture is indicated here .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although this does not have any protection against abuse , or change the solution for this problem . for individuals , this problem is only important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and half @-@ professionals , this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is unique per image . &amp; digi@@ plug ; in the near future , there will be such a module for stack@@ ing processing .
topics : plate error , turn@@ outs , power failure , EC@@ C , transfer error , aging of storage media , restoration , redund@@ ancy , circumstances , temperature , data size , widespread aber@@ ration
of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs that were lost on the road or a fire . this type of losses are the same that you can do also at traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section , there are problems in the so @-@ called New Media .
Kro@@ ll On@@ track , the world &apos;s largest data manufacturer company , has some interesting statistics which has a data loss .
in order to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs , you can do not have any more expensive than a few years . of course you can get CDs and DVDs in archive quality . of course , you can claim your CDs and DVDs in archive quality . of course , you can claim your lifetime of 100 years for themselves . if you have a lifetime of 100 years for itself .
CD / DVD discs can be un@@ readable , but you can reduce this risk in which you can reduce good dis@@ ks and good recording devices . best DVD recording tools are not much more expensive than the cheapest but you write a lot of reliable . it &apos;s the right to select the right .
CDs and DVDs are very vulner@@ able for errors , even if you have just been written . therefore , we use a control mechanism to protect themselves . 75 % of data are only required for form@@ att@@ ing and control . despite this massive protection it is needed by chemical ageing , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc .
for defective CDs and DVDs , there is a convenient program called I@@ so@@ B@@ uster , which works on Windows and &amp; Linux ; but is not yet available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications that damaged data from damaged disk disks , HD@@ Ds , Flash@@ media , USB drive , etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs seem to win the format war against the HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disk can save 50 GB and thus says almost six times the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB . everything was , of course , also for Blu @-@ ray disk .
burn slowly with a good recording range of high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ etary format . if you are able to check out the media with a description , date &amp; author and then check out the data to the next generation of media before using the last piece of hardware or software that can read this media .
disk manufacturers retain your statistics for themselves . their manufacturers guarantees a new disk , but not the data . Google has a large field study on the fault mechanisms of hard disks : disk missing
in brief : dis@@ cos at the longest , if you are operating in the temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C , this error rate can not determine the fault errors . some of SM@@ ART inv@@ aded errors . these are especially reading errors and publishing teeth . the expected lifetime of life is between 4 and 5 years .
this is the complete losses due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also have data loss due to a power failure before you have secured the files , but these losses are normally re@@ produce without large problems .
while most electric devices should not make a lot of electrical devices . these can take heavy damage in devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed processes . these can cause severe damage , hardware components , mother@@ boards and other defects . do not protect themselves before un@@ avoid@@ able that leads to a loss of time and money .
most popular protection against power peaks is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that is absorbed and the rest . it is normally available in the form of a plug @-@ in bar . remember that no plug @-@ in connection also contains a over@@ voltage protection .
if you &apos;re looking for an over@@ voltage protection , then you should pay attention to the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . it should also make sure that it protects protection against flash , and thus protects the correct devices .
as a over@@ voltage can use each cable to your computer , you should make sure that all the peri@@ pher@@ als can be connected to your system . some manufacturers represent over@@ voltage controllers also . others provide connection options for co@@ axial cable of the cable mo@@ dems and the TV card .
if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially developed for not@@ eb@@ ooks , and therefore also contain the protection for the modem . it is ideal for travelling .
while an over@@ voltage protection in front of smaller variations in the supply lines , it will not really help you with a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of unbe@@ ar@@ able data . it may therefore make sense to invest in a interrup@@ tible power supply .
in addition to protect against over@@ voltages , these tools can be automatically shut down . if you purchase a UPS . if you buy a US@@ V , you should be sure that they are the same quality requirements such as an over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the life time of the battery and the supplied software is interesting .
consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to and compare its safety at current costs to avoid such . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can be used for less than &amp; euro ; 40 . this is just a small price difference if you think so well . at the end , you should always think all cables to tr@@ ash before you go into the holiday .
the Amazon Web Service includes S3 - simple storage service - a simple storage service . with the correct configuration , you can use this as the drive below &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to store this as backup destination for your software . Google Sh@@ ared Storage is a further popular offer that you can save any quantity of data .
they are very expensive compared to the hard drives , but very expensive - 40 GB cost &amp; dollar dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost per dollar ; 500 . furthermore , you have to send the data about the compar@@ atively slow Internet .
the solutions are therefore suitable only as a solution to a local data loss of the most important images . it is not a bad solution , but there is no general backup solution . it is too slow .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Yahoo ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the Photo Community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com make online storage services that have no longer available to photos , in case of Fli@@ ck@@ r dramatic more . for $ 25 a year , you receive unlimited memories , which should be checked in reality .
from the point of view of data backup , web solutions are very secure . transmission errors will be adjusted automatically adjusted by the TCP protocol and included in the large companies in the offer . therefore , they are des@@ ast@@ er@@ able .
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the computer . all transfers are due to transfer errors . the file system c@@ fs and b@@ ays are at least secure data integrity between operating system and hard drive .
the worst thing about it is that nobody said if this occurred in your hardware . all these disorders remain un@@ discovered until you should not have any protection against it . no one seems to have thought . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a significantly reliable data backup than that of your computer .
un@@ reliable power supplies are a further source for transmission losses , as they generate inter@@ ferences within the data streams . in normal file systems this error is un@@ noticed .
even if you are currently affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . in 2010 , you will see thousands of errors per year .
Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates , which can be very scalable to low level and can be realized under one to G@@ PL in@@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope for &amp; Linux ; and Windows available . read this article in English .
Oracle has launched an own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs fil@@ esystem . this is still in the alpha status . it uses the same protective mechanisms that is used and is also available for &amp; Linux ; but it &apos;s not part of the core .
do not estimate that these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the data losses on not@@ ebook and 46 % for the workplace systems . in not@@ eb@@ ooks , the proportion of theft is already 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less widespread than the most expensive than th@@ ieves or new installations . it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users know only very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; it was already no longer sigh@@ ted .
open Source file systems are less sus@@ cep@@ tible to data loss as propri@@ etary systems : wrong , N@@ TF@@ S is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reis@@ er@@ F@@ s , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to call the common file systems .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investig@@ ating process during an surgery is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . if a file is not completely stored before the problem is lost , it is lost .
viruses are the biggest thre@@ ats for digital data : false , theft and human mist@@ akes are the main causes of data loss .
&quot; &quot; &quot; sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ tures from fundamental physical bound@@ aries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a natural limit for these adv@@ ances . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all kinds of light sensors are not far away from this limit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today &apos;s cameras proceed in direction of 10 meg@@ api@@ x@@ el@@ sensors . even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and the end result is the Optim@@ um for Compact cameras . even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 Megapixel . for higher resolutions you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24x@@ 36@@ mm ) or greater formats .
a 750@@ GB hard drive today will receive you today for 100 &amp; euro ; so that your data is often affected by any data loss . thus , your data is often affected according to a plan and test this backup before using anything like the re@@ install of your operating system , exchange of disks or the size of hard drives .
supp@@ ose your f@@ uses on an external SATA drive daily . if , then one day , a flash strikes , you are lucky when the drive was not connected when the drive was not connected .
a disaster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget aircraft accident : fire , water , electricity , children and th@@ ieves are dangerous enough for your data . they usually affect an entire room or whole house .
therefore Des@@ ast@@ er@@ ance is always a non @-@ local storage . bring your securities up the stairs , into the adjacent house , into your office or similar .
there is another advantage of the physical separation : as mentioned above is a common cause for a data loss despite securing the pan@@ ic . if you have a backup which is not immediately available , then you can save one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all the files are to be secured . it is a moment of view without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential backup : the backup of the files have been changed since the last complete backup . generates a complete moment of short time points : the complete backup and the last differential pressure .
incre@@ mental backup : one backup of the files have been changed since the last backup . you can restore the original status at any time again . this backup comes to a ver@@ sion@@ ing system next to the next with the exception that it is only ab@@ get@@ ed and not continuous .
r@@ sync is a wonderful small tool that can easily be set up on your machines . in contrast to script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file trans@@ missions were copied . this happens if you want to increase security over ss@@ h .
secure important pictures directly after you have saved them on your computer to a DVD or another optical medium .
this approach takes you enough time to discover losses and restore life ; 130 % of the size of the work files . at the end you will have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly subscription for every month . every additional di@@ lution should be done manually after which you have made a complete review .
topics : met@@ ad@@ ata , stored in the image file stored IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP files , original , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re @-@ finding images and met@@ ad@@ ata , copy the images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , visibility , ... , use of the Internet .
in order to survive the next 40 years that , about the period of time in which you really interested in you , because you remember your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered :
because the future is un@@ fore@@ se@@ eable due to its nature . unfortunately , there is no other way to be able to leave . all 5 @-@ 8 years you should ask yourself as the current system back@@ ward . if less variants you have used in the past , so it is easier to evaluate the questions of the future .
this question should actually be answered by the explanations of this document . use or change the standards that are supported by many applications .
virtualization is now available for everyone . if you have an old system that is important to reading your pictures , then keep it on and install it in a virtual machine for a later use .
on the other hand , the Council is quite easy : if you change your computer architecture , your memory and security technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert any newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the expert pressure for the possibility to change a system in its size . this means it always increase .
let &apos;s go out that you have scal@@ ability the scal@@ ability and put the area that you want to enlarge to a dedicated disk or partition . at * nix systems such as &amp; Linux ; can copy this area and store it on a new record :
check the command d@@ mes@@ g if your new record is detected by the system , but hang it not .
&amp; / / dev / S@@ DC # Source can / dev / S@@ DC # Source can be / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of the plate in MB@@ ens ; # works with ext@@ 2,3 , FAT@@ 16 , 32 and reis@@ fs &amp; dollar / / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of travelers if necessary
open Source Standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if a day do not exist any software more , then you can create it yourself . this task will be easier by year to year .
GIF is a propri@@ etary , patented format that van@@ ishes slowly from the market . you should not use it anymore .
P@@ NG has been replaced as an open source standard to replace the GIF . it can &apos;t be fun , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC met@@ ad@@ ata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . P@@ NG can be used as many as TIFF and has a slow compression . this format would like to store you for saving your pictures .
TIFF was widely distributed as image format . TIFF can store images in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a loss@@ less compression algorithm . a problem is needed to store your pictures in this format . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG The digital neg@@ atives file format is a licensed and open raw format that was developed by Adobe Systems . D@@ NG has been developed because of the need to use met@@ ad@@ ata . a hand@@ ful camera manufacturer is now available and we hope to use the competitors &apos; Canon and Nikon .
this is probably one of the reasons why to replace the &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Met@@ ad@@ ata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a key technology which allows users to make their data into a file itself . the file information is stored using the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; saved the XML / R@@ DF .
many photograph@@ ers go in front of the original of your recording , mostly archi@@ ved in the shell format . however , it can view the met@@ ad@@ ata between the met@@ ad@@ at@@ end@@ at@@ ei and the image file , and how it &apos;s possible to use the raw format . therefore , you should check whether you use your container as a container and put everything there .
the Dublin Core Met@@ ad@@ ata Initiative is an open organization designed for fully compatible online met@@ ad@@ ata standards . the activities of D@@ C@@ MI communities , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and explan@@ atory efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of met@@ ad@@ ata standards and practices .
import pictures from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . so long the pictures on the camera are , you can use it as a temporary backup .
convert tube files to D@@ NG and store these in your raw archive . this function is not implemented yet .
for a sensitive work , you can use external programs . if you come back again with &amp; digi@@ plug ; then you should add the met@@ ad@@ ata again . these were truncated under the circumstances of the other programs .
protect the processed pictures for the copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export it just then in web galleries , en@@ code to MPEG , use in contact page , print &amp; etc .
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ plug . in the section , you can find a description as you can already add photos , which you can already add on your hard disk . the camera interface offers you many advanced settings for import@@ ing images to your Alb@@ end@@ aten@@ bank .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug ; connect this to the computer , switch the camera on the display mode and switch them . another description can be found in the manual of your camera .
if you start the camera interface , this is trying to connect to your camera . if the connection is made , the fil@@ en@@ ames will be displayed on the lower end and the pictures will be displayed on the camera . if this is the case , the fil@@ en@@ ames will be displayed on any file , photos , movies , music , etc .
before you can download the photos on your computer , you may need to see the camera information about each entry . with the lateral handles and met@@ ad@@ ata from the camera interface , you can see the characteristics of a entry or his met@@ ad@@ ata .
this dialog features file features and photo information that are internally stored by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded on your computer . note that for some digital cameras not all information available .
the rider met@@ ad@@ ata shows the internal met@@ ad@@ ata like EX@@ IF , manufacturer &apos;s specification , GPS etc. of the image . these information are the same as in the met@@ ad@@ ata side@@ bar in the main window of &amp; digi@@ came ; or the image processing . please note that these met@@ ad@@ ata is not available for some digital cameras .
the eas@@ iest way to download photos on their computer , is the click to download and then download the photos from their camera to a single album in &amp; digi@@ . . when downloading photos are not deleted and we recommend you to delete the photos stored in an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you don &apos;t want to download all photos , you can only select the desired document options of &amp; K@@ DE . once you select the photos . download the button . download the button as long as you have selected some photos .
if your camera supports this , is a option New Download . these pictures have now been downloaded from &amp; digi@@ s . in this case , the new pictures have been selected with a star in the fore@@ window . if you select this option , only the new pictures will be downloaded .
if you can download all the buttons , you can download or select a dialog with which you can select the target album , how to select the target album . details on the folder can be found in the section My albums . select the target album from the list and press OK .
after you have selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ plug ; the photos taken from the camera into the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all of the camera by clicking the button . if you want to delete the button , then you have to select this first and delete any selection .
note that there are no opportunity to recover from the camera . you should not be deleted from the camera . if you want to delete the camera from the camera . if you want to er@@ ase the camera , you should make this camera over the camera , because it &apos;s much faster than the camera .
cameras are often used as fil@@ en@@ ames for the photos often . the fil@@ en@@ ame are often util@@ ized , after taking pictures from the camera . this may be useful to integrate photos from different recording galleries . hence , it can be useful , the date and time to integrate the fil@@ en@@ ame in the fil@@ en@@ ame .
in the next section you will find options for turning and mirrors on the image and for date @-@ based washers . if you use this latter option , you will automatically create a folder per day .
the options During the transmission will open three further options , before the photos can be stored on the plate . if you select this , the corresponding entries will be copied from the EX@@ IF data into the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option , you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded pictures .
for example , if you wish to use a different file format than the standard format , you can use the pre@@ fix photo - % Y@@ - % m@@ - % H : % S . turn the option date &amp; time . for more adjustments you should read the help of the command time .
if you use the camera fil@@ en@@ ames , you have the possibility to change the fil@@ en@@ ames in lower@@ case . or in case letters , if you prefer this .
the new fil@@ en@@ ame , the &amp; digi@@ plug ; used for a photo , is below the name displayed when the camera is available in preview . its settings are saved and automatically used when you open the camera window .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; may use all information about the orientation of the camera to time recording , in order to perform automatic rotation during shut@@ ters . in the section of the met@@ ad@@ ata , you can read more details about the information that has embedded your camera in the photo .
the automatic rotation is normally switched on , and if your camera will not provide you any information ; the photo in the original orientation . if you want to turn off @-@ off , use the kno@@ b and select the Automatic rotation in the lower part of the window .
if your camera has been made information about the date you can download &amp; digi@@ al . all images with the same date are uploaded to the same sub @-@ album . all images with the same date are uploaded to the same sub @-@ album . in the section side@@ bar data you can read that information your camera could be embedded in the photos .
this option is normally switched off , and in this case stores &amp; digi@@ plug . if you want to change this option . if you want to change this option , use the kno@@ b and select the option file @-@ based sub@@ sets at the lower end of the window .
the eas@@ iest way to download from their computer to their camera is the button . choose the file selection dialog &amp; K@@ DE ; appears to select the files uploaded . you can also select more than a file with the standard &amp; K@@ DE ; methods .
after the image selection is done , asks &amp; digi@@ plug ; you where the pictures will be loaded too . select a folder selection dialog for the camera . select the folder and press OK to start the upload . the pictures will not be deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Positi@@ oning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this is a position that can be displayed on a map and can be displayed on a map . identi@@ fying the data can be carried out by American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European Galileo or any other system .
not only for professional photography , it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise ge@@ ographic place . it is not used to create an area through automatic recording of the GPS data . environmental plann@@ er , military , police , architectural office and real estate agents can use this ability .
if you have later forgotten , where the photo was made , you can open a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ plug ; if you want to find a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ plug ; users will send you to the place of the photos , or just to document this aspect , it is good to add the position data of a photos .
the question is how the GPS data is in the picture ? first , you should know that ex@@ iv@@ 2 are supported in these fields ? there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the correct hardware , via a re@@ working of the GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module to geographical references .
as far as we know there is currently no camera that has a GPS unit . but there is a few who work with GPS receivers together . either as a card module or through transmission of the data with one cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye iP@@ A@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DSLR Ric@@ oh Pro G3 Sony
the GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ p@@ sman or g@@ p@@ sb@@ abel . you need to save this data in G@@ P@@ X format , as this is the only format that is supported by the module to geographical references .
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS , that extract the data of pictures and from GPS . on the following page you can extract the same under &amp; Linux ; : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you are using the length and lat@@ itude or other data , then you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ if@@ ted Analysis of Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the sign @-@ based coordinates , such as map@@ s.@@ google .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com shows no European street maps . here are some European pages , at least in french , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe .
&amp; digi@@ came ; try to give you much control of his work processes as possible . there are many settings to set the behaviour of &amp; digi@@ s ; you have to set up in the menu settings . you can select between these settings , by clicking on the symbols of the left hand side .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can select a preview of In@@ sert Preview or Image Processing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will lay the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ plug ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you click on an entry in the main screen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this page contains as shown below , the stand @-@ did@@ act and ur@@ ly legal data . these data are automatically selected in the respective IP@@ TC data fields , if the option is selected to download the camera synchron@@ ization , which are written in the IP@@ TC fields .
car titles is a syn@@ onym of the photographer : this field should contain the professional drawing of photograph@@ ers , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is an additional description to the Autor@@ feld , this must be filled too .
publisher is a syn@@ onym for the provider : do not use this field to specify the picture . this will not be the author here . if the image is a camp photo , then the group or agency will be available here .
the IP@@ TC @-@ promotions will save data into the respective IP@@ TC field . this met@@ ad@@ ata is not included in the picture and they are not only available in the database of &amp; digi@@ plug ; these met@@ ad@@ ata is also available and they can be imported without lost .
image clips ( J@@ F@@ IF ) in JPEG pictures : this synchron@@ izes the comments that you can add to your photos , with which included in images . attention : with pictures , which already contained sh@@ ri@@ vals , they will be over@@ written by &amp; digi@@ plug ;
the page settings contains all the options for the information that appear when the mouse is hidden in the main window via a file . depending on the selected option , this information is displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ comes ; supports a number of different image formats and some video formats . to be fixed , you can add the file extensions of this list and you can easily remove the file extension in a &amp; digi@@ plug ; Alb@@ um@@ er , which has no of these extensions , was ig@@ no@@ red by &amp; digi@@ .
the default settings can be reset again by pressing the button Update to the right of each category .
the settings of the lumin@@ ance of digi@@ plug ; may not be set on this page . if you &apos;re then open to the standard size . if you have different sizes and synchron@@ ous mode , you should only use different sizes and synchron@@ ous mode . if you have one , then you can get better visibility results .
by default , the image processing has a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can switch this here . you can turn off the tool bar in full screen mode .
over@@ - and exposed areas of the image can be marked with dark or light color in the picture . these colors are set here . in the image processing , this picture can be switched on with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
with Chro@@ ma @-@ sub @-@ sampling , the pictures in a higher resolution of lumin@@ ance are encoded as in the color information . please read this article in Wikipedia on the immediate declaration .
with the P@@ NG compression , you can reduce the size of P@@ NG @-@ compression . this operation reduces the image data on time and un@@ packing . if you have a fast computer , you can set this value to high compression . this means 1 : a low and 9 compression level .
using the TIFF @-@ files , you can comp@@ ress the de@@ fl@@ ate compres@@ sing algorithm for TIFF images . this reduces the size of the TIFF images . it has no influence on the image quality , since the de@@ fl@@ ate algorithm is loss @-@ free .
with the setting @-@ less JPEG 2000 files you can save your loss . even if you have written the loss of loss , the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than during the normal JPEG . when this paragraph was written , met@@ ad@@ ata was not yet supported , but there was in the planning stage .
in previous versions of &amp; digi@@ plug ; image processing was only a picture viewer for photos . currently , it is currently developing a tool to manip@@ ulating your photos . with this dialogue you can change the image processing .
the default rate is that all green pixels are just like the pixels of the CCD sensor in sensitive to ultra@@ violet light , this option creates a bit soft , elimin@@ ates the 2x@@ 2 grid pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the white balance is used on the camera . otherwise , if set , the automatic colour balance is used .
this setting is only used when the white balance is not set . standard is a fixed color balance that was photograph@@ ed on a white map that was photograph@@ ed in sunlight .
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SLR cameras . the effect of the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images in four steps more details in the top @-@ top . for other cameras this option is ig@@ no@@ red .
the standard is the top @-@ top , so the parts of your images are built , as a pier@@ cing white in various ro@@ at@@ ches . at least , you can try out some parts of the missing information from the top to re@@ design .
this is possible because blue pixels generally do not satisfy as fast as green and red . &amp; s@@ cra@@ w , hence the missing green and red shar@@ ks are trying to re@@ design the missing blue pixels . of course , this is a question of how much color or white you want .
if you select the option , you get the possibility to set up a level . here is a value of three a compromise and can therefore be adjusted individually for any image .
put the L@@ umin@@ ance value to your taste . you have to set him somewhat higher than the standard 1 . however , this can also be made later in the image options of &amp; digi@@ plug ; image processing is small . in order to hold the time for the Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing , you should be conservative .
a demo @-@ speed algorithm is a digital image process to obtain a complete image from the partial image sensor which provides many cameras and is known as CF@@ A @-@ inter@@ pol@@ ation or colour construction .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; and D@@ cra@@ w provide you three alternatives to me : Bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dient ) was created . but it produces Far@@ bar@@ te@@ facts on the edges . Bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting if you are looking for a fast solution with an acceptable result .
if you know the colour sof@@ tening of your l@@ ent@@ ils you can set the red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for a color correction , as you can conversion during the shell conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions as these again . there are also L@@ CMS and digi@@ plug ; information as colour information from a colour space in the others are possible to translate the colors as exactly as possible .
behavior questions if a picture is opened in picture processing / color design module with raw files .
please click here the folder , such as / us@@ r / share / color / ICC or / dev / ICC , in which you store all your profiles . &amp; digi@@ plug ; studied this folder during the start .
settings of ICC profiles you have the possibility &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ash ; for your profiles can be depos@@ ited for your profiles . everything can be changed when opening the pipe file later .
the color design is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Arg@@ y@@ ll . here , only your pictures are color@@ fully maintained by the entire screen .
the input profiles should be added to the camera manufacturer and model . not all profiles are contained on the same way . currently , d@@ cra@@ w Gamma are not included for conver@@ sions at 16 @-@ bit depth . this means that you need to perform the color mapping itself .
there are further options such as the Soft @-@ Pro@@ of @-@ profile , which allows you to print a smaller colour range as your camera and some colors are therefore very satisfied as your camera and some colors are therefore very satisfied , rather than to leave on the blind algorithm of your printer .
for most cameras it is pretty obvious that colour profile with them is intended . unfortunately , a table of cameras and profiles do not fit together . this answer is of course un@@ official :
the Canon profile extension leaves the style for the target : F for an accurate style , L for landscapes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for portrait and S for standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; K@@ DE ; image plug@@ in interface . it is an interface that supports from a series of &amp; K@@ DE ; image sc@@ oring and image processing is supported ; many modules support , which are written to work with each program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . select the modules that you want to use , and these modules will appear as new entries in the menu of the master window and in addition you will find some also in the context menu of the preview .
short command for tasks that are carried out by modules can be set in the menu under settings short command .
more information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be found via the K@@ IP@@ I project under h@@ tt@@ p : / / www.@@ k@@ ip@@ i @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the Di@@ ash@@ au should be easy to understand . the upper kno@@ b adjust@@ s the time between the image inputs , normally 4 @-@ 5 seconds is good . the other check boxes switches met@@ ad@@ ata , or out which are embedded in the bottom end of the images during display .
the camera properties indicate a list of all cameras supported on the left side . if you want to use one camera that is connected to the computer , you should make sure that the camera is correctly linked , USB and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage are supported .
at the bottom end you can set the path for USB@@ - and Fire@@ Wi@@ re@@ - ( IEEE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field is only active if you need a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera . you have to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera / cr@@ ashes , specify your camera .
to use your digital camera &amp; digi@@ plug ; you have to connect the camera to your computer , and place them in the display mode .
check out if &amp; digi@@ plug ; the camera automatically det@@ ects the camera . if not , you can set camera models and port manually . after you set up your camera , your camera will appear in the menu camera .
you can choose any name for your camera . it is displayed in the menu cameras of the master window . if you own more than one camera , you can insert all here .
with the option dialog for post@@ p@@ one &gt; Pictures in the tr@@ ash@@ lei@@ derer , you can adjust the conversation of &amp; digi@@ plug ; when del@@ etion of a photos in a album , you will find further details on the del@@ etion of a photos and del@@ eting details .
the editorial modifications by the right side@@ bar can be silent through &amp; digi@@ plug ; if you use the option to use in the right side@@ bar without feedback . otherwise , you have to store the changes with the button changes .
you can also take the display of the welcome screen of &amp; digi@@ plug ; when starting to start , this will continue to take the starting grid of &amp; digi@@ plug .
the setting for new photos search for new photos search &amp; digi@@ came ; the bas@@ eline folder was deleted after new or dissolved albums / photos . if something is deleted from the base folder , asks &amp; digi@@ plug ; you think whether it is to delete this from the database .
different color schem@@ as can be used in &amp; digi@@ plug ; you can select the main window to your taste . this settings can select from the tool bar . a preview of available designs will be listed below :
these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you interested in a new design for &amp; digi@@ came ; find further information about this tutorial on this tutorial .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; contains a fast image processing with some basic tools . you can use this to view your photos and improve the image processing by one click with the left mouse button on preview of a picture and select from the &quot; text menu / Edit menu .
the image processing contains a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ s ; so you are not part of your distribution . more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules can be found in the section image processing .
a status line at the bottom edge of the window , the fil@@ en@@ ame , current fil@@ en@@ ames , magni@@ fying factor and current image size .
a menu bar at the top edge and including the tool bar for quick access to the most common functions .
the machining functions of the image processing change your photos . no of the features will be used , but before you use File Save or button Save In tool@@ bar . please note that you can &apos;t recover the original photo , as soon as you have saved the image .
you should ev@@ oke a copy of your image before you change it . you can save it with file Save as possible .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by clicking the image editing in the tool@@ bar . you lose any change that you have performed in the photo since the last store .
virtually any action of image processing can be re@@ structured or recovered . the last action can re@@ vo@@ ke you by editing the editing or re@@ produce re@@ produce from the menu .
if you often use this , you should make the keyboard ab@@ brevi@@ ation , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ z to re@@ produce and C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Um@@ sch@@ alt @-@ Z to re@@ produce re@@ produce .
if you select the &amp; L@@ MB ; in the tool@@ bar for a moment you will last longer , you will get a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all promotions will be re@@ produced or recovered .
once you started the image processing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same key@@ word by clicking the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , image below or the entries in the menu . if you have any changes to the current photo , you will be asked if you want to save this .
you can in the photo set and out in the c@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel or symbols in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the c@@ auti@@ cs menu .
to custom@@ ize a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : magni@@ fication factor automatically
view Full Screen Saver displays the photo in full screen mode . if you do not want to use the Es@@ c key . if you like this , you can get this in the Settings dialog . if you like this , you can call it from the &amp; digi@@ plug ; main window will call you . see the section to set the image processing .
if you want to print the current picture you can print out the image file image and get the default &amp; K@@ DE ; printer dialog . you can custom@@ ize the settings before you print your photo .
from the main menu , you can print individual images or whole sentences . you only need to select the images with the default methods and choose from the menu album export assistant . if you follow the assist@@ ants , you just need to make your choice .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; main window has a side panel on the right edge , which is important information and actions for the selected pictures . the same side@@ bar is available without the navigation use , even in image processing . it is displayed if one of the five riders is attached :
multiple Click on the same rider , the side@@ bar will appear and disappear again in the edge .
in the loading view , you can enter sh@@ ri@@ vals with unlimited size or insert . the text is UTF @-@ 8 compatible . that means all special characters are allowed to be used in the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC@@ - Fields , so that you can use other programs .
the IP@@ TC data are limited to ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut off after 2000 characters . if you want to use the IP@@ TC labels in other applications , you should consider this restrictions .
after you commented on , use either the button users or change to the next image , the labels will then be stored .
in addition to the user button there is a button More . with this you can read further met@@ ad@@ ata from the selected file or database . however , it is always carried out if you have selected a met@@ ad@@ ata setting , which is always written in the pictures .
the section rating shows an evaluation scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting areas . it can always be used on a picture . in order to evaluate multiple images at the same time , select this out and use the context menu .
the evaluation is written in the IP@@ TC field . the coding follows the scheme in the following table :
the search words shows a search box for fil@@ tering the keywords , the sampling and a selection box with the previously mentioned in this &amp; digi@@ plug ; meeting session displayed .
the sample tree becomes dynam@@ ically adjusted to the set search phr@@ ase . you can quickly restri@@ ct the number of possibilities in search of a key@@ word . this ability is especially useful if you have many words .
the input field at the lower end is a further relief during the input of key@@ words in a picture series . if you have entered different pass@@ words , these are stored for quick access .
keywords can also be set in a tree by identi@@ fying the appropriate check boxes . all keywords are stored in the IP@@ TC field key@@ word .
if several images are selected in the main screen and select a key@@ word in the sample tree , this will only be applied to the entire selection , if you want a selection with a key@@ word , please read the sample section .
the side@@ bar sampling filter is used to change images displayed in the main window . usually , the left side panel is used with their album , - date , search , search , search , search , search , search , search , and search results . all created pass@@ words are available .
you can also go to tags and place them . if the key@@ word has already exists , you can simply drag and set aside . if the key@@ word is already exists , you can simply pull it out of the right side@@ bar and put on the selection . then a dialog that you ask if you want to set the key@@ word .
in the upper example shows the images on a calendar day . the sampling filter is now reduced to three pictures . they were taken up with C@@ tr@@ l + a , and later it was placed . a dialog asks if this key@@ word should be set .
this search for changes will take place at any start of the program . it can also be switched off on the settings .
if you have a rule with and created , notice that it should be one or his needs , you can easily change this with double click on the text and in the control area .
( 1 ) : entry to which in the database is sought . this may be an album , name , key@@ word , image , key@@ word , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or a string that is already set in the database .
for example , you can define a Extended search for all the elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to group@@ ed options , you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule , and then to use the button . the options then look as follows :
why were Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Fli@@ ck@@ r are not listed ? the free storage space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the pictures in full resolution .
this article / tutorial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I mainly used it &amp; digi@@ s ; s concrete implementation was adapted .
the reason why you have a color@@ ized workflow , which can be seen from your camera or scanner , you can reach the colors on your monitor from your camera or scanner and that the colours will publish it on your computer or scanner and publish it from your digital dark chamber .
if the subject of color is coming , then everybody wants to express what buttons must express you . unfortunately , colour administration needs to provide you with adequate information about color management . additionally , you should make links with deeper information enable your own inform@@ al decisions to make your own inform@@ al decisions to make the desired result .
if your image work@@ flows are fulfilled every six below , then you must not take care of color management .
they work on a monitor of calibr@@ ated onto the s@@ RGB colour space . ( please find further information below )
your only other image expend@@ itu@@ res are via e @-@ mail or web , where RGB of de @-@ fac@@ to standard is .
so , if s@@ RGB so well works and life for all so easy , why should you use another colour space and make it easier to make colours about color spo@@ iled ?
a visual example of the limit@@ ing of s@@ RGB in comparison to the colors we can really see below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors we can see the hu@@ fu region , and the colors in the RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger farms , please visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ om page and then click Info and then click Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I have to control my Monitor if I decided to work only in the RGB colour space ?
Yes ! if you do not work in the RGB colour space or not , you need to use your monitor . if you have to use your monitor . if you use as a color space of s@@ RGB , then you need to use either your monitor on the s@@ RGB standard k@@ alli@@ graphic , a matching monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions to improve the image in most cases . use it therefore before you try to try a further manual processing .
the features norm@@ alize , the same , automatic and contrast extend from the menu corrected Automatic correction will automatically try out of your colors . you will have to experiment with these effects to see what is best in your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method sc@@ aled the whole image that the dar@@ k@@ est point black and the brigh@@ test point is so bright as possible without its color lock . this function is often a Mag@@ ical correction for pictures the dark or balanced .
the same method adjust@@ s the lumin@@ osity of the colors of the selected picture , so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity can be achieved as flat as possible . thereby , there is very good results for improving the contrast of a picture , sometimes it produces only rub@@ b@@ ish . it is a very powerful operation that causes either mar@@ vel at a picture or it destroyed .
automatic mode : this method maxim@@ izes the colour range in the red , green and blue channel . it determin@@ es the dark and light border tones and adjust@@ s the red , green and blue channels on the entire hist@@ o@@ gramm@@ ar area .
contrast extend : this method improves the contrast and lumin@@ osity of the RGB values of a picture through the highest possible area and maximum values of all values between . this is only visible with balanced images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white we@@ bin@@ s of &amp; digi@@ plug ; is a semi @-@ automated tool to perform the tin@@ ent of a photos .
the white @-@ off correction is a bit limited because of a colour space with 8 @-@ bit per color . if you are going to occur in the original image , which works in the raw mode , which works in 16 bit mode , so your possibilities will get better to correction better .
this tool is based on a white @-@ equ@@ al@@ izing algorithm of the copyright of Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ rome . they start with the menu entry colors white ab@@ normal@@ ization of image processing .
the window window can be adjusted in size . on the left hand , both the original image is adapted to the preview of the tool . if you want to see the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original protein , then you can click on the bottom window .
the preview of the target photos has a red mark@@ er . the L@@ umin@@ ance of the Pix@@ els under this mark@@ er is shown as vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
right above is a hist@@ ogram , so soon as you change a parameters . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , most pixels very small L@@ umin@@ ance values . with one button you can choose whether one of the three colors or your sum will be displayed . the sum will be called L@@ umin@@ aire .
the contrast of your result depends on sh@@ adows , satur@@ ation and Gamma . the sh@@ adows allows you to improve the sh@@ ading of your photos or even down di@@ mm@@ ing .
an@@ stat with the above inspec@@ tions , you should use the colour temperature pip@@ ette . press on this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the color temperature of the white @-@ balance . this type will also be set automatically the temperature and green values .
in addition , you can set the white balance with the list of pre@@ ferences . the following settings are available :
the surplus dict@@ ator increases the colors when more than a color channel of the Pix@@ els is exposed . you will get the combined result in a white indicator . this is displayed as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
buttons Save as and load exactly this . each setting of the white @-@ level you can set you in a text file and re@@ load later .
the kno@@ bs def@@ aults all the filter values back to their standard values and the corresponding neutral white @-@ equ@@ s . please note that neutral settings will be displayed as your original . if you store this screen , your original image will be changed .
you can adjust the coefficients per color channel per color channel of the processed image . 8 @-@ bit coding is better suited for high quality images . this coding requires more panel space , calcul@@ ating time and is only available for the formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , TIFF and D@@ NG .
this tool gives the same dialogue as to the processing of raw images . it uses the change and assignment of colour profiles . color mapping can be carried out by means of colour profiles . a detailed manual for the use of colour profiles can be sent to the text colour management .
another important tool is available in the menu under different color correction . this tool provides a integrated way to set up several color channels simultaneously , so you can always make it the same mist@@ akes , and you will always need the same correction . in the manual to the audio error correction can be found .
a very powerful possibility of exposure to correct is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find under colors Gra@@ dation in the menu .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool color effects introduces four colour effects , a solar panel effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on @-@ effect and an edge filter .
in times of chemical processing , Solar@@ isation , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , was a effect of the additional light . this result was the effect that brigh@@ ter areas dar@@ ker and the colors were inver@@ ted by the second lighting . the result was a part neg@@ atively of the picture . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine .
the intensity controls the solar isation . at approx . 50 % intensity shows the picture which is chem@@ ically possible . finally a further increase is finally a negative image that is not able to create phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier .
this is an example of the solar energy efficiency . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vi@@ d filter sim@@ ulates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it distingu@@ ishes itself from a satur@@ ation that he makes a stronger contra@@ sting effect that makes the colours brilliant and smooth . try it easy to emb@@ ell@@ ished many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for a unique colour film , manufactured by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film ; and thereby a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ vi@@ as is very saturated colours and also some photograph@@ ers , especially those of the barely visible landscapes , too much .
the Ne@@ on@@ ate sim@@ ulates ne@@ on@@ light on the contra@@ sting channels . the parameter level controls the brightness of the ne@@ on@@ set . in large images , the filter can over@@ load the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual to view the color contra@@ sting and the lumin@@ osity of photos in the menu under colors . once your alignment can be found in preview . once you are satisfied with the result , use the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
if you make a photo in bad lighting conditions , you can easily reduce the satur@@ ation . even in this case , the tool set for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice around satur@@ ation . all changes you can perform in preview . if they do the result , you can confirm the changes to O@@ k .
between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple leu@@ k@@ ph / contrast / Gamma is the tool to improve exposure . even if the dialog box is very complicated . even if the dialog box is very complicated , you require the area of the sli@@ der . in concrete the three sli@@ der below the hist@@ ogram .
the window contains a graph of intensity values , an hist@@ ogram , the active can@@ als or the selected area . under the graph , three sli@@ der can change in the image and the left side represents the dark and right side of the bright areas .
the eas@@ iest way to learn the control is to shift the kno@@ b and changes it , as the picture changes .
on the right hand , the original and preview of the image can be viewed dynam@@ ically , from the settings of the image , updated . on the left hand , the following options are available .
sc@@ aling : with this selection box can be adjusted if the hist@@ ogram is dominated by linear or log@@ arith@@ m@@ apped Y axis . in images the large areas of a constant color is often dominated by a single column . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ met@@ ic classification is useful .
three kno@@ b : the top for the dark tones , the medium for the bright tones and the lowest tones used for the medium tones , frequently gam@@ ma@@ c values .
the three colour twe@@ ez@@ ers can be used in preview of the original image in order to adjust the inputs of the shadow , medium and bright tones automatically . in addition there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment .
output : the output values allow manual values for each area . there are also two kno@@ b to change the output . for example , the compression of the output file can be used e.g. for the input . to create something different in the fore@@ ground .
automatic : with this button the image values are automatically set in dependence on the image values of the image .
save as and load : with these buttons , the set values are stored in the file system and later loaded , the Gim@@ p levels is used .
if you use this mode and the three colour notes , the inputs will automatically be adjusted automatically for all sh@@ adows , means and sun exposure , and click on the preview of the original image to set the inputs for red , green , blu@@ epr@@ int and L@@ umin@@ ous channels .
the option Trans@@ bel@@ ment dict@@ ator controls all the color channels to view over over@@ exposed pixel and you can view the combined result of all channels . this is a indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it &apos;s no effect on the final result .
below is an example of the alignment of the intervention applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photos . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output effects are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the correct image with ( 2 ) .
on the left hand , half of the original and the target image will be displayed dynam@@ ically in dependence on your settings . on the right hand , the following options are available :
modification : this selection box allows to set the channel to be changed from the module :
in addition to this box there are two symbols in a linear and log@@ arith@@ m@@ apped view . for pictures taken with a constant color , the linear mode of a constant color creates a wide bars . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic mode helps in this case .
for example , if you move a short vent@@ ing to the right , e.g. the bright sounds , then you can see that these bright sounds are correspon@@ dent and corresponding to the corresponding image pixels of the dar@@ ker .
on the preview of the original photos is a red mark . if you want to change this mark on the curve you want to change the original value . create a point on this line and move it on and off until the value after your taste is adjusted .
save as and load : with these buttons you can do exactly this . every curve can be saved in the file system and later loaded , the file format is the Gim@@ p curve format .
if you want to create this method and the three colour @-@ grain buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of the sh@@ atten@@ tive , medium and sunny , click the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blu@@ epr@@ int and L@@ umin@@ ous curve .
the option of the over@@ board dict@@ ator controls all the color channels . if more than one channel over@@ loaded pixels , you get the combined result . this is a indicator that you get the effect only in preview and it &apos;s no effect on the final result .
below , you can see a black @-@ and @-@ white photo that was corrected in the L@@ umin@@ ous channel . sh@@ ad@@ - and sun tones used to be applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the correct ( 2 ) .
the Channel Mi@@ xer of the digi@@ plug ; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the color shades of the photos .
the channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the shades of the images . you can process it from the menu colors Channel Mi@@ xer of image processing .
with the channel selection box , you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first note as you can correct the positive distribution and r@@ ash . the left section of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed as compared to the own rider .
the preview of the target picture has a red mark@@ er . if you set this in the image , a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram to display the corresponding color value .
the controls for the module are on the right below : regulator for red , green and construction , if you need to keep these channels . if you also use L@@ umin@@ ance , because the channel Mi@@ xer is able to preserve it the production of great black @-@ and @-@ white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black @-@ and @-@ white portraits .
sometimes , especially if you mix mon@@ och@@ rome , leads the reduction of a colour to a visible noise that occur from far@@ brau@@ schen . when the case , you can improve your mon@@ och@@ rome conversion through which you can first reduce the colour@@ less .
the Save as and loading buttons are used precisely for this purpose . any mixer setting allows you to save and then load . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel audio format .
the option Trans@@ bel@@ ment dict@@ ator controls all the color channels to view over over@@ exposed pixel and you can view the combined result of all channels . this is a indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it &apos;s no effect on the final result .
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel was re @-@ adjusted . the option L@@ umin@@ ance is enabled . the original image is activated below ( 1 ) and the working image below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography was always in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ing because of your abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photography is black / white a work step because paint pictures can easily be converted on the computer . also with a set of film roller profiles .

green filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film@@ maker with a green lens filter . this looks good , with all scenarios and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky . so similar to the 004 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) green filter .
Oran@@ filtered : sim@@ ulates a black / white film@@ maker with an orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , marine scenes and aerial photos . so similar to the 002 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Oran@@ tes .
red filters : sim@@ ulates a black / white film@@ maker with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic sky effects and can sim@@ ulate lun@@ ar to the daily time . so similar to the 003 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) rot@@ ates .
yel@@ low@@ filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film@@ maker with an yellow lens filter . this is the natural color correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) yellow filter .
Sep@@ ul@@ on : generates warm bright and medium tones throughout the sh@@ ear . this is very similar to the process of a pressure and re@@ development in a se@@ p@@ aci@@ oner . this is typical for the photos of your grand@@ mother and thus similar to the 005 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
using the digi@@ plug ; tool texture , you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to a picture .
with adding a texture to your picture , ir@@ respective whether it is a color picture or not , you can look like a wall painting on a wall . the menu entry shows picture texture and image processing can be used for it .
relief : post@@ p@@ one of this parameter to the right the depth of the depth and three @-@ dimensional texture rate increases to the picture .
a paper text effect is applied on the photo below . the original image is set ( 1 ) and modified ( 2 ) . the relief is set to 200 .
with the digi@@ plug ; tool frame can be added to a decorative frame to be added a picture .
the eye of an consider@@ ations in the limits of a photos is no easy task . a possibility to keep its attention . this is a psychological barrier for scatter@@ ing eye . using image , the module can be launched from the image processing .
type : with this parameter you set the desired frame type for your image . through a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white images ) , it is tail@@ ored to a nice three @-@ dimensional frame and decor@@ atively adds a decorative frame with pattern .
width : returns the width of the frame in percent . the value range for the width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
that is bigger than the original target picture is bigger than the original but the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the images , especially if you use the tool Fol@@ ding the aspect ratio .
with this practical tool , you can insert simple , format@@ ted text in a picture at any place . this also goes to several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply type the text and place it with the mouse . if you need the text size , the larger must be the character set . at the end , simply select the character set . at the end , simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background .
each setting which you have chosen for your text can be changed until you have been stored on the button &quot; OK . after the image has been saved , the text part of the image . it cannot be changed .
using the digi@@ plug ; tool template uses you can put a template over a picture .
the menu image template use in image processing can be used to put templates over a picture .
for templates , there are no restrictions concerning the size and orientation . you need to add the P@@ NG file format , and you should simply add your template &apos;s file size ; if you want to add sh@@ sten@@ cil bank to the &amp; digi@@ plug ; mail@@ ing@@ list digi@@ came @-@ users @ k@@ de.@@ org ..
if you use this tool for first time you have to put your sten@@ cil folder with the kno@@ b folder in dialogue . select the folder where you will be copied to the folder . this settings will be noted for the next start .
after the root folder for template has been set , a building structure of the sten@@ cil folder appears again . the selection of a folder will be updated automatically .
under the preview there are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and the position of your image .
Enlarge : this kno@@ b increases the dar@@ kened image . it is cent@@ ered around the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
smaller : this kno@@ bs resi@@ zed this button . if you want to use the template &apos;s position . if you want to use the template onto the whole image , you need to sc@@ roll the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
slide : use this button to move the template below the template . take the image and place it on the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template onto your picture . the image will then be adjusted automatically .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; provides three different tools to shar@@ pen@@ ing . each of you have pre @-@ trac@@ ts in other areas .
shar@@ pen@@ ing is a traditional tool for shar@@ pen@@ ing . it &apos;s very fast and easy , but especially in dark areas , gra@@ ined pictures .
un@@ riv@@ alled mask works on the contrast of the edges to look like a picture of shar@@ pen@@ al . you can use it to remove atmospheric Dun@@ st and makes it a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and it is copyright protected by Win@@ ston Chang .
it is possibly the best of the three , since it really improved the sharp@@ ness . it is a bit complicated in its application and has different parameters to adapt .
photos without focus and most digit@@ alised images need a correction of the sharp@@ ness . this means that the dig@@ iti@@ zation process paints can be printed along with just minimum differences when displaying the dig@@ iti@@ zation process . SLR cameras usually require more retro@@ spec@@ ulation than normal cameras for the home users .
JPEG pictures , JPEG pictures often have been used to use internal shar@@ pen@@ ing . pictures in the shell size must always be sh@@ aken during processing .
some scanner have a shar@@ pen@@ ing filter already during the reading of the picture . if you de@@ activate it , you get control of your image .
in some situations you can get usable results by taking a photo with the shar@@ pen@@ ing thro@@ wing shar@@ pen@@ ing . you can corrected using the menu entry .
you should also be careful because the results are not very natural : the sharp@@ ness is increasing the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but ampli@@ fies the noise . in general , you will find further information on the menu entry . you can find further information and a comparison of all techniques for shar@@ pen@@ ing .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cr@@ isp@@ y . the solution to correct it is much easier than it . use the tool for the switch with the menu entry . use the window on the right side of the dialog box shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter un@@ sharp is a very good tool to remove mu@@ zzle from your photos . you can see here .
the original image and preview can help edit the image . the show@@ case shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often generate good results and should be able to test the effect . if you create the shar@@ pen@@ ing mask to be strong , smo@@ kers and impression of gr@@ ats in the vicinity of sharp edges .
the radius represents a lot of pixels on each side of a edge by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . you should therefore shar@@ pen@@ ed pictures in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the wi@@ sted picture one of the original . therefore , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
the sw@@ elling value is a fra@@ ction from the maximum RGB @-@ value and to the difference difference . this way , areas can be used for a edge of the filter . in this way , areas with a soft change between killing of shar@@ pen@@ alties and therefore beauti@@ full errors are avoided in faces , Himm@@ ler and water surface .
this is an example of un@@ sharp mask filters . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and the worked picture ( 2 ) . un@@ sharp mask was applied with a radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0 .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool re@@ foc@@ usses focus an image by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copyright protected un@@ folding filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries to get a picture to &amp; quot ; on which it &apos;s a better approach to shar@@ pen@@ ing . it uses a technology called F@@ IR Vienna Fil@@ ing . it uses a better result than un@@ sharp mask . you can use it from the menu by using colors Re@@ focus on image processing .
in practice , the circular saw is much better than the Gau@@ ge &apos;s F@@ ew . however , the mathematical result is derived from the original pixel pixels , which is far influenced by the original pixel pixels , which can even influenced in most cases even very strongly of the remote pixels . the causes undes@@ irable results .
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of circular fet@@ ch . it is the most important parameters for the use of this module . for most images , the default value should be 1 good results if your image should be very un@@ sharp , but then on the sanctuary .
correlation : the correlation can help reduce ar@@ te@@ facts . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . the correlation is close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0,@@ 95 and 0,@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the sharp@@ est effect of the module .
Rau@@ sch@@ filter : an increase in the filter filter can help you to reduce ar@@ te@@ facts . however , values higher than 0.1 can be very rare . if the noise filter is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 is the image quality so bad . a usable value is 0,@@ 03 . a high value is still further contamination .
Gau@@ ge &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the Gau@@ ge &apos;s sharp@@ ness . in most cases , you should use this value to 0 to avoid anno@@ ying ar@@ te@@ facts . if you use a value of zero , you might also need to increase the correlation and / o@@ der@@ ive filter .
Mat@@ ri@@ zen@@ size : this value determin@@ es the size of the transformation matrix . if you choose large values for the circular wire or the G@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness . note the module is very slow when you select large values for this parameter . in most cases , you should select a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
the Save as and loading buttons are used exactly to this purpose . any reproduction parameters will be set for later and then can be loaded later .
try to use all cutting , colour and intensity structures on the picture before using the module .
otherwise you should use the module before you change the image . the reason for this is that much operations are not immediately visible , but then left un@@ pleasant arti@@ facts .
if you read pictures and compressed , &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to un@@ compressed image .
generally , bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ ks produces better results than shar@@ pen@@ ing . this could be caused by un@@ sharp mas@@ ks using a bigger neighborhood as shar@@ pen@@ ing .
theore@@ tically it must always generate ar@@ te@@ facts . even under optimal conditions it can never indicate that the optimum linear filter is always at least as good as the un@@ spo@@ res mask . the F@@ IR Vienna filter is often better in processing of small details .
below , you can see a comparison between different filters , on a small un@@ disputed image :
the original un@@ sharp color image must be corrected . this image has been taken with a analog camera . the un@@ focused result is attributable to un@@ sufficient light for the auto focus lens .
for more information about the methods for shar@@ pen@@ ing structure in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English under this address .
the kno@@ b line sets the un@@ sharp@@ est part of the dar@@ ken@@ ess , to create a natural P@@ up@@ ille .
the color tin@@ te enables the adapted color for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes rather than dark , you can set this here .
the tool @-@ error correction is one of the most developed tool to remove un@@ desired arti@@ facts with unprecedented speed .
the In@@ vol@@ algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE Team of the GR@@ EC CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool includes various settings as a starting point to simpli@@ fy the restoration . the available settings are listed below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings , you can use the rider Gl@@ ance and Advanced Settings .
fine post@@ ure p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the conservation of details . a value of 0.9 should get details mainly homogen@@ eous regions and details . a value of 0.9 should be found so that no shar@@ pen@@ ing is necessary . please note that it should always be subject to the direc@@ ting depend@@ ency .
direction depend@@ ency level alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value is smoo@@ ther into all directions while a value is close to 1 in one direction . JPEG ar@@ te@@ facts will produce a high value of similar patterns . JPEG ar@@ te@@ facts will be best eliminated at a value near 1 .
smoo@@ thing &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smoo@@ thing factor above all@@ es@@ . p defines the relative smoo@@ thing . set this value therefore suitable to the degree of smo@@ kers in your picture .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is necessary , as it is difficult when it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Gogh &apos;s Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect it must be higher than 3 .
repet@@ itions : returns as often the algorithm . usually ranges 1 or 2 .
angle gradu@@ al as &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of the an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic Alpha . if Alpha is small , it should also create small angles . you should select this value so much and to acceptable for your needs .
integr@@ ating stri@@ de length &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integr@@ ating stri@@ de width in pixels . you should set the value smaller than 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smoo@@ thing and never greater than 2 .
linear Inter@@ pol@@ ation use : the More to quality that you receive by selecting this option is just small . he doubles the running time . we therefore recommend it to allow him to allow him .
buttons Save as and load exactly that . each setting of image errors can be corrected in a text file and will be loaded later .
image error correction is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can still last very long and take a high CPU load . you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the kno@@ b .
below , you can see how to be removed with minor ar@@ te@@ facts . the module will be applied on a photograph that in Guatemala City was created with an analog camera . as you see , there is a bad black arti@@ fact that is caused by a bad film storage during the trip ( 1 ) and the correct image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce educational noise . it uses a copyright protected algorithm from Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides selectable image filter to remove st@@ ains and other ar@@ te@@ facts which can be removed from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or mo@@ or@@ us@@ sian ; effects of fed images from books or magazines .
if you need more information about sensors of digital cameras , you can read this tutorial in English at this tutorial .
the screenshot above shows a typical scene with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ ined noise which can be removed with this tool .
in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the windows of Advanced Settings can remain in the default settings .
radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . large values increase the time values per pixel and can display the image below the image and the color in him is sm@@ ooth@@ ed and thus smaller bug fixes .
sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness distance . this value sets the pixel distance to the front in order to adjust the edges . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter does not receive any more and smo@@ kers or dirt again .
edges : controls the edge accuracy for the edge . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong , you can &apos;t get the whole noise in the maximum , if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG ar@@ te@@ facts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance of the image . we recommend either color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smoo@@ ther process of the details .
color : controls the tolerance tolerance of the image . we recommend either color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smoo@@ ther process of the details .
Gamma : controls the g@@ amm@@ at@@ ol@@ er@@ ance of the picture . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the dar@@ ker areas , which are typically stronger than to increase . it also dirty the sh@@ ad@@ mit@@ es .
cushi@@ oning : controls the alignment of ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter@@ d@@ amping . this value defined as fast the adap@@ tive filter radius on variations of the lumin@@ ance . when he is on his minimum , noise and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter may occur on the edges . it can remove noise levels and is the recommended method for this .
save and store : these buttons are used precisely for this . all parameters for the noise reduction that you have set , can be stored into the file system and later loaded .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the fixed production was applied to the default settings .
sometimes a picture is too cr@@ isp@@ y for your purpose . the solution , which is a bit soft to shar@@ k . do this tool to switch with the menu entry , and experiment with the glass window . on the right side of the dialog box shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; photo Restau@@ ration is definitely one of reducing the most widely developed tools to reduce photography arti@@ facts .
this filter to the restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of un@@ wanted arti@@ facts , film gra@@ ins , scrat@@ ches , scrat@@ ches , cr@@ ushing , compression ar@@ te@@ facts and local mist@@ akes occurs in digital , original or later digit@@ ised images . the smoo@@ thing takes place along the image con@@ tours and receives the content as well as the human eye .
the same algorithm can be used for colour and tex@@ turing . the tex@@ ism is developed using another tool , the error correction was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE Team of GR@@ EC CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ . and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG ar@@ te@@ facts reduce the compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas it produces some compression &amp; quot ; ar@@ te@@ facts &amp; quot ; - small standards that can be displayed in un@@ compressed image . this setting should be correct .
buttons Save as and store make exactly this . every setting of photo rest@@ orations can be saved in a text file and will be loaded later .
photo @-@ Restau@@ ration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can still last very long and take a high CPU load . you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the kno@@ b .
below , you can reduce as a photo with equ@@ il@@ ateral noise . the module is applied to an Il@@ ford ( TM ) HP @-@ 5 movie with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can see the not@@ ori@@ ous film gra@@ ding of the faces . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the correct below ( 2 ) .
below , you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time , tex@@ tures can be found on an old colour photo taken by using a scanner . you can see the scan arti@@ facts and the photo paper . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the correct image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool Hot@@ pixel allows you to remove hot@@ pixel of photos that have been removed with a CCD camera . it uses algorithms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pix@@ i project that are protected by Martin Dick@@ p .
bright , t@@ ote or hot pixels are particularly high @-@ quality raw material photos , because many cameras with JPEG compression have a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixels ; and &quot; quot ; bright pixel quot ; for a photo with a dark image sub@@ trac@@ ting method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
download this file in the wi@@ z@@ ard with the button dark image . the tool will automatically determine the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the image preview .
if you have an old digital camera , it &apos;s important to take the dark image directly in the connection to discover new hot or bright pixel by CCD Def@@ ects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should download the appropriate dark image to correct image . a automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixel image . note that the assistant re@@ members the last dark image and re@@ load this automatically in the next meeting .
the image area and preview help you to correct within the image . the show@@ case shows the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are highlighted in all advantages .
choose an area to preview the defective pixel by preview and the results of the Fil@@ ters . choose the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate this pixel blocks . these are the available filter :
Dur@@ ation : there is an average of the neighbouring pixel . the resulting colour is assigned to all defective pixels . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is separately available for horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a spac@@ ing of 1 pixel ( 2 @-@ D@@ im ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ D@@ im ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ D@@ im ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ isher in the block .
square : this is the default method . all pixels with a spac@@ ing of 2 or less to the pixel block to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ D@@ im ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ D@@ im ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixel .
Kub@@ isch : all pixels with a spac@@ ing of 3 or less is moved to inter@@ pol@@ ate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ D@@ im ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ D@@ im ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ isher pixels in the block .
below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photograph , from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long expos@@ ures to see the original image has been increased to 300 % ( 1 ) and the correct image below ( 2 ) .
the digi@@ plug ; vig@@ net@@ ization correction is a tool to correct the vig@@ net@@ ization , i.e. un@@ exposed corners , an image .
wide angle lens , especially the entire sensor range cannot illumin@@ ate the entire sensor range . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ ting at which they reach the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light to the sensor there .
but he has also dis@@ advantages . many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 at aperture filters , which is impossible to hold the camera with hand . wide angle lens , also using center filter , an aperture of f / 16 or less , because otherwise un@@ riv@@ alled effects through movement arise .
with the big exposure areas of today &apos;s film and color scanner , it is possible to sim@@ ulate the effect of a C@@ enter@@ filter , which without these filter is used , the transformation with a C@@ enter@@ filter is turned on an image . the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker .
with three shelves you can control the vig@@ net@@ ization correction filter and three other exposure of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of luminous efficiency at the point of the largest density filter . the standard density amounts to 2.0 , resulting in an optical filter with a aperture adjustment of 1 , or by chance to compens@@ ate a greater degree of vig@@ net@@ ization , reduce it to compens@@ ate a small degree .
Leu@@ ch@@ strength , Con@@ tr@@ inal and Gamma @-@ Settings : the editing of an image with the vig@@ net@@ ting correction is reduced . you need to re @-@ adjust the exposure of the target image with these options , as you have to increase the settings only .
if you want a more sensitive new adjustment of the target image , let the values for lumin@@ osity / contrast / Gamma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ plug ; image editing from the menu Color Gra@@ dation .
this is an example of vig@@ net@@ ization correction to a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vig@@ net@@ ization in the corners and ( 2 ) the correct image and contrast correction was also done in the picture with this tool .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; lens separation is a tool to correct the impact of spher@@ ical lenses to photos . it uses a copyright protected algorithm from David Ho@@ d@@ son .
this tool works with geomet@@ ric distortion . colour@@ less distortion cannot be corrected using this tool .
the coefficient of the second gra@@ zing deals the general geomet@@ rical distortion of the lens and can correct the con@@ cave or con@@ vex form of the image .
the coefficient of the third degree has a similar round effect , but sh@@ allow to edges . this correction is not applied in the tool .
the coefficient of the coefficient is corrected the remote corners to the second degree . if you combine these two , any geomet@@ rical distortion can be virtually eliminated .
generally : this value controls the thickness of the distortion of the second degree . with negative values , tonn@@ age @-@ shaped distortion can be corrected and positive values .
corner : this value controls the thickness of the distortion of the distortion . this value is stronger than in the center of the image . for most lenses , the &apos; ver@@ ti@@ ces parameter has the inver@@ ted mark of the parameter .
zoom : this value sc@@ aled the image size and performs a correction of first gra@@ ding through . negative values increase while positive the image .
brigh@@ ter : this value adjustment the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values increase them .
in order to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog with a preview the distortion error correction . values can be used for your image , are stored and used at the next start as standard values .
the tonn@@ age or c@@ ienti@@ al correction should be carried out before all cutting or size changes . at the best end , you execute a picture to cut and then perform a tonn@@ age correction would be the effect of the Fal@@ se .
in order to help you the best correction of the screen shows you a vertical and horizontal relief line . move the mouse button in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines on this site . in connection , you can correct the tonn@@ age / c@@ ann@@ ular distortion with the help of the lines .
if you corrected a c@@ ienti@@ al distortion will correct the resulting image of black corners . you can remove them with the cutting tool in the menu and remove them from the image processing or via the Zoom regulator of this dialog .
for most images , the K @-@ shaped correction is sufficient . the next logical step for some moti@@ fs such as photos from the front , frames and paintings it is possible to correct all angles in the picture 90 degrees . note that if you have the camera with the hand , you always have a slight distortion of perspective .
this is an example of the tonn@@ age correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the correct image below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method to sim@@ ulate infrared film of the vaccine and org web site . filter re@@ produces the well @-@ known Il@@ ford ( TM ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ infrared film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left hand side of the window , you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rectangle with the mouse , you can consider the effect on different parts of the image .
below the preview you can set two parameters for film gra@@ fts and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . if you want to sim@@ ulate the gra@@ dient texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO kno@@ b changes the amount of film green ( chlor@@ ophyll in nature ) in conversion . green meadows are white as snow !
since the filter channels to re@@ produce infrared film , especially the green channel makes it not make sense to use the effect on black / white photos because the color information is missing .
this is an example of the infrared fil@@ mic feature applied to a landscape photo of New Zealand . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values produce a kind of A@@ ura in the top .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter trays is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to re@@ produce film gra@@ dient to your images . this is known by classic high @-@ speed films such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the films , the manufacturer of large silver gra@@ fts of phot@@ emul@@ sion .
the film grain effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . if you want to get a tim@@ eless atmosphere get rid of everyday life . if you want to use this special , gallery @-@ like , road photo , gra@@ ined view especially in your mon@@ och@@ ro@@ men photos , so you need to use this filter .
with the kno@@ b the ISO sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the gra@@ dient . if you need more values , ISO @-@ 2400 is set . if you need more body , you can use the filter several times .
this is an example of the sound@@ proof@@ ed effect on a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the modified film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter oil paintings creates the appearance of a oil painting . it uses a protected legal algorithm from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter oil paintings gives your digital pictures a nice appearance like a oil painting . natural images and styles are good for this effect .
there are two kno@@ b to influence this effect . the upper sel@@ ects the pin size between one and five . thick@@ ly brush are better suitable for large images . smoo@@ thing , the smoo@@ thing or , from the other hand , the hing@@ es .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the user is marked with ( 2 ) . brush size for this 640 pixel image is 1 and smooth 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter charcoal drawing uses paint and intensity gra@@ dient to create a carbon@@ es@@ k@@ iz@@ able . pictures whose gra@@ dients vary slowly , if you would like to imagine what scene you would have chosen you to sk@@ izz@@ ate . this would be good pictures to start .
there are two kno@@ b with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper kno@@ b cho@@ oses the pin size and the lower deviation the contrast ( glass ) .
this is an example of the carbon filter filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the modified picture ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter engraving the image in 3 @-@ D , as if it is stamped in wax . it uses a copyright protected algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter engraving is a fast tool to restore your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works especially well with images with a simple structure . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to trans@@ form the image in a gray , mon@@ dar@@ ing landscape .
the depth allows you to adjust the contrast of the filtration . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , the default setting .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the worked picture ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
using this filter group you can trans@@ form a normal photo in an artwork by distortion effect . it uses legally protected algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : divi@@ des the image in cells and can look it as if it is viewed through glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : analog to the wave blocks 1 , the image is distor@@ ted here with a different version of glass blocks .
some effects require long time to calculate and create a high CPU load . you can stop this effect at any time with the kno@@ b .
using this filter group you can trans@@ form a normal photo in an artwork by un@@ shar@@ fe effects . it uses legally protected algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom Not@@ ice : distor@@ ted the image along the ster@@ formal lines which go out from a center . this sim@@ ulates a zo@@ oming camera and thereby generates a dynamic expression of often in sports photography .
radi@@ al infin@@ ity : wi@@ ped the image by rotation of the pixel by a focal point . this sim@@ ulates the visual acuity of a rotating camera .
distance acuity : wi@@ p@@ ate the image to generate the effect of a non @-@ focused camera position . the object seems to come back in the background .
motion of motion : wi@@ p@@ ate the image by horizontal movements of pixels . this sim@@ ulates the sharp@@ ness of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train photograph@@ ing , camera .
turn@@ out Un@@ ri@@ fe : wi@@ ped the picture sof@@ tened in the dark and heavily in the bright tones . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , gl@@ amour photos or to add a warm and sub@@ til@@ ting light .
sh@@ ook @-@ shar@@ per : wi@@ p@@ ate the image by acci@@ dental shift of pixels and sim@@ ulates the sharp@@ ness of an arbitr@@ arily moving camera .
intelligent In@@ shar@@ fe : finds the Far@@ ms in the picture and wi@@ ped them without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : shares the photo in rectangular cells and then creates it to the col@@ t with an average pixel value .
some effects require long time to calculate and cause high CPU load . you can therefore break this calculation at any time with the kno@@ b .
the shelves are a nice little tool to make ra@@ drops onto your image . this gives it natural your images a n@@ asses look . it uses a Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n ur@@ he@@ ber@@ ized algorithm .
dri@@ pping size allows to change the size of the trop@@ hi@@ es . since the dri@@ pping size is not automatically reducing the size for small images . amount changes the number and density of drops . fish changes the optical effect of the drops on the picture .
you can hold with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; image editing a range freely from Reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ es . use the range , e.g. a face to stay free . if you start off the filter Reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ es , the area will remain free of ra@@ ent@@ rop@@ es .
this is an example of the filter . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the be@@ worked picture ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photograph has the wrong orientation , you can attach it through mirror or turning to the right orientation . you can find the tools in the menu transform@@ ations and transform@@ ers@@ .
photo bub@@ bles is definitely one of the most sophisticated tools developed by a photo to enlarge a minimum loss of image quality .
a picture to be smaller is simple . the big question is how you can see a picture ? how can you see a picture ? how can you see the lack of dis@@ solution ? how can you see the lack of dis@@ solution ? how can you see the lack of dis@@ solution ? how can you see the lack of dis@@ solution ? how can you see the missing information ? how can you see the missing information ? try it here and you will see it yourself .
if a photo is the wrong size you can change it on the desired size with the tool size . select the size in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog box is shown below .
the tool for size change uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to increase the pixels . if you want to increase a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool to blow @-@ up .
many educational programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. sp@@ ine inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . &amp; digi@@ plug ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE Team of the GR@@ EC CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you need to change the tool as you want to change the size . these settings are available in the rider New Size and are listed below :
the aspect ratio maintained : if this setting is activated , the new size is the aspect ratio of the original size of the original size .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is necessary , as it is difficult when it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Gogh &apos;s Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect it must be higher than 3 .
buttons Save as and load will be used exactly . each entry for photo increase can be stored as a text file and will be loaded later .
photo bub@@ bles is very fast when making it , but it can still last very long and take a high CPU load . you can break the calculation at any time with the kno@@ b .
you can see below an example of photo bub@@ bles , by adding a small color image to double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 2 ) is the result of the linear standard magni@@ fication .
the cutting of a photos is not just a common operation , but also a commonly under@@ estimated tool , you can simply use the rectangle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and drag the rectangle , then you will see this rectangle while you move your mouse .
if you want to release the mouse button , the area of the photos will be cut off . thereby , you can cut a good overview like your picture . you can move the size of the rectangle , creating a new rectangle with the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with the cut @-@ cut button in the image processing in the tool@@ bar and the photo is tail@@ ored ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the file to store or file sharing in the menu file to store the newly designed photo .
in the field of view , you can change the size of the rectangle by pressing the edges with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you have defined in dialogue remains .
in the tool Fol@@ lowing side ratio , you can specify the orientation as high @-@ format or cross @-@ format . in high @-@ format , the greater value of the height and in the lateral format is assigned .
the tool is used for aspect ratio . this means that it is always equal , regardless of whether you are centimeters , In@@ ch or any other physical size . you can see below a list of traditional sizes for phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog there exist two kno@@ bs around the selection automatically horizontal or vertically .
below in a dialogue with the Max . ratio kno@@ b to the size to the maximum possible , depending on the chosen ratio and orientation .
the tool According to the aspect ratio saves the settings depending on the image orientation ( Horizont@@ al or Ver@@ al ) . if you are stored on the image , these settings are stored in the EX@@ IF tables , so the EX@@ IF data is reflected the tail@@ ored image and not the original image .
the settings of the compositions assistance enables to help themselves to assem@@ ble your paintings better . these assi@@ sts are :
harmon@@ ious triangle : harmon@@ ic particles are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third party , harmon@@ ic triangles are designed to share a rectangle in similar harmon@@ ic triangles .
golden middle : the golden centre is a partition that is based on different natural growth model , such as the spiral of a N@@ aut@@ ilus sea or the bub@@ ble leaves of a sun@@ flower . it dives in all possible things that we can find as beautiful .
the golden division is the Ir@@ r@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used to design your tem@@ ples and pyr@@ am@@ ids in all times when you have your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your cre@@ ations a natural order and beauty .
the number runs from Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i Episode 1 , 1 , 2 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 21 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 &amp; etc . a composition that is considered as a visu@@ ally harmon@@ ious .
the golden centre provides liqu@@ e@@ fied relief lines if you have a painting . the help below are listed below :
the Golden spiral becomes a good results for your photos . in comparison to the third party , the golden spiral leads to the eye through the image . this kind of composition leads the ga@@ ze along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ ric visual river .
another rule is the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also called golden rec@@ tan@@ gles to create the golden spiral . this can be one line or different objects . this little can be just because his eye can be moved without the eye , it will fulfill its task .
the Golden triangles is also discussed by the top of the golden bra@@ ces . its ver@@ tex points are the middle points of the golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . please note that in contrast to harmon@@ ic triangles , golden triangles . diagonal of these lines can place a static object .
if you use golden triangles around your frame you create a effect of professional phot@@ ograph@@ s dynamic Sym@@ met@@ ry . try your image focus on one of the inter@@ sections and other visual information in the triangles . the result is very attractive composition that can &apos;t reach them differently .
the options are reflected and the vertical mirror can be used to reflect the harmon@@ ic particles .
with the button color , you can set the color of the relief lines . if you have a picture of many colors and a high contrast , the relief lines can be invisible . on this type , you can adjust the color of the lines to your current picture .
the Free Rotation is a tool to rotate a picture to each angle .
if you make a photo , it happens slightly that you are not exactly vertically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture where things are turned around an angle . you can repair all the camera ; image processing and the tool @-@ free rotation . choose Free rotation and adjust the target angle .
turn your image with the sli@@ der angle . the values on this sli@@ der are specified in degrees . setting the sli@@ der to 0 degrees . a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image will be shown on the right .
to help your help , the module features a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse button in the image preview to fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now , adjust the angle as described in the previous section .
once you have shot an image , you will find un@@ wanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to repair it is the function transformation from image processing .
an elegant way to cut the image . select the function automatically . choose one of the following options :
the option anti @-@ ali@@ asing sm@@ ooth@@ es the picture a bit after turning . note the above warning .
all per@@ formers transform@@ ations are carried out around the reference point of the so @-@ called reference point . this point is shown in the center of the image and is represented by a red circle .
in order to change the perspective , you need to use the red squares on the corners of your image . the preview will then be calculated automatically . on the right side of the dialog , you will find some information which help you to change the perspective :
new width : shows the width of the new image , including the empty areas which are produced through the transformation , in pixels .
new height : shows the height of the new image , including the empty areas which are produced through the transformation , in pixels .
angle left : displays the current angle in degrees at the upper left corner of the transformed surface .
angle to the right : displays the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the transformed surface .
angle left : shows the current angle in degrees at the bottom left corner of the transformed surface .
bottom right : shows the current angle in degrees at the bottom right corner of the transformed surface .
after adap@@ ting the perspective , the picture is slightly dirty . this effect is small , but two adap@@ tations produce a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you have to view the perspective , you get un@@ pleasant tri@@ angular holes at the corners . a possibility to use it is the image with transform@@ ations from image editing .
the shot tool is used to shift a part of the image in one direction . this is no rotation , the image is distor@@ ted . with other words , a rectangle is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can launch this module about transformers .
scissors your image by clicking the horizontal angle and vertical angle . if you press the angle to zero , the angle will be set to zero . a preview of the effec@@ tual is displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be shown on the right .
to help you get a vertical and horizontal line . move the mouse to a key point , like the lake , a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the lock tool to adjust your image .
after which you have carried out the image , the image will usually be sc@@ anned . for a single etching , this effect is usually negli@@ gible , but twice as much as per person , and therefore , you should avoid this .
after sl@@ ack@@ ing the image has a beautiful tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate it is the image with transform@@ ations from image editing .
&amp; digi@@ came ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats , therefore from your system and , in some cases , such as these libraries were comp@@ uted . in most distri@@ butions you can process a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ plug ;
due to this dependence of other libraries , it is impossible to give a list of all available file formats , but you will always find JPEG and TIFF among them .
digi@@ plug ; shows only files in formats to know . if the extension is listed in the list . if the extension is listed in the list . if the extension is listed in the list . you can change this list of file extension refers to &amp; digi@@ plug . in the section configuration , you will find further information .
almost all digital cameras save photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras allow you to select the format . a detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ plug ; supported both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression techniques in digital images . redund@@ ant information is reduced to save data on a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general there is better , smooth results than JPEG during the same compression ratio . the 200@@ 0s can also be saved , if this is specified in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the raw image format , you can read more information about Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Cop@@ per and Cambridge . you can read all formats images in JPEG or TIFF with the raw image conversion of &amp; digi@@ plug ; in the section configuration you can find more information about the use of modules with &amp; digi@@ plug ;
&amp; digi@@ plug ; supports the store of raw images only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is contained in &amp; digi@@ plug . all cameras can see below the web page from Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw form@@ ates the by &amp; digi@@ came ; supported :
many digital cameras support short films . these clips are often saved in the AV@@ I@@ - or MPEG format . it &apos;s no film working program and has no built @-@ in possibilities to view or edit . if you want to click on a film file , digi@@ plug &amp; K@@ DE ; settings for playback of movies to launch the program .

K@@ IP@@ I module is exported to a range of images into a K@@ ML structure . K@@ ML files can be opened and displayed with Goo@@ gle@@ Earth .
if you use steps 4 and 5 , what you can do well when the initial contrast was already very good , then you can carry out the first four steps with the module white .
many tools you need the image processing are in &amp; digi@@ s ; do not include their description here .
all image processing tools such as shar@@ pen@@ ing , turn@@ signs , noise levels , reproduction , un@@ sharp mask , etc . . use a uniform dialog box that will show the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current picture . below you will see &amp; quot ; texture user @-@ quot ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this progress bal@@ ancing shows the status of the filter to the current picture . links from him allow five buttons to change the comparison list of the fo@@ ams . these modes are :
vertically without dup@@ lic@@ ate . the left section shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the right of the selected area .
horizont@@ ally share without dup@@ lic@@ ate . the upper section shows the original and lower shows the filter applied to the range below the selected area .

horizontal parts . the upper section shows the original and the lower deviation to the effect of the filter .
&apos;@@ mouse over &apos; style : shows the preview if the mouse is not in the area and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons which you can switch on to show over@@ lay and under@@ exposure . the colours can be adjusted in the general site .
( 3 ) : the frame to select a preview . you can draw this frame with the mouse within the image and see the part of the picture you want to preview . preview in the left part of the dialog box will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the left lower corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your standard values . all settings from the last use of the module will be noted .
the page tool@@ bar features shows the essential information about the selected picture and has largely declared itself . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo characteristics : shows a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photos . these data origin@@ ates from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this rider introduces an intuitive card search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . press C@@ tr@@ l ; left mouse button on a square . press all images within this coordinates will be filtered and displayed . this is naturally contained in advance of your pictures G@@ eo @-@ data .
&amp; col@@ ore@@ dit ; is a editor for pall@@ ets files . the application can be used to edit paint pall@@ ets and to choose from colours .
the pall@@ ets files that are installed by &amp; K@@ DE ; may either apply for all system or only one user . in the latter case they are located in your personal folder for &amp; K@@ DE ; settings and hot user defined colour and last used colors .
in a dialog box , you can select from a list of installed pall@@ ets or browse the folders to files .
the cur@@ sor is displayed as a line . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
it shows the colour next to the colour . the color is described under the pallet view . here also the color name can be changed .
it can also be used to select a selection . in order to move such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cur@@ sor there . then move the mouse on the pressing left mouse button .
if the check box Bei@@ m cur@@ sor under the button color is inserted , the color is inserted either inserted or over@@ write another ; depending on whether the mode is selected either . this mode can be adjusted by clicking on the check box under Bei@@ m cur@@ sor .
a selection , which was created as described in the last section , can be used together with the actions copying , cutting and insert .
&amp; col@@ ore@@ dit ; used the following format for data in clip@@ board : for each color three values for the shares of red , green and blue and an optional color name , followed by a different color . if there are three num@@ eric values in clip@@ board , these can be inserted as a colour in &amp; col@@ ore@@ dit ;
the colors in the range and the output of the colour selection can be pulled with the mouse .
choose a color anywhere on the screen and then you can find in the color select on the left .
&amp; graphical viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ programs are not used in science , particularly in computer science , especially in computer science . so far there was no modern &amp; GUI ; contains , according to the view of the program author &amp; X11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with only few functions .
the &amp; graphical viewer ; project has set itself the objective to replace these programs by a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical user interface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; K@@ DE ; program .
&amp; graphical viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ programs are free layout programs . &amp; graph@@ ically ; shows graph@@ s with all the possibilities of a well @-@ integrated &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ programme in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; the following functions :

further required software : &amp; graphical viewer ; is a &amp; K@@ DE ; program that requires the &amp; graph@@ s ; tool &amp; dot ; for the diagram of the graphic requirements .
the main window displays the opened Graph@@ ene , each in a own sub @-@ window . at the beginning , if you open &amp; graphic window . in this case , the tool@@ bar will open only as in the bottom screen . in this case , the tool@@ bar contains just the icon and open files . Click on the first icon to open the dialog file .
after you have selected one or more &amp; dot ; files , the main window looks like in the bottom screen photo :
as you can see , an overview in the corner is displayed if the Gra@@ ph is greater than the character surface . you can select a fixed position of this overview or select this position automatically .
use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special keys , left and right with pressing &amp; Alt ; -@@ key ) ;
the zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by factor 10 . below you can see the maximum reduction of a graph .
if the file has just changed in &amp; graphical viewer ; downloaded file from another program , the following window will be displayed :
you can choose whether the Gra@@ ph should be re@@ loaded or if you want to ign@@ ore the change . you can also change your decision to change your choice later , you can use the menu item settings . you can use it , see also .
if you can open a Graph@@ end@@ at@@ ei outside a running &amp; graphical viewer ; open , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or at the command line , you have to open a new &amp; graphic viewer ; -@@ instance will be able to display or want to feature a new &amp; graph .
as in the last option , you can permanently save your choice , but these can also be retro@@ fitted with the configuration dialog .
during program start you can open all Graph@@ s of your last session . again , you can save your choice as well as later .
you can also define how the Gra@@ ph is split into several sides . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be selected freely .
if you use multiple sites , you can choose whether the parts of the graphics that are on one side are to be placed on this page . if you retain the aspect ratio , the pages are not filled out of the respective parts of the graphite .

the K@@ IP@@ I module allows tools to read new images to make new pictures and fl@@ ashed these pictures .
this module can be used to merge new images from external sources and can be used . currently , two sources can be used :
pictures scan : using the K@@ oo@@ ka interface for reading pictures from a scanner that supports images from a scanner that supports video streams , or another source like Video Stre@@ ams . this works do you have to have K@@ oo@@ ka and s@@ ane .
if you can open the menu entry pics , a dialog that lets you choose between all available sources on your computer . choose the source from which you want to get the image . you can also set the source of the source for the next time .
after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears to replace your image by default to select your image . see the image scanning , before you can read the image . the estimated file size will be displayed in the right , lower corner . in K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find more information .
check out that the window will be completely displayed , since some settings will not be displayed .
after scanning the button , you have to wait until the scan is completed and the window will have to specify the compression and type of image file . here you can select the compression and type of image file . you also need to select the folder &amp; # 160 ; you will also need to create or create the image .
screen photos can generate after you have selected in the menu Imp@@ ort@@ isation &gt; Screen photo ... selected . a window appears in which you can set the various screen phot@@ om@@ o@@ di :
select the complete working area to read a single window under the mouse .
if all their own program windows is selected , the call program will disappear , so you can see other screens and window . otherwise , if you have selected the complete working area , only the window can be read under the mouse .
the delay can be set as long screen photo , before it starts . if you need to switch on other work@@ areas , you should select this delay too high , in order to navigate there .
after the screenshot made the dialog options of the target picture with the options described above .

if you change the option the size of the photos before the up@@ loading , the photos are changed before high load in size . size is taken from the maximum size .
the maximum size can be used to determine the maximum height of the images . the size is thus altered that the aspect ratio remains constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery export is a tool for export your photo collection to a gallery server
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing , please contact the mail@@ ing@@ list of the K@@ IP@@ I Teams under K@@ DE @-@ im@@ aging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. Note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for ge@@ ographic loc@@ alization allows to add GPS coordinates into the met@@ ad@@ ata of an image and are stored in the EX@@ IF sample of the image and the loc@@ alization can be displayed in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for ge@@ ographic loc@@ alization sets tools to loc@@ al@@ ise pictures ge@@ ographic in the spher@@ ical coordinate system , which is used by GPS and Galileo is used to loc@@ alize . height , longitudinal and lat@@ itude are used .
to cor@@ related your pictures with geographical data , you need a GPS track as XML file in G@@ P@@ X format . g@@ p@@ sb@@ abel and g@@ p@@ sman can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
picture Ge@@ ograph@@ ical loc@@ alization Cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can lead a number of selected images with a GPS track .
select the pictures you want to cor@@ related the menu in the main window and call the menu . in order to load a possible correlation between time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a track file with G@@ P@@ X file . this file contains the same time to same places such as the pictures of your camera .
when the file loaded , you will display the coordinates in red . GPS track data are recorded in GMT @-@ time and thus the camera stops at GMT . this can be carried out with the time zone . put here your camera time zone .
the adjustment for the maximum time deviation is a upper deviation for the GPS time and camera time . the deviation among them will be merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you don &apos;t have a track data from a place , you can process the G@@ P@@ X file manually and add to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ related all pictures in this area .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ating and difference in minutes can be used if you have no matching data . if you know that in reality a location in a large time difference between camera and GPS , you can put this bound@@ aries here and then cor@@ related the button .
the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful if you have a set of photos on the same place . since the dialog you need to use the button OK button to set the data on the current photo .
the location can also be found with the displayed map and enlarge it . choose the relevant region , and enlarge it again . the height must always be selected manually . the card can always be changed manually . the card can be changed between card mode , satellite photo and a mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module there are possibilities to hang the GPS data to the images . here is a small script that the ex@@ i@@ ft@@ ool is used to provide a stack of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums than HTML pages .
this module can export your albums in a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.0@@ 1 . you can select the albums selected as HTML pages . the character set will be encoded as UTF @-@ 8 , to enable a best internation@@ alization .
the module has four riders on which settings can be adjusted . the rider can only select any albums . with the three buttons on the right hand you can select a large number of albums . in the area of them the Al@@ ben@@ chmarks and the text of the HTML page will appear on the right side of the HTML page .
the rider appearance defines the general look and layout for each side . this tab is a page open . if you then click on a picture , a new page will be opened on the picture . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your standard image viewer , &amp; eg ;
the rider album defines the settings where and how the gallery can be stored in all your corresponding pictures . choose a folder on which you can write a folder on the name K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export , which contains everything , will be created there .
if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF data will be stored in your original images even in the new pictures .
with other colour depth , you can change the default color depth , and the file size can also be explained . all other settings are explained .
the rider &apos;s impression allows you to adjust some of the settings from the album tab for the pictures , that are small images shown in the gallery .
a progress window shows the user as far the promotion is . press down to break the process .
if the module produces the sides , the window will not be closed automatically . you can therefore read the program messages to display whether error occurred during the generation . the web browser will be shown automatically at the end to show the preview of the gallery . press Cl@@ ose to connect the module .
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool to view images .
the K@@ IP@@ I picture viewer allows you to view a selection of images and put on them basic operations such as rot@@ ations , zo@@ oming or shift . the viewer can be made with short notice and quick access to its functions .
after launching a picture by default in full screen mode , this can be changed in a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG L@@ oss@@ less module is a tool to alter images without any quality .
this module allows to store images listed below , images in JPEG format , excluding the usual losses of quality and met@@ ad@@ ata .
the consequence of the loss @-@ free storage is that the file size rises , as no compression of the color information is taking place . these can be found e.g. at P@@ NG format .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client is a tool to connect your computer with a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing , please contact the mail@@ ing@@ list of the K@@ IP@@ I Teams under K@@ DE @-@ im@@ aging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. Note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module met@@ ad@@ ata editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact the mail@@ ing@@ list K@@ DE @-@ im@@ aging @ k@@ de.@@ org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
with the import function of met@@ ad@@ ata module , you can copy data from one image to another . choose the image selection dialog with which you want to copy the image selection dialog with which you want to copy the met@@ ad@@ ata . the data will be copied after clicking on the button OK .
this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere but not in any target format . JPEG is supported by writing . please check out ex@@ iv@@ 2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of a dip .
the MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module can be used to convert selected pictures in a MPEG video , using a defined length . this module uses M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick . between the individual images , you can add a basic image editing . you can also add a audio file in MP2 or WAV of the di@@ ker@@ au .
all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the selected video format . in addition , you can create a background color for the di@@ ash@@ au . in addition , you can use the formats DVD / X@@ VCD / SV@@ CD / VCD for your DVD player . finally , you can eventually use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
first you need to select the images that are packed in MPEG Di@@ ash@@ au , and then you can start the Module via ex@@ tras MPEG Di@@ ash@@ au .
the images selected by you are listed below image files in the portfolio . you can also change the pictures or content of the list .
after you are satisfied with your list , you should select the other settings . if you &apos;re selecting the video format , DVD , X@@ VCD , SV@@ CD and VCD . in case you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is default and most probably the right choice for Europe .
the next step , you should specify the time in seconds . the speed of the image process is fixed below . a low value produces very sudden , high contrast , very smooth image changes .
the background color can be set as next . in doubt you should leave the name and the path of the generated file , you can set it under the name of the MPEG output file .
if you want to specify a audio file under the name of the audio source file , you can start the production of the movie . depending on the speed of your computer you can now drink a coffee or drink at all the rest of your computer , if you are back again .
if a hint appears that Ko@@ di@@ ers or tools are missing , you can adapt the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick packages on the right below .
the printer driver allows you to print multiple images on a paper sheet together in standard Photo@@ variables . the combined images can also be opened automatically with the Image Processing Gim@@ p . this is useful to enhance you or to print the Gim@@ p module to direct expression .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can import images in one of three formats JPEG , TIFF or P@@ PM formats .
the conversion is based on the command line m@@ cra@@ w from Dave Coff@@ in . an original version of Him is not expect from d@@ cra@@ w , we expect the same results as the software of your camera vend@@ or . sometimes you get better results ! .
first , select the RA@@ W file to convert and run the module . the Ra@@ w @-@ image conver@@ ter window appears then in mode for a single image . you can preview the effect of your current settings on the picture .
you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option is to be adjusted if the camera settings can be adjusted for white and red / blue amplifier . if the result is not optimal , you can further process the image later .
a four @-@ colour R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected to use the contra@@ sting information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ GB@@ G switch has no effect .
once you are satisfied with the preview you can save one of the three output formats . the fil@@ en@@ ame is equal and only the extension will be adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a loss@@ less algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes .
tagged Image Format , TIFF , ret@@ ains all the information of your image and uses the loss@@ less L@@ Z@@ W compression .
in case you should select your pictures often or later , you should not use the JPEG format , as it is just a limited number of operations permitted before the image quality has deteri@@ or@@ ated . TIFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you want to choose JPEG format , the met@@ ad@@ ata is stored in the RA@@ W file , which is stored in the EX@@ IF information .
if you have adapted your settings , you can start the conversion button . if you want to re@@ open this process , you can turn off this process .
the stack@@ ing processing mode allows you to convert different images to once . use this mode if you are safe , e.g. by testing at a single picture , which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical with the version for individual images . however , this is helpful to over@@ write the possibility to over@@ write this . a preview is however not available . the progress bal@@ ancing shows how far the conversion is advanced .
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the program convert from Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of a album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the starting number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the tim@@ est@@ amps .
this module can be used to change the size of several images of a picture collection . it uses the transfer program from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can make the image smaller or enlarge . these are four types of image change provided :
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in dimension . width or height of the image will be automatically selected , depending on the image orientation , the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . here , the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to custom@@ ize your image format .
not proportional : not propor@@ tion@@ ing size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed at this option .
printing process : prepar@@ es the image for the photo pressure . the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the photo paper . the target picture , including background size , mar@@ g@@ inal size and background color , is adjusted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected pictures with your preferred E @-@ mail program . there is also possible to remove the size of the images in advance . further pictures can draw on the list of sending images and place there .
after you start the module , the pictures window will be shown with the selected images . you can add more images to a file selection dialog box with a file selection dialog . for the last selected image will be displayed on the right hand side .
you can also draw images on the picture list and add there to the list of sending images .
the button pictures will remove the selected pictures from the list of sending images .
after you have selected all the pictures you can open the New Message -@@ window of your e @-@ mail clients . you must only add the addresses and bedding . the selected pictures are already attached as app@@ endix .
don &apos;t pay attention to a lot of pictures at once . most e @-@ mail accounts are limitations for the size of sending e @-@ mails . it is possibly a good idea to send many emails if you want to send many images .
the E @-@ Mail window is used to change settings for sending the images . your configuration will be stored and re@@ used anytime until you change them .
select your e @-@ mail clients from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you &apos;ll need to specify the right path for your installation .
if you use the Google Mail Service , you must install the GM@@ ail@@ ies on your computer . you can download this here .
after the election of comments in an attached file , the comments are added to the images into a text file and is added to the email .
the P@@ NG format below the menu pictures file format is not very suitable to use the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to the loss of photo files , but if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise , we recommend the JPEG format .
if you want to select JPEG format files and original files in JPEG format , then the original ex@@ if@@ config file will be added to send pictures .
when the process is finished , the window will not be closed automatically , so you can view the status messages , in search of errors , you can see . your e @-@ mail program will automatically start at the end . with the kno@@ b you can lock this window sh@@ lie ? EN .
after starting the module advanced Di@@ ash@@ au appears to have a window with questions such as you want to have your Di@@ ash@@ au . you can choose between the selected and all images of the album .
the Open@@ GL @-@ trans@@ itions option in the presentation use very elegant images via Open@@ GL . however , you need to have a corresponding graph card , because otherwise the Di@@ ash@@ au is very slow .
the fil@@ en@@ ame option ensures that the fil@@ en@@ ame of images in the left corner is displayed during the presentation .
the loop loop ensures that the presentation in a final loop is displayed . you can then break manually with Es@@ c ;
the images can be random@@ ly select that the images are displayed in a random order . so it will not be used the sequence of images in the album .
under delay between the images can be set between the individual images . 1500 millisecon@@ ds match 1,5 seconds and are a good default . the best distance depends on your computer and the selected transition effect . you ought to test this so before you show the presentation your friends !
there are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can choose . random@@ ly cho@@ oses a different effect between each transition between the pictures .
during the Di@@ ash@@ au you can connect to a tool@@ bar at the top left screen . move the mouse into this corner for you .
with this tool@@ bar you can hold the presentation and start to start the previous and start the next image and stop the Di@@ ash@@ au .
at the lower bottom screen of screen , you can see the current fil@@ en@@ ames , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date has no documentation . if you are interested in writing , please contact the mail@@ ing@@ list of the K@@ IP@@ I Teams under K@@ DE @-@ im@@ aging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. Note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool for setting a picture as background image for the work surface .
this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of shopping , as background for your K@@ DE work surface .
once you have provided your images and videos with notes ; see picture . as you can see , see picture . as you can see by a comparison with the picture , so in people , places and in group keywords are present .
in the browser window , you can see the categories where you have entered the categories and videos with comments . additionally , there are entries to look at your hard drive and look to view the actual screen@@ ings on your hard drive and of course the current screen@@ shots . in the following is described each for itself .
if you press with the mouse on the entry , change the view of the Brow@@ sers . see picture .
if you want to select a further person , only the images are shown on which both people are visible . by this selection method , you can limit the number of displayed images from a few thousand pictures to a few more pictures .
if you have selected all the people , locations and other settings , you can view the pictures of your action area .
in the picture , each person has the same symbol before her name . you can save &amp; photo album ; however , for each person a own approach , the same applies to places , keywords and other categories which you have defined themselves . see also the image .
to view images in addition to the name , select the button , select the right outside on the tool@@ bar . please note that you can view the view for each category . please note that you can view symbols with pictures of persons and simultaneously a list of keywords ( if you have no suitable images for your search words ) .
you need to define , however , select the image for each individual person . now you can select the image reference factor for each individual person . in the window menu , you can adjust the image factor according to your wishes and therefore choose which part of the image will be displayed or truncated .
if you are searching in the main window , you will find a dialogue , which is very similar to the dialog for fixing the picture characteristics . this dialog can view it again at the picture .
if you want to enter a character sequence or descriptions of the images according to this text , you can also select a date of the file , thus e.g. 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use one area of two dates , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the bottom part of the window you can browse all pictures according to certain name , as you can see in the picture . here , on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene are depicted .
this is the user manual for &amp; photo album ; if you like to read manuals , but rather to try functions , have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo album ; and look forward to the fast , the screen photos and the introductory videos .
start &amp; photo album ; and select the first dialog , if you start &amp; photo album ; for the first time , or select the menu entry to the menu entry ; or select a few example images , and you can try the functions of &amp; photo album ; try out .
if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo album ; as a related HTML document to download .
at the bottom edge of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ albums , you can see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this strip you see here : . as the name suggests , this bar shows you data statistics about the pictures in your database .
the tim@@ eline can display several different tim@@ eline units . each strip shows a different unit . you can switch between the units , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by taking the bodies only 10 @-@ minute sections .
the tim@@ eline can be used on the following ways : you can select the shown entries preview view from the database ( if you select a date , you will always show the current date of the currently displayed images if you navigate in preview view .
you can also select a range of tim@@ eline by clicking the mouse button , and the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , so you will select the settings of this period . you can pick up the selection by clicking on a beam of the tim@@ eline .
&amp; photo album ; provides you two ways to create HTML pages with your pictures . it is integrated in &amp; photo album ; integrated and the other as module available ( see ) . in the following part of the user manual , you can create and retri@@ eve it via the HTML File menu .
before HTML pages are created you have to set some settings . these are split into the three areas of content , layout and destination . in the following field , each area is described .
first , enter the title of the super@@ st@@ ale and a description that should contain the HTML file later . on photo album ; HTML example pages do you see an example of these settings .
next , you can choose whether a &amp; photo album ; export export file is to be created on the heading page . how to find export information about export files .
for example , you can select which information is displayed on the HTML pages . for example , you can avoid information displayed on the HTML page . for example , all pictures are exported . you can not use this setting to hide certain pictures before specific viewer .
in this section you can define how the HTML pages should look like . most setting options are unique , which is why not specifically received in this area .
below on the page you can watch different resolutions for the images . thereby , those who have to view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution of 800x600 , no pictures more download , for example a resolution of 1600@@ x@@ 1200 .
you can change the resolution at any time you can change the resolution at any time . it can thus browse your images with low resolution , as well as a larger transmission time , it changes to a higher resolution .
in this setting area you place the various folder and URL where your website is stored .
at best , select a basic folder for all your HTML files and for each subsequent set of a new sub@@ folder .
first , you will need to select the main folder where all your images are stored . this folder will be stored and select the default location for all future images . here you can select either a folder or a folder from K@@ DE , for example :
after you have created your images , you can check if this really are all for viewing , a web browser , after the pages were created , the URL you should be set here . otherwise the web browser should start in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files created by you do not need to copy it manually in the final target folder , check it manually . thus , you need to specify the final target of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folders in which all sub @-@ folders are located .
the just described options described here have all three to basic folders or UR@@ Ls . in these , a sub @-@ folder will create , whose name you can define the folder folder .
if you &apos;re looking at a family celebration , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; photo album ; if you want to view a HTML page for viewing the images , you would like to go on the pictures , recording , etc . , then you have to do with &amp; photo album ; this work must not even make .
with &amp; photo album ; you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ im file . you can import other into your database . the bil@@ ites are imported with ex@@ - and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im -@@ files , internal and external . they distinguish themselves if the images itself is stored in the file , that you can have all pictures together , and this file can be saved as independent . the obvious dis@@ advantage is however the file size .
you can select a .@@ k@@ im file directly from the menu file exp@@ orting ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file along with a HTML file , this is an external .@@ k@@ im file .
one external .@@ k@@ im file sear@@ ches the images on two times . first , the images that are given in the file of .@@ k@@ im -@@ file . if you are searching for creating the HTML files , it is possible only if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using HTML export .
the following is described in the following dialog for exp@@ orting images which allows you to export over the menu file ...
the most important option of this dialog is to act whether internal or external .@@ k@@ im files should act . there are the following three selection options available :
to copy manuals to the .@@ k@@ im file , you need to copy the images in the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im @-@ file .
copying the .@@ k@@ im file to copy the .@@ k@@ im file to the .@@ k@@ im file , you can copy the images automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im -@@ files are normal Zip files . as most images are already compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small it is usually worth to comp@@ ress the files . if you want to comp@@ ress this , then simply select the export file .
the last option of this page is maximum image size limit . if you would like to send your friends , as the .@@ k@@ im file would not be very large . here you can limit the size , by example you can say that each picture is at most 800 pixels high and wide .
if you select a file with the En@@ ter .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu file impor@@ ter ... select &amp; photo album ; the exported database as described in .
the Assistent for import@@ ing consists of four steps . first , you need to select which pictures you want to import them , in which folders should be copied to import pictures .
it may be that you can person@@ al@@ ise the category persons of the import file ( if you are a Dan@@ e ) , while this category is asked for your database . therefore , you will be imported into the third dialog window that are to be imported into the following categories of imported file and correspond to these categories in your database .
in the fourth step , you can check the categories of the imported file with the categories of your current database . one example will see you on the picture .
it must be simple to browse images and look : if you see images , you would like to see images of your Italy &apos;s vacation and see a picture with your friend , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is shown .
in this manual you will find the information about your pictures ( 1 ) the information about your pictures , over ( 2 ) the search and look , up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and adap@@ table options .
K@@ Photo@@ album was started as a program to manage your pictures . but it was extended and today it takes care . in many places in this manual will be spoken about images but frequently , this also closes videos with one .
&amp; photo album ; stores all of its information in the d@@ x@@ .x@@ ml file and saves you with a program of your choice , e.g. Normal backup tools , copy to a disk or re@@ visions in CV@@ S where you want to secure .
&amp; photo album ; re@@ members the folder where your images are stored and used this with future Star@@ ts ; if you want to start another folder with images , you can start &amp; photo album ; with the option -@@ c . as an example : photo album -@@ c ~ / Company / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
via the menu entry settings ; set up ... proceed to a window , with which you can change the settings of &amp; photo album ; change in the following section of the user manual you will be explained in the following section of the user interface .
on the left you can see six different icons with which you can claim a preview of Preview and options for viewing the viewer . for each setting , you can call a button transfer to the F1 key and a click on the desired option .
it was described here as you can create several features for each picture , e.g. persons , locations and tags . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums .
to see the dialog , which is used to process existing groups . for any existing group you can select a label and a symbol .
in the section sub@@ categories , sub@@ categories have already mentioned . in the dialog , you can address complete member groups , i.e. , all members of a group set up once in a group instead of all groups of a central gli@@ des as in .
in view , you can see the setting options , which you want to configure the member groups . in the left window versions , you can select the category with the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories .
&amp; photo album ; the modular system with other graphics applications , such as digi@@ k@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this modular system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; K@@ DE ; image plug@@ in interface . you can find on the homepage of K@@ ip@@ i .
the modules can be called upon the menu modules . the modules can not be described , as it can not be distributed as part of &amp; photo album ; but most modules have a help @-@ page you can use via the modules itself .
as the modules of multiple applications can be used together , it can be able to test the modules with &amp; photo album ; only very little modules can be first tested with the command &gt; k@@ photoelectric Album -@@ Demo &lt; user@@ name \ &gt; or via the menu Help . do not say , I would not have warned you !
the applications that use the modules over K@@ IP@@ I , are very different , making it possible that some modules with &amp; b photo album ; do not work . this is the dis@@ advantage if you share functions with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; photo album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications can not support their images in albums ; this kind of order is not supported , sim@@ ulates it for some memory modules , so you can use the functions with &amp; photo album .
this is sim@@ ulated &amp; photo album ; the current album , which corresponds to the current view , so all images that shows the picture preview at the moment .
in addition to the current album , &amp; photo album ; the modules also has a list of albums . here goes &amp; photo album ; as follows :
if &amp; photo album ; s browser shows the contents of a category , for example all people , then each entry of this category is an album for the module .
or the category will be used as a category for virtual albums . if you use the category for virtual albums , so if you wish to use the category persons , so if you had selected persons to view and to view it .
since some modules with &amp; photo album ; you can not be compatible from the list of modules . start the dialog box and select the modules installed in the modules installed .
on the picture you can see an example of a starting screen as soon as you &amp; k@@ photo album ; starting with your own pictures .
as you can see it from any other K@@ DE application , you can see above an menu and a tool@@ bar . in the tool@@ bar , you can see any information about your pictures . in the section , we will show you back on this window , but now just click on the entry pics , which shows you an overview of all existing pictures .
one of the main features of &amp; photo album ; is the possibility to view any image with notes . if the image has been recorded separately or for a larger number of pictures specific notes . if shown on all images Jes@@ per is depicted and all pictures in Copenhagen have been taken .
all these notes may be used for searching and Brow@@ se , as you can read in the section . if you want to check this comment when you use the built @-@ in viewer .
in view three lists with a text field by using persons , places and search words . these are a very important part of &amp; photo album ; as you will always use it again if you want to enter information about your pictures .
the following idea is the post@@ p@@ one of the pictures within the list : if you have a family celebration , and on all 50 pictures , the same 5 @-@ 10 persons can be m@@ apped , this means that the used names are moved up , can be found faster and arrange .
if you prefer to get a alphabet@@ ically sorted list , click on the symbol for sorting after date under the list .
if you want to select any notes for each picture you would like to edit any selected pictures and add these pictures with notes . Click on the right and back buttons which are located under the preview of the picture on the right .
if you have several pictures , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to mark all these pictures and add the menu item multiple entries to once with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all available in the USA . there are also San Francisco and Los Angeles in California .
on the picture you can see a browser window of the United States as a sur@@ group . in order to show you it is a over@@ lap , a special symbol will be displayed .
in the context menu of the feature dial@@ ogs it is possible to add an entry into a pre @-@ existing or sub@@ category . additionally , you can also go to a category and place this entry to a sub@@ category of this entry . attention , this assumes that you just sort your categories in alphabetical order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move the individual elements of the feature dial@@ ogs by clicking the cor@@ dial that form the upper edge of the frame , click &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you can also make your own window by using it outside the window range . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have adapted the look of the window that you are adapted to your needs , click on the button options ... , which offers you the opportunity to save the current setup and the look of the window .
you can also leave a frame . if you want to finish this window later , use the button options ... and here a window appears . this process can be seen in the picture .
if you want to view images in browser , you will find an overview with preview images of the currently selected pictures , or all images , if you have no filter . you can easily configure the size of the mouse , simply follow the mouse with the middle mouse button . try it just once .
if you have an image on the background of your desktop , this image will be set up as background image for your desktop .
once you click on a picture , this is shown in the picture viewer . if you have no windows open with a picture viewer , a new display window will be created .
you can delete pictures in the picture shows . just select the corresponding pictures from you want to delete and press the Edit menu button or select the Edit menu . now you can see the window that you can see in the picture .
&amp; photo album ; you can also use a solution for this problem . you can also use &amp; photo album ; you can also use the images somewhere else . in the picture you can see images of &amp; photo album ; if not all the photos can be loaded from the hard disk .
pictures , where the right upper corner is cut off , not on the hard disk . this is not available for pictures 5 @-@ 9 , but you can see the preview of this pictures . you can also see this pictures with the picture viewer .
as you see this function you need to copy files from folders and to copy it again . if you want to avoid the inser@@ ting of the respective CD . if you want to avoid any other hard disk images , please buy a larger hard drive to save all pictures .
in the menu pictures you can find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , fil@@ tering the images so that you can see any images that may see your little sister , and choose the menu entry All except for current view .
with this , you have set that images in the case of the F@@ everything should be hidden . if you have blo@@ cked your little sister , just select the images that you have blo@@ cked , when you want to get blo@@ cked , click on sper@@ re .
it is also possible to set a password to un@@ lock the images to un@@ lock the images . to create this password , select your password in the menu privacy .
please remember that this picture protection isn &apos;t sure to read or delete all the images on the hard disk and the other , which can be found on the file d@@ x@@ .x@@ ml . this kind of password protection is only intended to read the password with &amp; photo album ; not very familiar to hide the look at private images .
the reason why you have all your pictures with &amp; photo album ; manage and watch over hours of course you want to describe them sometime . from this reason , it has a photo album ; from this reason , you can preview it from preview , as described in .
the viewer can be seen in view of course . it shows the picture , but additional all the information about the image , such as who is on the picture , when and where was it done , etc .
if the Info@@ box on the upper part of the picture you want to see , so you can easily remove what information is displayed and if any information can be displayed on the viewer . all these options are available upon the viewer . all these options are available after a right click on the viewer .
some words in the Info@@ box are under@@ lined . if you click here . if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser shows you all pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you had selected persons from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene selected .
if you have uploaded multiple images in the viewer , you can switch between them and upload the keys image high and picture . you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and end . these features are also available from the context menu .
if several images are loaded on the viewer , you can download this as a Di@@ ash@@ au . &amp; k@@ photoelectric Album ; then you can download it a new picture after a few seconds . how often it can be controlled by clicking the C@@ tr@@ l &apos;s C@@ tr@@ l button ; S .
a very useful ability of the viewer &apos;s image album is to switch to the screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the complete place on the screen . simply use the input button to switch and back to the screen mode .
if you use the viewer in the image , you can simply use a rectangle with the mouse button . with the Min@@ us button , you can return r@@ aus@@ zo@@ oming The plus button zo@@ om@@ t is shown in the center of the picture . shows how a zoom rectangle is marked and displays the results of Z@@ OO@@ MS .
with the point @-@ button you can reset your zoom , so that the image will not be shown on the Z@@ OO@@ MS , so that each pixel corresponds to a pixel image of the image .
note that the only zo@@ om@@ operations that work in videos do not work with the Plus@@ - and mini @-@ button .
you can turn the image from the context menu . this does not work with videos . you can do notes on the actual picture with the menu item notes from the context menu .
if you &apos;re looking at images , you can find a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten on the picture . at the moment you can open the picture and configuration dialog for the image to mark these names . but you may be able to mark the image and see further pictures .
another situation is that you want to get a number of images to a printer to get the images on paper . in order to see what photos you can start the viewer with the pictures and do it as well or bad , while you can view one after the other .
for the two examples above you can view the viewer &apos;s possibility to view images with features , while you can view them . features are the letters A to Z and you can press a feature that you can check the corresponding letters . in order to see the features A , B and C .
once you have set features on your images , you can see them in your browser . if you have all pictures you edit , print , or whatever you have selected , simply add a module to copy the selected pictures to a CD or whatever you want .
categories and especially characteristics can be displayed in the preview view . if you can view categories in DR@@ E , then you can press features to the pictures by pressing the letters for the feature , after the image was chosen . this can be seen here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case , you will allow you &amp; photo album ; on the picture to paint .
the ground @-@ old is not saved with the image , but in the database . on the way you can re@@ vo@@ ke your mixture later .
you can see a picture on the painted picture . in order to switch the painting by &amp; photo album ; select on the picture from the context menu . simply turn the cross in the tool@@ bar top at the window .
to work with &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; you need to have the application of the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; do not complete , but the documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; should you absolutely read and understood .
in the object tree you can choose individual objects . then their properties in the object features are shown and the object in the wire mod@@ ell@@ - views yellow .
you can also select several objects at the same time . but not the object of an already selected object , since all objects are already selected with the object .
to insert a new object in object tree , select the position to insert the object and click on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu entry in the menu .
in turn , there are more possible positions , which ends the following command menu , so that you can choose the right position :
with del@@ eting either from the menu bar under Edit or from the context menu of the right mouse button , you can choose from selected objects from the scene .
if you have changed qualities , click on User to take these changes . if you have entered inv@@ alid values , a message is displayed with an error description . then you can click the input error and again on users or change the changes .
if you enter the path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation in the dialog box , you can use the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help .
you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL user documentation to use this property . if this documentation is not included in your distribution you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 contains the user documentation .
if you work a texture or a part of a texture , you can view a preview of Fe@@ at@@ ography View .
press preview in the self @-@ image view and a small example of the scene is made with the chosen texture . if you want to have one part of texture ( for example a texture within a texture Map and not the whole texture Map ) , cross to local .
the screenshot shows the control points of the camera . you can pull this control points with the mouse and change the position and direction of the camera .
if a transformation is chosen , the control points and it will display a small cross in the wire @-@ line view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for p@@ ush@@ es . you can change the shift by pulling with the mouse within the entire window .
each object has a wire level of line level . you can only specify this value relative to the visibility level or as absolute value . objects are displayed only if they are selected or equal to the visibility of sight of the scene .
&amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; has a window order as a default setting . the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
if you don &apos;t want to save the standard window order , or if you need another arrangement , you can save them . you can also save several window orders and switch between different regulations .
to an@@ ew a window over or below a view , enter the Anf@@ asser to the upper or lower edge of a view . a rectangle shows the new position .
in order to generate a new column , enter the Anf@@ asser to the right or left side of a view . the new view is an@@ cho@@ red at the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height .
if you would like to arrange multiple views on each other , enter the Anf@@ asser in the middle of a different view . you can then change between the views by clicking on the map cards top in the views .
the last possible window order are pending views : views , which are not an@@ cho@@ red in the main window . to solve a view from the sl@@ ender , take the initial arrow onto the working area or click on the small arrow pointing at the bottom line .
to close a view , click on the small cross in the Anf@@ al bar . to prevent the closing , click on the small square between arrow and cross .
you can add additional views to the main window . in the menu View , you can find entries for any type of views . new views are floating , you can an@@ cho@@ red them in any job .
the current window view , you can store with view window order ... save . it is displayed a dialogue in which you can store the window order under an existing or new name .
if you have a scene , you can ren@@ ch them . &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; used &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g to ren@@ ders , this program needs to be installed properly . as this hand@@ book was written &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 currently . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; version 1.0 does not support .
to ren@@ ver the current scene , click the Symbol Ren@@ ders icon in the tool@@ bar or select the menu entry view .
a R@@ ender mode con@@ forms to entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determin@@ es the image size and quality of ren@@ ders . if you want to insert a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can add many R@@ ender modes , from a fast preview to high quality images in highest quality .
if you click on the symbol The R@@ ender settings in the tool@@ bar or in the menu View R@@ ender modes ... choose the following dialog :
each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can choose any name , but it &apos;s a name that lets you recognize the characteristics of the mode .
in the box card size you can enter the width and height of the picture in the picture . if you want only a small section of the image , select the check box and enter the image section to ren@@ ders in the input fields .
in combination with quality , you can choose the properties tab , the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; for ren@@ ders . this goes from a very simple colour and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user Refle@@ ction lighting . a detailed description of the R@@ ender characteristics can be found in the user manual &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ;
if a picture is drawn up with only one beam each . these pictures often have a mo@@ ir@@ è samples or stud effects in curves and lines , sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; used a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing , to reduce the influence of this mistake . generally images with this feature is better .
if you turn off anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and connects &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than a beam per pixel . this technique is called super @-@ sampling .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as standard is an adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive because each pixel is still divided and adap@@ tive because each pixel is still divided and adap@@ tive because each pixel is dependent on the calculated color values .
if you select the first method , POV @-@ Ray passes a beam each . if the difference between the shades of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you want to adjust the default value to 4 , a grid of 4x4 will be calculated additionally , at a depth of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixels , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then :
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 beams per pixel . if the difference between the color values , then the pixel is divided into 4 sub@@ pixels , which can be used individually and tested on a further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of records can be set to the depth .
another possibility to reduce ali@@ asing effect is the generation of noise for the beam process , called J@@ itter@@ ing . if you switch j@@ itter@@ ing , changes &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the beams around a tiny amount , to avoid regular pattern .
the last setting for the quality of the ren@@ der@@ ns is diffuse reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the diffuse light reflection are calculated . it takes a very long to calculate a scene with this feature .
on this cardboard card you can adjust whether the alpha channels are calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent if the corresponding rays have no object .
opens a new window for displaying the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ counter issue . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ exp@@ ec@@ tedly , you can find the reason for this .
to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; select the menu entry into import@@ ing ... and select a file in the dialog window .
currently supports &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; nor does not occur the complete command of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; when import@@ ing error messages or war@@ nings , a dialog window shows a list of messages .
if you don &apos;t support source text in &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; write this spring text between the two special comments / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ end .
you can extract objects from object tree into the editor to export the source text for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; this includes the source text editor into the scene file . in order to import objects in the scene file and drag it into the object tree .
with copying and insert in &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; and in your editor , you can also insert sources for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ;
the POV @-@ Ray command is called if &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; a scene usually is p@@ ov@@ ray or x @-@ p@@ ov@@ ray .
if you click on the self @-@ image view , Open &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation to the displayed object . set here the path to your document and the version . supported versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; sear@@ ches after external files ( for example , al@@ ti@@ dd@@ ata ) in the path to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; libraries . if you refer files to these files , you must also use the path to these files here . if a file comes in different path of the library , the first found file is used .
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying the selected objects .
the color for control points . the second color is used for displaying the selected control points .
the colour of the rectangle for the visual field in the camera view and in the Window Type mark .
you can adjust the object of points on the grid in the context menu of the wire @-@ menu views . you can set the grid separately for sliding , sc@@ aling and shooting .
larger values result in a more accurate wire model and therefore a better nails for the shown objects , but require more time to ren@@ ders . for some objects such as the sphere can be set to the detailed level for two directions .
if you cross the highly detailed projec@@ tions for extended projec@@ tions , all the wire model is used , all projec@@ tions are used , with excep@@ tions from perspective and per@@ formers . this feature provides a better approach for projec@@ tions , but requires more time to ren@@ ders .
when you cross a wall display a wall behind the objects . the wall is shown in a chess bre@@ tt@@ ps of two adjustable colours .
when you indicate the soil , a soil is under the objects . the floor is shown in a chess bre@@ tt@@ ps of two adjustable colours .
if you dis@@ able the edge of the scenes , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method for the ren@@ ders of scenes can be used . the values for depth and vibration value can be adjusted . more information on parameters you will find in section R@@ ender modes .
on this page you can change the existing window orders or create new window regulations . in the window s@@ akes section is explained , as you can create window orders and store them .
the combination field of standard window order : displays all existing win@@ dow@@ els . &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; used the selected window order in the start of the program .
the list of revised windows orders show all existing win@@ dow@@ els . a new arrangement allows you to create and delete a selected arrangement with the button .
every window order is identified by the name . the name must be clear and may not be empty .
the list below shows all views of the selected window order . new views can be created with the button and remove select Vie@@ ws on the button Remove .
the position of the new window . with new column you create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with card card you can see a map postcard view together with the previous image , but creates a separate window in the main window , but it creates a separate window .
so you have just &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; installed and now you want to start without more accurate knowledge of the two programs . if you &apos;re able to create all the steps in this guide , you should be able to create the ultimate but easy scene with beg@@ inner : a ball on one level .
but you should carefully consider the following war@@ nings before you should make sure that you use as a result only a black screen . if you use a 3D program for the first time you should consider this important rules :
if you don &apos;t set any camera , no rules can be applied for the ren@@ ders , as a result , you can get a black image .
if you insert no light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you will get a black image .
if you have all installed in@@ correctly , you can see at the first start of &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; the following default window order :
take a little time to know the menus and the existing symbols of the tool@@ bar . read the documentation , so you can get a reasonable performance that you can expect from this program .
you will need to use this menus and symbols now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and also their applications .
&amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; starts with a simple scene . in order to follow these instructions , you need to remove all objects from object tree . mark the scene and then select the menu entry to edit . so you have a scene without objects .
the wire @-@ line view shows how the camera shows the whole scene that you create . in particular , you can notice the scene from the scene from the view of the camera . this is showing the outcome of the scene from the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the designation camera . if you click on it , see the contents of the view object properties , where the various parameters of the camera will find . in the user documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; you will find further details .
change nothing to the basic settings of the camera , this is later reserved , but note that the camera has changed in view control points , with which you can change the target point of the camera . just click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired place .
if you press the button to press or the entran@@ ces , the wire model Vie@@ ws and the object tree immediately change these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the view@@ point of the camera .
there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . for example , you could add a Qu@@ ader ( inser@@ ting the body Qu@@ ader ) and the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a comprehen@@ sible method to solution this task .
&amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; offers actually a simpler way . you can use an infinite level as the floor :
a good advice : select the level in object tree , change the name and press the button User or the entran@@ ces . in the object tree , the new name will be displayed immediately .
the wire model shows now also shows the plain , although at the moment only a limited level . if you ren@@ aissance the scene , the level up to the horiz@@ on .
if you can see the object tree exactly , you will find the entry for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . select one of these options , change the possible settings in the view of the object properties .
in this scene you should shift the soil to exercise a unit under the horizontal line , just so you want to know some of these parameters . choose the shift and set the values as follows :
select the floor only to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose a little bit Easy .
in both cases a dialog , where you can choose to select how the object is to be inserted . please select the name in the propri@@ etary image ( name = bottom pigment ) , with a click on the button preview it looks like the pigment now .
of course , the preview of pigments only shows a matte black material because you can download the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview . now there are many ways you can now , but take the eas@@ iest way .
if you are looking in preview no color on qu@@ ader and sphere , click on the user button and then call the preview .
the material for the floor is right now . if you are now with a click on the symbol , you should get the following result :
of course , this is not the colour ben@@ ds . here you need to set two new attributes ( you can do this entry ) . then you can do this entry twice ( you can do this also more frequently , but the chess boards can be used only with two colors ) :
in object tree every time , select the colors in the object of object properties :
this step , you should already run , as you should understand the basic working method of &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; the ball is just as easy as the ground :
in the view of the object properties you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius . otherwise , the ball rot@@ ates contact with the ground . otherwise the sphere would be pump@@ ed over the floor , as you would have post@@ pon@@ ed the soil to a unit down@@ wards .
of course , the ren@@ ders now yields a rare result : as already before , the ball surface appears like a matt black material . set in the following step a suitable material .
if you have selected the ball , you can now add a material now . as at the bottom , give the ball a pigment as color :
choose First sub@@ object and change the name for example in sphere pigment . Click on ball pigment , then select one @-@ colour and set the values as follows :
but you can achieve even more interesting effects , if you take the time to set some finish properties :
then change the values as in the following screen photos and click on users or press the entran@@ ces .
the brightness of shine effect and reflection are already partly good visual effects , perfect for glass or chrome surfaces , even if metal is not selected :
you should now have a good impression that provides you &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; and hop@@ efully you have learned so much , that you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ gen is a R@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional scene of a three @-@ dimensional scene or one model .
if you have a scene ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ing , the ren@@ ders hypo@@ thet@@ ical R@@ ays from the view of the viewer . the R@@ ender is calculated , such as this beam is reflected in the scene , and like atmospheric effects of light sources , such as fog . so the scene pixel is processed for pixels .
as you can imagine , you will see without a camera , the camera is your eye , with which you can see the scene . without a light source , it is simply black . obviously , any scene needs to be rendered , some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
open a file . in the default file dialog you can select a file which you have previously prepared with &amp; p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ;
whenever you open a new model or create , the file is inserted into this sub@@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you have already saved the model , it is stored under the same name . if it is a new file , you have to enter a name and storage space .
represents the scene in the last saved version . all changes have been rejected since the last storage .
this menu entry can only select if you have not saved any changes in the scene .
repeatedly rec@@ er@@ ated command . this menu entry can only be selected if you use the Edit menu .
saves the current window order and opens a dialogue in which you can enter a name for a new arrangement or an existing arrangement .
in this menu , you will find options for setting &amp; p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; here you can change the look , the keyboard lid and the default behavior .
opens a dialog for changing the keyboard ab@@ brevi@@ ation . you can change the command line for &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; add commands or add new .
opens a dialog for setting up the tool bar . you can add to this option tool@@ symbols for &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; add commands and remove .
a B@@ ump @-@ Map is a possibility to custom@@ ize rough surfaces without any fer@@ ves on the surface individually and without changing the geomet@@ rical form of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file both for B@@ ump @-@ Map as well as for a texture Map .
basic body are simple geomet@@ rical forms which you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these fundamental body . these models are then processed to give them a realistic look .
a texture Map is a possibility to give the surface of an object color to pixel basis , by application of a image file as color card .
&amp; sk@@ ill@@ show ; is a comfortable image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser , where you can choose pictures for displaying .
pictures can be displayed in a window in size of the image or in full screen mode .
the usage of &amp; sk@@ ill@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files to view you with clicking on the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or button return .
you can adjust whether each picture is displayed in a window , or if any images should always use the same window .
if you are searching for a certain file , simply type the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame in the browser window . if a matching fil@@ en@@ ame is found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c ; .
in dialogue with &amp; sk@@ ill@@ show ; there are five cardboard cards . available in three of them , General and processing and sli@@ deshow that can be set up in the two others , short command for the display windows and short commands for the browser , the keyboard pins can be set for the respective window .
if this is selected , then the pictures will be opened in full screen mode . if the picture is not big enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area is filled with the background color , which you can continue below . default is not full screen mode .
this point is activated , load &amp; lev@@ ard show ; already the next image in the folder while you can still view the current picture . this reduces the delay if you choose the next image , and is especially suitable for sli@@ deshow .
with this option saves &amp; sk@@ ill@@ show ; at the end of the opened folder . at the next start &amp; kick show ; this folder opens in the browser window .
Click on the colored bar to select a background color . if in the window mode the window is larger than the picture , it is also filled with the selected color here .
you can order &amp; ku@@ k show ; so that only some of the file types can be displayed , which can also display the program .

in the scope of exposure , you can choose the color that is displayed , if the sub@@ - or over@@ exposure dict@@ ator should be selected , what you should show , in contrast , a bright color and over@@ lay a dark color should display .
the main window of &amp; entertainment photo ; possesses a side panel on the right edge , which provides important information and actions to the selected pictures . you can also view this page in the image processing . you can view this in which you can click on one of the five riders :
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is an application to scan scan , which does not make any more images to scan and retri@@ eve pictures .
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is an easy application to scan and retri@@ eve images . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; can be opened to store a dialog or save the images in a specified folder with automatically generated name and format . the user can also display the pictures before the store .
you can check the status of your scanner at the s@@ ane repository . enter the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ s@@ ane @-@ pro@@ ject@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ p@@ l .
a standard scanner can be set at the command line of &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; if this scanner can &apos;t be opened if the scanner is not open or if there is no standard scanner is opened , then a dialog for selecting the scanner will be opened .
the user can select the scanner and press OK to open the scanner and stopping the scanner .
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) do not have these options especially .
in order to get a picture , the user can start a p@@ aus@@ can and then look out scanning area for the final scan . the scanning can be started by preview @-@ button .
in order to select the picture to select the user into the image and out of the current selection , it can also adjust the zoom that the complete preview in the window fits .
if the image has been selected , the final picture can be read with the scan button .
if before saving a preview is selected in the settings , then the picture is displayed in a screening window , as shown below is displayed , then the image will be stored and sh@@ y ? EN leads to a demol@@ ition and you will return to the main window .
due to the button settings , the ep@@ onymous dialog will open before the main window . you can change the main settings here .
the user can consider the picture , if desired , before saving . in this case , the option should be selected before saving a preview . if this preview is not desired , then the option must be selected .
this setting allows you to select the type such as &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; images can open the dialog for any picture open the dialog . if &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite , you will open automatically with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you will need to ask without any file names .
this setting defines the pictures at option to store without any file names . if the images are stored for any scan , then this folder will be used as default for the Save . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button ...
this parameter defines a picture pre@@ fix for the images to save pictures and is also stored on the proposed name for the image in the dialog . automatically saved a num@@ eric view@@ ix of the same time when a picture is stored . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
the user can custom@@ ize the image quality output . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if select the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used .

you can possibly use existing Multimedia buttons so that they work as &amp; am@@ arok ; make your keyboard to the &amp; am@@ arok ; Control Center .
the D@@ COP @-@ Interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions which are mostly seen in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts , and should describe the D@@ COP functions of collection , context @-@ browser , player , play@@ list , play@@ list and scripts . a sample call for the D@@ COP function could be pause &amp; z@@ b ; like this :
Amar@@ ok supports command line options of Q@@ t and K@@ DE ; in addition Amar@@ ok has some own command line options .
you should give the user a feedback if the script may not be executed because of a lack of depend@@ ency . please check if all the modules are present and use the dialog , so that the user does not run a script .
Beg@@ in Requ@@ ire &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE binding for ruby ) from k@@ de@@ binding V@@ 3.4 is Requ@@ ired for this script . &apos; &apos; dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos;
in the folder scripts / templates you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use it as a basis for your own scripts , or simply use the required functions . you will quickly determine that the writing of scripts is relatively easy .
using D@@ COP , your scripts can be exchanged with Amar@@ ok and Amar@@ ok . the sim@@ pl@@ est way is the use of the command d@@ co@@ p ; which should increase every K@@ DE installation .
most scripts allow to execute external programs and commands . this is usually the function ex@@ ec ( ) . in this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; is relatively easy to be called . here , an example in Python :
&amp; am@@ arok ; sends alerts on all running scripts . for this reason , scripts will continue to monitor their standard awarding certificates and respond to the events . of course , a script may also ign@@ ore the events when it has no use .
configure the script to display the settings dialog . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok has started the folder where all data should be stored on the folder where all data should be stored .
track@@ change uses that a new piece is used . the script may now ask &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ COP functions further information on the new piece ( for example the met@@ ad@@ ata or the unit length ) .
volume Change new@@ Volume signals a change of volume . the new volume is an integer between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ ize menu entries to the selected entry list , if a user @-@ defined menu entry , if a user @-@ defined menu entry can also be used to remove the D@@ COP @-@ function d@@ co@@ p am@@ arok ( sub@@ menu menu ) , if a user @-@ defined menu entry is used to remove d@@ co@@ p am@@ arok ( Sub@@ menu Men@@ u@@ Item ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) .
before &amp; am@@ arok ; termin@@ ate , or if the user stops a script , sends the signal SIG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed for example . it belongs to the store of data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ oks script may also install script packages that can be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ t@@ ar ) , which can also be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ t@@ ar ) that can be optionally seen with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ t@@ ar ) that the user can clearly recognize the archive as Amar@@ ok script package .
&amp; am@@ arok ; 1.3 will accept only script packages with the expanded amar@@ isk script . from this reason , you should set your script packages equal right .
the main plan must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameters -@@ p to receive the file rights :
if your script will be finished , you can download it on www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and hang up the link to the Wik@@ i scripts site by &amp; am@@ arok . on your entry to K@@ DE @-@ apps you should use the category Office ; scripts .
&amp; am@@ arok ; is an audio player for &amp; K@@ DE ; it &apos;s a lot of useful and powerful features and is still sur@@ prisingly easy to use .
with &amp; am@@ arok ; you can simply run music into the play@@ list instead of endless menus . perhaps you may also search for a certain title from thousands of thousands in your collection . with &amp; am@@ arok ; &apos;s Colle@@ ct browser and the quick search will be found within seconds .
maybe you already have some play@@ lists , but you could never choose what you want to hear ? then , the play@@ list browser is exactly the right for you . and if you are still difficult , select dynamic mode and intelligent play@@ list automatically , select the right music after certain criteria .
Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers , i@@ Ri@@ vers and many more useful features provide Amar@@ ok to the most advanced audio player . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and sh@@ ick - just the right to re@@ discover your music !
usually , in the base of the Amar@@ ok @-@ sources you need to comp@@ ile the following to comp@@ ile Amar@@ ok and install :
da &amp; am@@ arok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake , you should have no difficulty in the comp@@ ile . if you encounter any problems , please report these in the &amp; K@@ DE ; mail@@ ing@@ lists .
&amp; Hear@@ ken , has like most applications some options that you can activate or de@@ activate the configure date using the configure options . this is a list of available options .
certain depend@@ encies must be fulfilled for some of the compilation options , so that they may be used . details can be found in the system requirements .
activ@@ ating Deb@@ ug@@ ging Symbols , you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help in the development of &amp; am@@ arok , you should use full use .
&amp; Hear@@ ken , can be set up without trouble about the alignment dialog . the dialog box has several mapping maps to set up the various functions of &amp; am@@ arok ;
player window displays the player window , in addition to play@@ list , or out . when the option is off , only the play@@ list window will be displayed .
voting barometer : this function is only available when &amp; am@@ arok was compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . the option switches the experimental function of the tuning unit .
tuning of the tuning : this function is only available when &amp; am@@ nesty ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar , the used color scheme for the voting activity is changed .
set the tuning files in the music files : this function is only available when &amp; am@@ arok is compiled . if this setting is enabled , .@@ Edit files in the settings folder by &amp; am@@ arok ; saved ( normally ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / am@@ arok / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) .
external Browser : lets you choose which browser of &amp; am@@ arok are to be launched if a browser is needed .
use other browsers : here you can specify the path to another browser that cannot be found in the list .
to save play@@ list , the current play@@ list will automatically store the current play@@ list , when you want to lose the current play@@ list if you don &apos;t want to lose the current play@@ list .
relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : if you activate this setting , &amp; am@@ arok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the storage location of the play@@ list , otherwise the absolute position of music files will be stored .
the piece of piece should be visible , that the play@@ list window will hold - / off , to keep the invisible window in the visible window range .
in order to change the context @-@ browser , automatically changes the context @-@ browser , once the next piece is all@@ ud@@ ed .
in the Section of Image , you can adapt &amp; am@@ arok ; s appearance is custom@@ ary . the section is divided into three parts .
in the font section , you can select the use of different fonts in &amp; am@@ arok . you can select fonts for the following area : play@@ list windows , player windows and context @-@ browser . if you can choose a desired font from the selection dialog .
with the selection of custom color scheme , you can define the qu@@ al of your choice and can define their own color scheme . use the lower color settings for front and background color .
playback at the start , that &amp; am@@ arok ; after the program start , playback automatically with the piece on the spot , with which they stopped at the last end .
the sub@@ window on @-@ screen display allows you to set the inser@@ tion of the O@@ SD . if On @-@ screen display , a preview of O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview .
the first option is the font . Click on ... to select from the dialog for the O@@ SD . the check box sh@@ adows that the text is sh@@ aded in the O@@ SD .
your own colors gives you the possibility to adjust the O@@ SD colors for writing and background . one click on colour areas opens the dialog box . if your own colors is not enabled , the pre @-@ set &amp; K@@ DE color is used .
the input field display text is displayed in the O@@ SD . by using plac@@ eholders , O@@ SD can be adjusted to the own needs . below is a list of available plac@@ eholder and what they mean .
the monitor screen is intended for X@@ in@@ ama users . you can set up the O@@ SD screen on which screen will appear on the screen .
the box card audio output lets you select a audio driver from the selection box . some drivers are able to activate further configuration options in this map card .
the card collection is used to set all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and the type of database for the collection .
here you can select the folder , select &amp; Sh@@ arok ; according to music files , select the check box in addition to his name . this section includes check@@ boxes to set how to set the selected folders .
sub @-@ folders : this causes &amp; am@@ nesty ; both the crossed as well as their sub@@ folder to music is well as well .
changes : enables you to monitor the selected folders to monitor the selected folders ( e.g. music files or deleted ) . furthermore , an incre@@ mental search is carried out to determine the necessary modifications to your collection .
import@@ ing play@@ lists : causes &amp; am@@ arok ; all found play@@ lists were added in your collection folder ( .@@ pl@@ s and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists appear later in the play@@ list browser .
the part collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the combination field driver : can be selected between SQ@@ Lite or MySQL . if MySQL is selected , another establishment in the sub @-@ window MySQL setup needed .
the MySQL institution is used to set the database for &amp; am@@ arok . under calcul@@ ator , the calcul@@ ator is set on which the MySQL database is entered , under which the database is accessible . name : is the database name , which the connection is manufactured .
use user name : and password : to enter the data collected for the connection to the database .

&amp; am@@ arok ; is a audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . further information can be found in the Sum@@ mary of functions and gallery with screen photos .
am@@ aro@@ K requires only the package K@@ deli@@ bs and else no other K@@ DE packages . you need to have K@@ deli@@ bs so installed ( including the programs contained , because &amp; am@@ arok ; requires some of them to compiled for example modules or scripts ) . we have a small guide on how to add K@@ deli@@ bs minimal .
some features such as the O@@ SD require that your window manager keeps the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org , but Flu@@ x@@ box will work on all platforms . we are trying to support am@@ aro@@ K on all platforms , therefore we use K@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , because these are able to provide excellent development environment .
probably , one of your files will show an error in the Tag@@ Li@@ b library for days . you can see this error to the Tag@@ Li@@ b developers under bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de.@@ org and hang it also the kap@@ ut@@ te file which caused the crash . afterwards , you can delete the file and let the collection .
mostly this is that Tag@@ li@@ b at reading the met@@ a @-@ information from this file system crashing : please report this error to the Tag@@ Li@@ b developers under bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de.@@ org .
if you use MySQL as a database , then try SQ@@ Lite . support for this in &amp; am@@ arok ; is a bit more mature .
make sure all of the &amp; am@@ nesty ; used libraries have been compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if e.g. &amp; am@@ arok ; with GCC 3.4 , Tag@@ Li@@ b , but with GCC 3.@@ 3.x , this leads to crash when editing the met@@ a information .
if you use K@@ DE with art@@ s@@ d , then dis@@ able automatic mode when in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or use at least no value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ log of e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail opens automatically at a crash ) . if there is an often open crash and send us a good back@@ log , then the error is guaranteed .
this is due to write a lot of program data as UTF @-@ 8 into the met@@ a @-@ information but it is not known as Unicode character . the following Perl script fixes the problem .
# ! / us@@ r / bin / Perl won the &quot; file $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : Mp@@ lib@@ - &gt; new ( $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ) ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ MP@@ 3- &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; error in writing of tags of $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; &quot; $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; U@@ TF@@ 8 ) ;

to fix this error , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ di@@ ating Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ conf so that am@@ aro@@ K first finds the right version first .
there are some possibilities . most of the installation problems clari@@ fy yourself at the help of any experts or Linux distribution . you can also use help for other users or developers . use it for the forum and the I@@ RC under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ en@@ ode@@ .net at Channel # am@@ arok .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please only bear an error if there is something at the accommodation of an error in am@@ aro@@ ah itself .
after the start of &amp; am@@ arok ; appears only a blank play@@ list . how do music pieces have come in ?
this is simple . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files into the right part of the play@@ list .
to keep the surface intu@@ iti@@ vely , the start window was converted into the statistic window . you can find it under ex@@ tras &apos;s statistics .
the importance of this symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars are standing for the evaluation by the user , while the points will be calculated automatically .
to evaluate pieces , the evaluation box must be displayed in the play@@ list . Click on the title track column and select column . Click here to set the evaluation command Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is located in the background .
select the files you want to remove , and press it on your keyboard . or click on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your selection and then select from playback menu .
drag a play@@ list file with the mouse into the play@@ list and let them fall there , just as you would like to make it with other files , just like it is : - )
in the tool bar , the play@@ list , directly next to the button , is the button play@@ list . Click on it .
presumably the program X@@ M@@ MS @-@ config . install the X@@ M@@ MS @-@ config package . install the package X@@ M@@ MS @-@ dev@@ el and install &amp; am@@ arok . watch also after lib@@ visual , this package includes many very nice visu@@ al@@ izations .

no . Yes , that is true ! no ! &amp; am@@ arok ; uses a back@@ end independent approach , therefore the actual question must support G@@ stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / O / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you see , we support such a memor@@ able audio format . G@@ stre@@ amer can even support text and P@@ NG de@@ coding !
it may be ! perhaps use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , where default is no MP3 decoder or supplied ( from patented legal reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 K@@ DE , inclusion

if you use the G@@ stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa @-@ S@@ ink device to use the device to use the same time . this can be achieved using a sound card using hardware mixer ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( Software @-@ Mi@@ xer ) . check out the help of the help D@@ mix for AL@@ SA .
the issue of this command should help you with the problem in search of problem and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer you need to specify another sink ( e.g. oss@@ sink ) .
it &apos;s doing &amp; am@@ arok ; already . don &apos;t forget that media must first be de@@ coded for most people . G@@ stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ coded them and sends the PCM data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
also X@@ M@@ MS de@@ coded data first . G@@ stre@@ amer can output directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open sound server with highest priority ( real time ) and increase the size of sound buffer ( warning , see next point of FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ ra@@ pper is set :
with K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE@@ Multimedia Co@@ dec@@ s , which can cause distur@@ bed playback . read this mistake report . the Enlarge of Sound Pu@@ ff@@ ers in your AL@@ SA configuration file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help .
either do not use the Arts driver , but instead G@@ stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE @-@ Multimedia completely to get the faster Arts Co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc . ) .
probably use the Arts Dri@@ vers . if you have a different driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been optimized for Analy@@ zer ) , or reduce the size of the buffer buffer in the control centre and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . depending on the buffer , the less applications react to visu@@ al@@ izations . Yes , that &apos;s a mistake , please help us to fix it .
G@@ stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to change the G@@ stre@@ amer driver , cr@@ ashes &amp; Order . why ?
after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer you need to register all components . lead @-@ register to register all G@@ stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that helps not , you can also ask yourself in the I@@ RC channel # g@@ stre@@ amer .
try this ( end you am@@ aro@@ que before ! ) : - Download the m@@ peg file , comp@@ ile and install it . delete the module folder with g@@ st @-@ config / g@@ stre@@ amer config ( you can find the module folder with g@@ st @-@ config / g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run @-@ register .

&amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; is how many other &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ applications also equipped with a &amp; D@@ COP ; interface also equipped with the help of these interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled via a sh@@ ell@@ ar .
to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; functions , you can either use the command line d@@ co@@ p , or the somewhat more comfortable to use program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are crucial in the functional scope , so it &apos;s rather your taste and the kind of tasks crucial , which the programs you will give .
in this chapter , we assume that you can use the command line d@@ co@@ p . to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; functions you have to make sure that &amp; K@@ 3@@ b . then , give something like the following in the console :
in addition to the general &amp; D@@ COP ; functions , all &amp; K@@ DE ; program common , supports &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts are described below .

as a result such a cre@@ at@@ e@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method you can use a D@@ COP reference to the newly developed project : # K@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project by using # d@@ co@@ p K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project by using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Pro@@ ject@@ interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the top listed K@@ 3@@ b@@ Pro@@ ject@@ interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Pro@@ ject@@ interface , which can only be used on data @-@ projects ( CD and DVD ) :

&amp; audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; is a audio CD ; it &apos;s easy to read audio CD ; s read and stored in MP@@ 3- or OGG files . other sizes are possible , depending on the encoder of the computer is installed .
&amp; audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( comp@@ ress &amp; CD files on the hard drive ) and of many co@@ di@@ ers ( comp@@ ress this WAV files must be installed from the Linux distribution ) . further Ko@@ di@@ ers can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first the titles of the &amp; CD ; read and stored in WAV files on the computer ( loss@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step , this WAV files ( normally one per title ) will be compressed into the MP@@ 3- or OGG format or other formats like the loss@@ less FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not installed , it must now be done now .
for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ ging up ( for OGG ) or other Ko@@ di@@ ers have already been installed , so it is not necessary to comp@@ ile any Linux distri@@ butions , but if FLA@@ C is not used , its installation is not necessary .
which encoding / file format should be used ? the chapter Which Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction of Ko@@ di@@ ers , audio quality and compression factors .
a word for copying audio CD ; s : as already said , uses &amp; audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia , for reading the audio data from the &amp; CD ; it is not possible to read any copy protection . in any case , &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; even don &apos;t avoid the mechanisms of copy protection . avoid the purchase of copy protected audio CD ; s !
while setting up only once has to be made ( the configuration dialog can be found as often called up to a suitable configuration ) , the daily handling of a &amp; CD is explained . this leads ( hop@@ efully ) for understanding the slim approach of the user interface , which you will be proud of the beginning often .
can convert many formats - depending on which Co@@ aster programs are installed ( MP3 , OGG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can get &amp; CD ; get information from the Free@@ DB file from the Internet or can be complete without network , whereby everything is recorded manually .
this is only a short list of commands of the master window . on the page step by step example , further information , such as this program is used as well as screen photos with descriptions of the program cards for the configuration of the program .
k@@ icks off the CD@@ DB file of the CD data according to the device map of CD@@ DB . ( this may be locally or online , in the latter case , first must be manufactured to the Internet . )
start reading and - if a encoder is configured in the tab chart Co@@ di@@ zation Settings - the coding .
a sub @-@ menu opens with a list of available encoder , so that the selection of other encoder can be read as the standard . it is too note that previously the encoder input settings dialog has been configured .
opens the file manager , so that a file would be selected to en@@ code rather than a complete &amp; CD ; read and add @-@ out .
opens the configuration dialog to configure the type of alerts ( such as protocols , pi@@ ep@@ sen ) for program events ( like reading the &amp; CD ; finished ) .
opens the main setting dialog of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; with different cardboard cards ( such as Encoder , to set the En@@ co@@ ders ) . this way you must go before the program can be used successfully !
this chapter describes audio quality , body and compression rates and helps you choose the right Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers choice .
if no audio information is to be lost , a loss@@ less audio format is needed . besides FLA@@ C there are others like &apos; sh@@ orts &apos; or &apos; Monkey &apos; which may be available for these distribution . the dis@@ advantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files .
among the audio formats , you lose information through data compression according to their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and OGG is the most common . OGG mag is a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but the differences are less important , since both co@@ ders are very good audio quality .
O &apos;@@ Not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is supplied with most distri@@ butions free , but there are open licence questions
+ high up to very high sound quality ( at high bit rates ) , but compared to OGG slightly deeper quality at lower rates .
OGG - if only music is one of the computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG @-@ playing devices are available .
MP3 - if music is also owned on other devices such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special car stereo systems . today - early 2009 - support these devices usually only the MP3 format .
a short list of parameters to audio quality and resulting compression ratios for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency of most people and most of music
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer most people and most music pieces of acceptable transparency , and has already high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set Extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . requires up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and somewhat less for less complex parts of the product . good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . needs 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a tit@@ els . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR joint stereo , compression rate approximately 11 . 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a tit@@ els . good enough for music from adolescents , portable devices and auto@@ test@@ oster@@ one plants . but not good enough for better fi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set ins@@ ane &apos; = 320@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting is ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated for most people and most environments absolutely ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated , but if you absolutely do the absolutely highest quality , without view to the file size , then select this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information , manually entered or via the program automatically via the Internet , are available as a list of parameters . it can be used as a list of parameters . it can be used with &amp; audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; and to create the file name as well as the characteristics of music files .
in connection with Ko@@ di@@ er@@ programs there is often a combination of program settings for the co@@ aster and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the co@@ di@@ ers explain the switch for these programs .
for example to add the &amp; CD ; title to the keywords ( English : day ) if MP@@ 3s with l@@ ame is encoded , the switch -@@ tt of l@@ ame and the title parameters of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator must be added ; the result looks as follows : &apos; ... -@@ tt { Stop } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; parameters that can be used ( = button designation in the assistant ) :
this is what the Free@@ DB file is : a free database , in which persons can read the audio CDs , the information can be downloaded , so that all other these information can be downloaded from here : &amp; CD ; titles , artists , names of the pieces &amp; etc . , not from the audio file itself .
Yes , it should be legal , but I &apos;m not lawyer . however , nobody can prevent or get information on the &amp; CD ; however , nobody can prevent any information on the &amp; CD ; but all the information can be done by a &amp; CD ; business , physi@@ cally or virtual .
in &amp; audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; it is active to choose a check box ( sending an address ) . in this type of configuration , it seems that the e @-@ mail address will not be used when the server is not used ( This can only know the programmer that has the code . )
in many countries , copies of the main database . if &amp; c@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator , the ge@@ ographic will be used to use Free@@ DB ; this saves bandwidth in the network and resem@@ bles the load between the computers .
a visit to Fri@@ ed@@ b.@@ org provides a current list of mirror ver@@ n for online demand of &amp; CD ; information during reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which reading program is used to store pieces from the &amp; CD ; to save WAV files on my computer ?
there is rum@@ or that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used to search in the source code .... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD ; s. to note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package from the appropriate distribution must be installed first if this is not yet done .
for saving the stored WAV files , the co@@ aster and that the desired file format can be selected . during the first opening are the pre@@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a loss@@ less compression for audio data ) . other co@@ ders can be added on this tab .
the Ko@@ di@@ erer package must be installed from the respective Linux distribution prior to the co@@ aster . this is also necessary for the pre@@ defined Ko@@ di@@ ers . more information about Ko@@ di@@ ers are in chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
after installing a Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers more information about his switches can be obtained through the input of a command like l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . it must be replaced by the name of the installed Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers .
this may have many causes . check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , writing and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia as well as the audio co@@ aster of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs ) . try to retri@@ eve both programs with a command line in a terminal . this could give a note that which is wrong .
check if you don &apos;t want to read a copy protected audio CD ; check the shell of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
there is a chapter by step by step example . even if you use other settings , this tips can be submitted to how to proceed .
if you read the complete manual , everything understood but som@@ eh@@ ow are still un@@ certain what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will prepare enough information to create those areas that you want to make the program exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time , everything is set up and our first &amp; CD ; we &apos;ll be able to create MP@@ 3s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 sample words ( tags ) .
there must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be installed as a pre @-@ compiled package for your Linux distribution as it is not necessary to comp@@ ile the source files , which you can always do .
please make sure that the directory / us@@ r / share / cd is made and that you own write permission ( eg ; try to copy with the cross @-@ section ) .
the first section deals with basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; something which is probably only done once and
the second section describes the approach to read a &amp; CD ; what needs to be repeated for any out &amp; CD ;
here we determine the data compression of music ( l@@ ame ) and audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting audio quality ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting audio quality ( MP3 ) as well as the audio format ( MP3 ) as well as we are la@@ zy to use the program to download the Free@@ DB file to download the &amp; CD ; download data from the Internet .
although we can change these settings anytime , we &apos;ll be very likely to read on any reading of a &amp; CD ; if once the matching settings are found .
the device name will be handed over to the reading program to read the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces .
frequently , / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your drive . if this is not working or if more than a &amp; CD ; / DVD drive can also be accessed using existing entries , such as / etc / f@@ rod and an attempt to download existing entries for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the map controller General settings . here it &apos;s not much to do . here , an additional conversion will be defined . in our example , everything will be bel@@ low as shown in the screen photo .
only For in@@ complete information may be found , so that you will be informed when data is missing ( tags ) .
the ticket card CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically download via the Internet from a Free@@ DB computer .
note : the calcul@@ ator must be connected during the reading of the &amp; CD ; connected to the Internet , so that it can access to the Free@@ DB server .
the second selection box is simpler , a &amp; CD ; entry is found immediately , if you are later un@@ satisfied with the database entry and the fil@@ en@@ ame or fil@@ en@@ ame files can be easily changed . the directory and fil@@ en@@ ame is changed , and the ID3 Tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; K@@ DE ; tag@@ ger .
apart from this example , if you want to enter all manually , the selection fields and Free@@ DB file would not be used . however , you can select the database fields . however , you can select Free@@ DB in off @-@ line mode , at least the first selection criteria must be selected , at least the first . the mode is set up on the following card card .
CD@@ DB is for us Free@@ DB . these are settings for the retri@@ eve of the &amp; CD ; information from Free@@ DB server on the Internet . how to know the system which data can get the CD ? read the section about Free@@ DB . do all such as shown in the screen photo .
mode : we don &apos;t have downloaded the database , we want to work only with the remote database on the Internet Server .
CD@@ DB server : please go to page fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org and looking to a mirror server in your vicinity . on this way the load between the computers will be distributed as the first attempt .
both will function equivalent to the server , as much as many fire@@ walls exist the protocol 88@@ 80 standard , maybe more luck with the protocol 80 , as the &amp; HTTP ; protocol usually is open to surf on the Internet .
in this example , we want to transfer any &amp; CD ; data to the Free@@ DB server . the first check box should be enough .
simply take the settings of screenshot . ( make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer )
number of simultaneous pieces : ap@@ ologies , is there a reason why more than one at the same time when using only one existing drive ? parallel reading and en@@ code ? the author knows not so easy to try .
CD ; after reading the latest pieces : take this to the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process .
custom files for temporary files : if you can present this folder , then the path / folders can be stored in which the WAV files can be stored . if you don &apos;t have space on another drive , you will not forget that folder if you want to make something with the WAV files .
everything is as shown on the screenshot . the command is somewhat long , under circumstances require something to the right and to see everything .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set Extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of MP@@ 3s . as previously mentioned , this is a very good audio quality , even for very good HiFi stereo systems . it &apos;s a good balance factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and storage consumption .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for the limitation of production of tags on version V1 . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag@@ ger for &amp; K@@ DE ; in case of subsequent modifications of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the names of the inputs ( including the complete path ) and the output file ( including the complete path ) .
use the rest as in the screen photo . some comments for future use outside of this example :
number of simultaneous WAV files : with a Du@@ al@@ core or Quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine can be tried to en@@ code more than a WAV file simultaneously .
this is what we have just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; this configuration will be used as standard for any reading of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organis@@ ational structure of your music , you &apos;ll never need them to change .
this section is described as the process of the reading of the &amp; CD ; we will be able to create files on the hard disk . first , we will be able to recover files on the hard disk . first , we will be able to recover files from the Free@@ DB file . the process of which is described in this section has to be repeated for any out &amp; CD ;
since we have a &amp; CD ; the screen photos are not included a little different than those for a &amp; CD ; with successfully supported by Free@@ DB files . hence , you will learn the &amp; CD ; data are manually entered , instead of using the Internet . comments are displayed on the differences .
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this manual .
if this has not been done , now the &amp; CD has to be defined in the drive which has been defined in the main window .
after a short moment , pieces and its length should be listed in the window as shown in the screen . this only if the &amp; CD ; as audio CD ; identified and can be read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this is not done , you are looking for questions and answers after the help or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings .
attention : if the &amp; CD ; successfully used by the Free@@ DB file , all titles of the pieces are already completed and in addition , the name of the artist and the album will be shown .
for the case that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; key to your &amp; CD ; there will be a window embedded , and you can choose the database entry , which your opinion is best on your &amp; CD ;
if you don &apos;t have the check box for the automatic query of Free@@ DB ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings dialog for Settings ) , you can also solve this manually by choosing the first an@@ op@@ fs in the tool@@ bar . if you pick no local database , but you need the connection to the Internet .
E 1.2 Step 02 : the CD @-@ Editor - input of CD data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen photo . the title of the piece in the first row of the input field &apos; Update &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; .
the artist must not be entered in the input field &apos; Update title &apos; unless you have an arrangement with different artists for each piece .
the lower comment field can be used for the individual comments of ini@@ di@@ ally per piece , the commentary box of the album is used for comments on all the pieces of the CD .
attention : after successful retri@@ eval of data from the Free@@ DB file , the CD editor is not empty , but it does not only have a good idea to start the content of the CD player ( e.g. whether all words with major letters or not ... ) , but also to check whether there is any undes@@ ired remarks .
note : in this example we use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this is limited to the length of the fields on 30 signs for the artists , album and title of a piece and only 28 characters . this option is set up on the tab tab . take a look in the section &apos; basic settings &apos; .
you can change the day information of the generated files later at any time with the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with him you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
tags will not be supported by all co@@ di@@ ers or file formats . see also in the help of Ko@@ di@@ erer to get more information .
just choose an entry , obviously with the style of the extended CD ; in this example , this is not important , since we do not exceed the &amp; CD ; read the information about the categories . pop or R@@ ap for example are under sk@@ irt .
after the election of &apos; OK &apos; you come back to the main window . Click on the line with the second piece .
the window of the CD @-@ Ed@@ itors appears again and you see that the fields for the album has already been filled with the specified data , which we wish for the first piece . enter the title of the item in any case and other information you wish .
Click on the next row in the main window and process in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD ;
attention : this window appears not when you have downloaded the data from the Free@@ DB file . it is already sorted into one of these categories .
it is the third button of the tool bar . note that the artist and the album will appear on the list of the list .
note that there is a check @-@ in before each line of a piece . only the titles are selected , or use the button All pieces select the bottom edge of the screen to select all the pieces at once .
by clicking on the button selection of the reading process , this window appears to confirm . on OK , then we will take a look at the window with entries and track what is running .
Click on a rider to turn off on the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the tool@@ bar .
this is the window on control of orders . the first piece is currently read on the hard drive . the status of the program is displayed in the lower part of the window in the status line .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this error message you will see if you are trying to work with a co@@ aster which you have not installed yet . if they have not been encoded with a red &apos; X &apos; in the list list . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the target folder are not what we have entered here in example . have you checked if you have a write access to the folder for the temporary files and the target folder ? ; - )
now it is clear that the error occurred immediately after the end of the reading of the first place .
the order 1 reads the first piece of which he is finished . but we have completed a new entry : this is the coding of pieces 1 into the format MP3 . thus we read and coding parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has no configuration settings to read and en@@ code the number of parallel processes . with high @-@ weak machines , the calcul@@ ator with an AM@@ D@@ 64 seems to have no problem with simultaneous evaluation and en@@ code ( of however two different pieces ) .
now the last title is read , while another piece is coded , and a third order is encoded in the qu@@ eu@@ e &apos;s qu@@ eu@@ e . after the last piece is coded , a small window will be embedded in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; c@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; you need &amp; K@@ DE ; 3.@@ x@@ . / 4.x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to generate compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG , you need the Ko@@ di@@ ers of your choice .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; if you have already known a pre @-@ compiled package , as &amp; c@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator , you can download from there an anonymous copy here . if you want to consult a anonymous copy there . if you read this package you have already done this package you have probably already done it ...
this section is aimed at people who comp@@ ile the source files , and not intended for users to use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are searching for assistance according to your needs , if it runs once , it is the following correctly for you :
a program that calls for many different programs , has many variations of settings . on the best , read the step by step example to know the options and settings . it shows screen photos of different map cards of the settings and also contains comments for options which are not used in the example .
hello , still on reading ? even if only the help menu was attached after the initial start of the program , no audio CD ( especially if at the time of program starts no audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from the un@@ usually short menu ?
what &apos;s it ? who reads this , probably the program started . it should look something like this :
a bad example : unfortunately no e @-@ mail . the author can &apos;t stop this manual . it is the first version for a manual to &amp; audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; let &apos;s do it . if you want to read and read this section . and if you read this section , he has under@@ gone this section and is therefore agree with this suggest@@ ion .
strange if you managed to get the source file from &amp; K@@ DE ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need these information , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MID@@ I@@ - and Kar@@ a@@ ok@@ esp@@ er of &amp; K@@ DE ; . besides others , he has some features with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ aoke @-@ real show collection of texts also some features , the other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players don &apos;t have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; K@@ DE ; it also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ as@@ ound projectors , which is required for G@@ US cards . Al@@ sa is supported . Al@@ sa is supported .
&amp; k@@ mid ; shows the song text on the screen with changing color , so it is easy to follow the piece .
graphical display of the activity of any MIDI channel by using the pressing buttons on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop so that you can pull in &amp; K@@ DE ; any MIDI file from a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window can be moved to K@@ Mid .
supports both existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( son@@ ography items or texts ) .
seat support . if you finish &amp; K@@ DE ; end of playing a song , K@@ Mid starts again with the same song again .
supports external MIDI syn@@ thesizer , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US card ( for the latter , you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can open ... from the menu file . it appears the usual file dialog , with whose help you can choose the desired song .
you can also drop a file from a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; window will fall into the &amp; k@@ mid ; window will also work with several songs simultaneously .
to play a music piece , open it and confirm the button playing in the tool@@ bar , select the entry check out of the menu piece , or confirm the empty button .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; one piece will start automatically , as soon as you go on the &amp; k@@ mid ; windows . ( with multiple pieces are added to a collection and played in succession . )
once &amp; k@@ mid ; one piece plays , you can jump on any spot by using the middle button of the mouse and drive to the kno@@ b .
if you find that a song can be played quickly or slowly , you can click on the arrows to turn left and on the right of the speed . to get the original speed , double click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the Le@@ ert@@ t@@ aste has two tasks : if one piece is played , a pressure on the Le@@ aders is played as a pressure on the bed@@ side or the exit of the menu entry to the menu , so the play button is played during a single piece , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback .
lyrics can be saved on two ways in one piece of music . some pieces use Tex@@ ter@@ eig@@ nis , others use lyrics and again others . some pieces have no text : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can set what the events will be displayed , and even better : the event type will be selected , so that you can select nothing manually . if you want to select the kar@@ aoke text , but you still have the possibility to change this if you want to see the other way .
if you want to adjust a event type , select from the menu settings the entries text messages or lean experiences . the same function also have keys 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files which you can summar@@ ize , these will be played through the series . in this section , how you can use the collections .
to create a collection , open the collection manager . this can be found in the menu collection under the point .... Click on New and enter the name for the collection .
you can also copy a existing collection by clicking on copying and then specify the name for the new collection . this collection will include the same songs like the original .
if you have more than a collection , you can set up the set@@ ups on a collection manager .
in the temporary collection , all songs you want to add to any other collection .
when leaving the application , this collection is not saved . consider the if you add many pieces .
to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in collecting manager . there you can add to a song . there is again the file dialog , with whose help you can choose the desired song .
a second method to add a song , depends on the attitude Automatic add to the collection .
if automatic add to the collection is activated , a piece of opening ( using file opening or drag &amp; drop ) is automatically added to the active collection .
if automatic add @-@ on to the collection is not enabled , when opening a piece set the temporary collection , then the collection will then be added to the collection .
to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and select the desired song and then click button .
you can select the order where the songs are played . if you select the series after the sub@@ menu sequence of the menus collections , the songs are played in the order , as they added to the collection .
if you add songs or remove or acci@@ dental order in the menu , the order will be set .
to play a song , select it in collecting manager , or use the selection list above the kar@@ aoke text .
to jump to a song , select the button next song , the entry next song from the menu piece or press the arrow right .
to jump to a song , select the kno@@ b piece , the entry pre @-@ piece one from the menu of the menu or press the arrow on the left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection , and click the button Del@@ ete .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , it doesn &apos;t matter when leaving &amp; k@@ mid ; not stored .
this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thes@@ izers , which are non @-@ MIDI @-@ compatible . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map General @-@ MIDI events that under@@ stands the syn@@ thesizer .
for example , you can create a MIDI map that converts all the change of the Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the Change Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et and thus always a trumpet sn@@ ares if originally a piano should play .
if you only have a sound card , you don &apos;t need MIDI @-@ Map because all sound cards GM are compatible ( including A@@ we - and G@@ US maps , FM @-@ devices and so on ) .
sorry , there is no programs to create MIDI @-@ Maps . you need to edit the appropriate file from hand ( with your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI @-@ Map is a text file , which stores all required documents for playing a unit .
each section may appear only once , except the KE@@ Y@@ MAP section , which is so often appear as desired . the requirement for this is , however , that every occurr@@ ence has different text ID ( see below ) .
De@@ fine P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MAP &quot; Name of Key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D De@@ fine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... EN@@ D options ... EN@@ D ...
you see that de@@ ph@@ ins is needed to view that a section begins ( except for options ) and EN@@ D , that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your Map file as an e @-@ mail , so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can not be compatible for devices that are non @-@ MIDI compatible .
in this section , the patch of General MIDI is shown on your specific keyboard . the general use looks as follows :
please note that the left side of the same sign is ig@@ no@@ red . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the right order ( from 0 to 127 ) , you may not change the order and also no line for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M will be used to insert all sounds that supports this instrument with number M ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with tone 60 ) that can take you similar to the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP section .
for example , if a MIDI file is to play a note with Patch 127 ( ri@@ f@@ le ) , it takes a patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the tone 60 , independent of which sound is in the MIDI file .
please note that here with the term drum patch of patch , if any sound is a different per@@ verse instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ als , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc . ) , and not one that means the sound height of the same drum means ( like him some keyboards ) .
KE@@ Y@@ MAP section is needed to specify such as tones on a specific channel or instrument . the use is :
like the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the order of lines is very important , as well as their presence . you need to create 128 entries .
you can define multiple Key@@ boards for each channel and you need to use several devices only in the first row .
in particular , Key@@ boards will be used to finish sounds on the per@@ verse channel . check out as an example the supplied Key@@ boards .
this section can be used to transfer some channels to others . if you want to exchange , if you want to exchange the first and second channel , take advantage of the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP -@@ section .
however , these settings are useful for keyboards on a specific channel ( General MIDI to Channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , built according to the following pattern :
n is the channel , which is depicted on the Channel N . if you use the key@@ map option , the Key@@ map will continue to change all events that try to change the patch on this channel . in this case , patch is then used patch x .
the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful to use the Per@@ kus@@ sions @-@ Patch on the per@@ verse channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch Ben@@ der rati@@ o are multiplied , in which proportion of Pit@@ ch Ben@@ der events can be multiplied by the value n , this is used with the formula n * ( r / 4096 ) and then re@@ directed to the value of 4096 , so that in the map file is no dec@@ imal number ) .
this setting is needed because GM is presenting a keyboard , which is a pit@@ ch Ben@@ der event to play a tone higher . unfortunately , some key@@ boards will be playing for two tones up to one oc@@ tave higher . in order to try the right value on your keyboard , you have to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid .
to use an MIDI map , just open the MIDI settings dialog . you can find this in the menu under settings , point MIDI settings
the channel view is a window with a wide range of cla@@ vi@@ atures ( one for each MIDI channel ) . you can see that sounds are just played .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . if you have changed an instrument , the button is not changed green but red , to view that no more the original instrument is used .
the channel view has ( until now ) two different views to view the played tones . you can choose the menu settings under the point channel view : settings
the pace @-@ LCD displays the speed , with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
you can change the pace of a song . if you find it , a song is too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the pace , use arrows to the left and right from the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file which contains information about how a music piece has to be played . it contains the notes , rhythm , speed , &amp; etc ; so it can lead the same MIDI file on two different devices , as well as two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways .
well , I can never comp@@ el to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while a mp3 @-@ file needs a similar sound quality . with a MIDI file , you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc . you have the control of everything .
that can happen if you compiled a binder distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) of &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support , you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos;s home )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add any files separately .
understood , therefore supports &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . just open the folder you want to add in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; select all files from , and drag it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window .
previously , activate the attitude of automatic add to the collection . otherwise , files are added to the temporary collection .
you can double the arrow on the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow down the playback . to restore the default temp@@ o you can double to the LCD .
I have played on a &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ window with my MIDI file and &amp; k@@ mid ; if I want to play a MIDI file ( if I want to play a MIDI file ) or if I want to play a file , only in the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window will change and drag the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid ;
if you want to listen to a file without taking them directly to a collection , switch the setup Automatic add to the collection , and the new ; file will add to the temporary collection . opening files
let &apos;s take you to play the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mi@@ d. , just want to play the first file . thus , set the setting automatic add to the collection and open up to A.@@ mi@@ d. your temporary collection then contains exactly these a MIDI file .
then you can connect , also B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection of all three files . how do you do that ?
these people have sent me MIDI files or postcards . all the thank you ! when I see these songs or see the postcard , animated me on &amp; k@@ mid ; to program .

the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there are always the window with the central view . there &apos;s a window with the play@@ list . and finally there is a information window that will be displayed only if information is recovered .
it is possible to use the preferred connections under the menu book@@ marks , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that can be played after each other , then you should use the category continuous play@@ list .
of course , you can add groups to groups to receive an additional Hier@@ Archi@@ est@@ u@@ fe . if you have an entry , its group and all its sub@@ sets are copied to the current category and play it with the attached entry .
the categories &apos; current pieces &apos; , television and continuous play@@ list can also be changed by a editor , but can also be changed by a editor , but also through the application itself . for example , the different files can choose from the menu View and the next processing mode . by clicking on a sub @-@ group , only the XML content will be displayed by this part .
after changing XML files , you have to choose from the menu with play@@ list and choose either the processing mode , or select a different category .
all changes are lost if the working mode is left or a different group will be selected without any play@@ list .
as a result of the convenience of the author of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; some features can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files .
the animation at starting and editing can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c and change from &#91; General Options &#93; No in@@ tro = 0 ob@@ iger option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not available , it can be simply inserted .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; will be files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / file .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
animation at the start does not need to be short , it will be terminated automatically by opening a different source . this would be at the end @-@ animation , however , the user can stop the application a second time .

there is a rider to configuration of M@@ Player in the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; here , the path of the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data flow from the network and other things can be set .
another tool for troub@@ les@@ hooting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of k@@ m@@ player . here is the issue of m@@ apped .
there is no rider for this ren@@ dition in the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; everything must be configured by manual editing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c . here is an example how a &apos; flash &apos; is played with the squ@@ e@@ eze @-@ Mozilla with the module :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; it can even be inserted the special field @-@ bed for YouTube in play@@ list .
in order to play the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages , the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; module must be specified as a service provider for the M@@ ime type application / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash in the configuration dialog boxes of K@@ DE .
the con@@ quer@@ or or &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is in a consoles application form and to error messages regarding the loading of the browser module library . if no error occur here , the back@@ end issue within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) .
that is always a pre@@ defined baking for a certain M@@ ime type ( of course only if this was also determined ) , this must be done by manual change of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c . for example , phon@@ on should play all og@@ g files :
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; may play TV cards , either by using M@@ Player or X@@ video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be configured to use the used device and TV channels . this can be used manually from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually .
for configur@@ ing V@@ DR ( video data rec@@ orders ) Settings in the k@@ m@@ player , the dialog box can be found in the settings under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . you should be found out of which one will be selected . to re@@ use encoding ( e.g. it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably contain a DVB .
as the V@@ DR support of k@@ m@@ player can only use X@@ video ( probably the only works only ) . this is also supported on the first screen ( : 0.0 ) . for this reason , the video@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension has to be functional for the X server . it is therefore necessary to be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X11 / XF@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig . ) .
internally used by KM@@ Player for the sources different names . at the time of the emergence of this documentation , these dv@@ d@@ are source , source source , source source , source source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . if it is enabled , they start playing play@@ list .
are there reasons how I can turn out my CD@@ ROM drive when I don &apos;t play from it ( not of the VCD : / / ) ?
Yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ e 8 / dev / c@@ drom is used as user root according to the device . it is absolutely sure to make / dev / c@@ drom on the CD@@ ROM drive .
X@@ ine only starts slowly , why must my CPU be tested upon their performance ?
note : the answer is over@@ hau@@ . k@@ x@@ ine@@ player automatically needs the last saved value , only the first time will examine x@@ ine the CPU .

Dal@@ y , A Guide to &amp; Lat@@ ex ; : Document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Users , 3rd Edition , 1999 d@@ af@@ Ã ¼ r .
the same as other expres@@ sions includes &amp; Lat@@ ex ; an introduction , with which the gener@@ alized properties like paper format , page number@@ ing and text gr@@ illed with the command \ \ Beg@@ in { Document } and must be closed with the command \ \ Beg@@ in { Document } and must be closed again with the command \ \ \ { Document } .
the quick @-@ level assistant of &amp; k@@ ile ; is a great function for the fast creation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; the selection of the documentation . it can also be made some of the document related to the document .
document classes : this will be the way to create document documents : articles ( German ) , book &#91; info &#93; , letter &#91; letter &#93; , article ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , report ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ er@@ pr@@ t &#93; , projector &#91; be@@ amer &#93; , slides &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or custom .
coding : this will be configured the string coding . it should be used to use UTF @-@ 8 encoding as standard . if necessary , UTF @-@ 8x should be used ( for correct processing of &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used additive for &amp; lat@@ ex ; for mounting the attachment them only in the check box .
article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to compliance with German DIN rules ) . you should always use the preparation of German texts .
new users can now be wor@@ ried anymore . only a short description of functions and further information are given in the section .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers - same as other source editors used in the screen . by &amp; k@@ ile ; there is a simple problem @-@ looking texts , settings and elements ( as well as the impossible ) is not closed . however , it is still noted by the modest appearance of the output file . however , you will be able to save you by Her@@ vor@@ de Time and Sil@@ esia .
with the automatic completion of the environments ( e.g. \ \ Beg@@ in { command } ) of &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically creates a idle line to connect the text ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be de@@ activated in the program settings ; set @-@ in ... La@@ Te@@ X commands are disabled .
all documents are usually divided into some elements . &amp; Lat@@ ex ; encourage the sub@@ division of the document in the following items ( part is the whole and sub@@ jective element ) :
with the view of the document in the structural view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a single mouse click on the respective section .
when creating your own &amp; Lat@@ ex ; files can be very helpful , as soon as a DVI ; file &#91; straight file &#93; has been created , jumps &amp; k@@ ile ; by one click with the middle mouse button in DVI ; -@@ viewing the corresponding line in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code .
a DVI ; file contains a description of the format document and also other information as the font , and is besides PDF the information output type of &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; there are many tools to view , conversion and printing from DVI ; -@@ files for different systems and devices .
when using the R@@ Ã ¼ r@@ ts@@ man , the elements of the DVI ; file can be clicked on an element in the DVI ; file , it is clicked on a section in the &amp; Lat@@ ex ; source code is shown on the corresponding passage in DVI ; -@@ viewing spec@@ ations .
Master @-@ Document : this function will be used at work with several files . with a Master Document , the work is simplified with other integrated .@@ tex files . when using a project a project can be set to project project settings .
fast : the &amp; Lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( unless any errors found in the spring text ) .
file recovery : in this mode , the DVI ; file is based on the cr@@ us@@ eless â , and it is not a call from &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; following the quick construction .
in consideration of the Edit tool@@ bar , the three large @-@ scale selection fields should be developed into the document . the first selection box is designed for fast casting of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... The available fin@@ alized &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands for sub@@ division are :
the selection box is similar to the items of articles such as keywords , joints , or references . the options are :
name : this command will be used for a section , a picture or different element .
reference : is used for reference to a specified name ( selection of a selection box ) .
when using quote , a selection list with literary entries will be displayed . for the editing of &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; and the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files are also written in &amp; styles ; they are written by hand .
the last selection box with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ e is used for the definition of the font , the font , which will be specified on the main text , the joints , etc. are specified .
at the call of &amp; k@@ ile ; two selection criteria for the creation : 1 . the assistant for the creation of a new document by selecting the document and determination of the settings . 2 . the document may be written down by hand .
the brackets according to the command \ \ docum@@ ent@@ class contain the settings for the command . setting the text &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; specifies the font . if the font is not specified at the beginning , this can also be done in the text .
as soon as the above mentioned source example , the &amp; Lat@@ ex ; source code must be compiled . the sim@@ pl@@ est way to this is the use of the construction of building or the button .
the source code must be stored in front of comp@@ ile . &amp; k@@ ile ; for storing the storage is automatically created .
the compilation of the document should be sought after errors in the protocols . when using quick construction , the ey@@ epi@@ ece should be started automatically . if it is not the case , the log should also be considered .
a environment ( English environment ) is a text that will be treated differently than the remaining document . for example , the command \ \ Beg@@ in { environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ end { environment ) is to have a different font by the font in the environment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prot@@ ected &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( English Hu@@ ge ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the interests are only permitted within the vicinity ( of \ \ Beg@@ in { environment } until \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no decision type ( number ) for free changes within a environment .
there are many denom@@ inations for an increase of read@@ ability and us@@ ability of the document . for example , certain fonts , fat printing , cran@@ ks , etc . these commands are either using the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ Beg@@ in { reception } : this command is closed for short , until he is closed with a \ \ end { reception } or another environment . a single word in a set can be displayed with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ Qu@@ ote : created a quote in document . the quote begins with \ \ Beg@@ in { quot@@ a } and ends with \ \ end { Qu@@ ote } .
after the background to writing the source text with the &amp; Lat@@ ex ; recording language , a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; k@@ ile ;
as soon as the assistant , a little text was entered , a few adjustment for the better read@@ ability of the document should be done . this should be a quote , a few jobs in the fat and curve printing and a po@@ em to the application to see the differences of these commands .
once the document was viewed , it can be returned to editor or C@@ tr@@ l Editor ( at the internal viewer ) . at an external viewing , the window must be closed .
once the DVI ; file created , the document can be printed or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file can be converted . simply try and fun .
DVI ; is a comfortable file format ( English D e V ice I n@@ d. ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi Edition as printer , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF conversion or computer screens .
for printing a &amp; DVI ; file the same steps as for the compilation of the document ( see ) . on the 7th step - after clicking on DVI , the document can be printed using the file ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the conversion bar code displays the conversion of DVI ; file into other formats . once the DVI ; file from the &amp; Lat@@ ex ; -@@ Source can be created , the conversion can begin to recover different formats using the buttons in the tool@@ bar .
the detailed search for the direct jump from the editor to da@@ w@@ ed position within the DVI ; -@@ file .
&amp; k@@ ile ; provides a corresponding attitude for all &amp; lat@@ ex files ; for this purpose , only Modern under Settings can be set up ... tools of building views .
in order to be able to adjust the mouse , the mouse has to be positioned in a row of the source text and then connect to the background . the jump to the corresponding point in DVI ; viewer is then so@@ ber .
using this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; document the corresponding &amp; Lat@@ ex ; document the corresponding &amp; Lat@@ ex ; document the corresponding &amp; Lat@@ ex ; document must be specified in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; used in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; used as text editor ( settings ... Editor )
if the use of quick construction of the &amp; DVI ; viewer cannot be displayed , an error should lie . should this error be displayed in the log file or in the message window .
the log file extension refers to the error source in the source text . in the editor , the log file can always be clicked on the error . in order to consider the faul@@ ty line . in order to be clicked on the error in the protocols , jumps &amp; k@@ ile ; jumps to the error line .
once you clicked on the respective button in the tool@@ bar , a window appears to choose the template for the document .
when selecting the empty document a document can be used either from the reason to new or the assistant to the fast creation of a new document . further information are included in the section .
basic users of &amp; Lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be created in &amp; styles ; created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / Lat@@ ex ; file can be created or create a new file using the existing document and selection of file template from document .
when creating a new document by a new document , some character labels will be replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set in settings ... settings can be submitted .
in creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know what character labels will be replaced by which variables :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ TC@@ LA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ : this character string is replaced by entering the document class . typically they are using document class : \ \ docum@@ ent@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ A@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ &#93; { 4 } .
the sim@@ pl@@ est way to create a template is the use of the assist@@ ants and the therefore associated entry of the commands in Editor . once the document was created in this way , the following steps can be completed :
&quot; &quot; &quot; when creating a new document then the own template can be filled instead of the standard equipment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; files will be created . a simple way to create a template should be searched for an internet and the steps described below are described above .
&amp; k@@ ile ; used &amp; Kate ; used as internal editor . &amp; Kate ; is a text editor for programmers of reading and approach of many different types of text files ( including &amp; Lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for &amp; Kate ; can be made directly in the menu of tools directly from &amp; k@@ ile .
to learn more about Kate and Kate ; and his M@@ Ã ¶ ts should be attracted to Kate &apos;s book . users of &amp; k@@ ile , can be found there directly with the reading of the chapter by &amp; Kate ;
&amp; k@@ ile ; provides a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; command conference which can be called for the help of the La@@ Te@@ X Reference , which can be found in &amp; lat@@ ex for almost all commands , which can be found in &amp; lat@@ ex ; used as well as their syntax .
a double click with curved C@@ tr@@ l @-@ button to match the &amp; tex ; meaning that in this way , click on \ \ par \ \ certified sk@@ ip only \ \ par with a full \ \ par \ \ certified \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
when pulling the text with printed lin@@ ker mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to clip@@ board .
when using the dart buttons with curved circum@@ navigation button of the source text in the editorial windows .
&amp; k@@ ile , the m@@ acy has to browse the most diverse types of source texts and these highlighted . for example , the &amp; Lat@@ ex ; commands from the normal text and also the mathematical form@@ ulas are highlighted by another color .
many assist@@ ants are reflected in the text box . this is an own kind of book@@ marks within the text . this is highlighted the jump stamp , so that it will automatically be released during the first input of a character .
the editing is probably one of the main aspect of using a program like &amp; k@@ ile ; even though &amp; Kate ; important functions for the writing of a &amp; Lat@@ ex ; special commands for their selection . under editing the following commands are included in the text choice :
a complete volume ( group of lines that contain on both sides include a blank line ) . this extended meaning has not include tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands and all other lines of the source text . the only bow thing in &amp; k@@ ile , is thereby that the dispatch is separated by two empty lines .
find the word under the current cur@@ sor position . this selection has also a expanded meaning because this command is also &amp; Lat@@ ex ; commands with a red star ( \ \ ) and a free star ( * ) at the end .
for example , a part of the document can be removed natural and it can be removed out of the key . &amp; Kate ; offers the key pendant C@@ tr@@ l ; K with its own commands , it offers a faster speed . under editing the following commands are contained in the text :
removed a complete unit . the definition for a sub@@ section in &amp; k@@ ile ; is contained in the description to Edit menu .
it was already clear that environments is a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore it offers &amp; k@@ ile ; for more commands under Edit environment for easy work with &amp; lat@@ ex ;
with this command , at the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly before the command to open the environment .
with this command will talk to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to connect the environment .
if the cur@@ sor before or within the command \ \ Beg@@ in { environment } is located to the end of the environment talks ( or vice vers@@ a ) .
when entering a lot of pre@@ ach@@ able environmental commands , this command can be lost rapidly . this command was close to the surrounding environment , so that the pre@@ ach@@ able environmental structure is not used .
&amp; k@@ ile ; also special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups that are designed by cl@@ amps ... } are determined . under the Te@@ X Group are some important commands to match the environment .
with this command , at the beginning of the current group convers@@ ations ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the welded cl@@ ams .
with this command , at the end of the current group convers@@ ations ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor will be placed directly behind the welded cl@@ ams .
if the cur@@ sor before or behind the failed wal@@ let at a &amp; tex ; -@@ group # is , the other end of the group convers@@ ations ( or vice vers@@ a ) .
during the input of many missing groups par@@ enth@@ eses , this command can be lost rapidly . this command was close to the fac@@ eted group , so that the sh@@ atter@@ ed structure of the &amp; tex ; groups cannot be used .
in &amp; Lat@@ ex ; two simple instructions for the purpose of purpose is used as well . for the purpose of purpose is used in &amp; styles ; the sign is used for two simple instructions for use . &amp; k@@ ile ; knows this case and for two sleeping signs for &amp; lat@@ ex ; one .
this automatic feeding can be set in use under settings ... La@@ Te@@ X and can be switched off .
it can also be used too short settings ( e.g. n@@ atives or French ) and there@@ with German or fran@@ chise . there are also many other languages available .
during the Shift of Shift . inclusion , an intelligent t@@ line break@@ down . if the current position is located within a lists of environment ( e.g. en@@ um@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , not only one line @-@ up , but at the same time the command \ \ item .
close to a Tab@@ les with \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
even better - &amp; k@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to under@@ line default &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or user @-@ defined environments . this can be added to the La@@ Te@@ X settings ..
some users can arrange the columns in tables environments and all E@@ t @-@ characters ( amp ; ) to each other . &amp; k@@ ile ; try not to be used for example . although this tab@@ ulator is not allowed to add &amp; k@@ ile ; some intermediate space for the columns has been added to the current Tab@@ ul@@ ators .
although &amp; Kate ; already a good source of understanding has been installed in &amp; styles ; for example , these modes have been installed . all these modes are available for various working methods . all these modes can be set up for different working methods .
when you start a new environment using the command \ \ Beg@@ in { surroundings } &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically add the command \ \ end { surroundings } after an empty line ( for the text ) .
when printed , the last letter of the input is removed and m@@ Ã ¶ am , the list can be resi@@ zed by entering a further letters by entering a further letters .
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions are made available , so that a simple jump to these positions can be opened , and the parameters can then be frozen and the parameters can then be frozen .
under settings ; set up ... k@@ ile ; dis@@ able settings of these lists are made . there are different honey@@ comb lists for all &amp; tex ; - &amp; &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands as well as well as the knowledge of the general language use .
the command mode is not to be entered as well as a few letters with \ \ Beg@@ in to be entered and the call of Ver@@ sions mode will be used as often . on the other hand , the environments is so often used that &amp; k@@ ile ; a special mode for expl@@ oring the environments .
when the call of the complete control mode , the command button is automatically folded and it appears \ \ Beg@@ in . after that , the ambient temperature will be automatically shut down and will continue through wires the input button .
after this is completed , the environment will be closed automatically . once &amp; k@@ ile , recognizes that it is a list environment , even a first \ \ item command can be frozen .
under settings ; set up ... k@@ ile ; dis@@ able settings are made to these lists . this mode used the complete list of reference mode for &amp; tex ; - &amp; &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands .
&amp; k@@ ile ; under@@ stand@@ ings user @-@ defined lists of cr@@ abs , which are immediately replaced by l@@ ashing characters . the lists of ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l can contain the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , in which the associated entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included .
for example , the letter L is entered and replaced by the word of complete control mode , the letter L by Alt + Alt Le@@ ert@@ aste , is replaced by the letter L by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
great things are not helpful . however , it was found that many whales are written in a document more than once . thus , &amp; k@@ ile , all of you have already written used .
this mode can be set in the menu settings .. C@@ ile Ver@@ sions can be switched off . here , the tail value can be specified here too .
the complete sample files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ ile / Complete / mode / mode / mode / mode / mode . mode is available for free ( heating ) or tex .
the dialog graph@@ s is designed to create graphics as simple as m@@ Ã ¶ . on the basis of the basis of the basics of the graphics forms the sections should be considered and be considered .
PS files are not so known as PDF files , but offer an outstanding basis for all @-@ learning disabilities and new orders of pages . will be newly arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools are newly arranged and then converted with ps@@ 2@@ pdf into a PDF file .
to comp@@ ose the result of the work , the source code must be compiled . all construction tools are group@@ ed into the program creation comp@@ ile , creating converting and create opinion .
for comp@@ iling the source text for viewing as &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the further conversion can be used by Alt ; 3 , by Alt ; 4 the DVI ; file can be converted to a PS file and by Alt ; 5 the PS file can be viewed .
when using the command quick installation , a viewer is usually called to comp@@ ile . if no one @-@ minded viewer should be used , each time a new window will be opened .
a new project will find out the project New Project .... And the following information is asked for the project :
for the fil@@ en@@ ames of the fil@@ en@@ ame -@@ window sters , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file .
the script function of &amp; k@@ ile ; allows the evaluation of EC@@ MAS@@ TER @-@ Ko@@ de . the scripts can be managed in vertical glue .

&amp; gr@@ it is a graphic editor to manage many different signatures for e @-@ mails ; with the command line interface , you create random signatures or daily signals from a list . these command line interface provides the signatures for external e @-@ mail programs like &amp; k@@ mail .
for random signatures , any signature from the Sign@@ ature file is read and read . by many signatures with different cit@@ ations , styles and information can be varied and unique .
for everyday signatures , the same signature from the Sign@@ ature file of &amp; k@@ sig is read . for each day , use different signatures , such as with acci@@ dental Sign@@ atures , create unique e @-@ mails .
to create a new signature , select C@@ tr@@ l ; N file New . therefore , you will receive an empty signature ; in the bottom section , please send any signature signature ; and add the signature signature ; and add the signature signature , save them with C@@ tr@@ l ; S file Save or click on the disk@@ ette icon .
you can create many signatures . then you have a list of signatures for e @-@ mail programs like &amp; k@@ mail ; if you use e @-@ mails privately or profession@@ ally , there are always sufficient signatures .
to delete a signature , select the first and then remove from the menu file or click the symbol with the Red Cross Remove in the tool@@ bar .
open the dialog box . here you can select a short command for menu entries , select a promotion from the list . Click the right below on the button user and enter the new short course by pressing the button or button combination .

the version 3.2 of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; contains many new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in their integration in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; all these tools use compression as a surface and lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt . the combination is fast , efficient , complete and productive tools .
everyone who worked with the &amp; K@@ DE ; documentation is supposed to do it . if we still give it a piece , we give it a graphic surface ! no more on a terminal , simply click on a terminal ; simply click the symbol for XML processor and ready !
this application expects inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book is located in the ge@@ otechn@@ ical working folder , then leave the current working folder . if not , remove the selection of current working folder and put them in the field of other folder the desired folder .
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML ; files will be deleted every time when my pro@@ c started .
as already said , everyone who has worked on the &amp; K@@ DE ; documentation already worked , knows how useful this application is . and with &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; there is now a great graphical user interface .
if the just opened file inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book , then you can simply select the current working folder . if not , then select the current working folder and enter the folder where inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book is available .
if it comes to a issue on screen , your file is in@@ correct . please check the reported error and try it again .
if the file has already been selected in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; then you can easily delete current file . if not , delete the file using current file and select the file using other file - file selection .
if they only want to know whether the file is well @-@ known , they click the Well @-@ sensitive review .
to use a &amp; D@@ TD , which is stated in &amp; XML ; ( default ) , otherwise &amp; D@@ TD ; ( ES ) and enter the place of &amp; D@@ TD ; file selection . both for the &amp; W@@ 3C ; &amp; XML ; sch@@ ema as well as for the Rel@@ ax@@ NG review , the specification of the defin@@ itions UR@@ I ; is required in the file selection .
Ja@@ probably , &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; also has a &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 library .
if the file is ready to be processed in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; then you can simply select the current file . if not , remove the selection current file and select the file to processed file using the other file selection .
specify the name of the file , how the result is named , the file is normally stored in its home folder .
the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; possibly up to do with &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; even possibly little to do . you can do not wait until someone use the bund@@ led in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the plug @-@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; more about it will find below .
to install a plug@@ in or a K@@ Part , we begin working with the menu plug@@ ins . this will open the following dialog :
this dialog makes all plug@@ ins to manage and new add @-@ ins . we describe each &amp; GUI ; -@@ ELE@@ MENT :
here you can enter the search path . add plug@@ ins without a storage location &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this path to search for plug@@ ins .
often work on a project several people in a kind hierarch@@ ical relationship with each other . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; supports the indication of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 project Project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . Nic@@ kn@@ ame is the case name of the user and serves for unique identification .
a member can have several roles in the project , such as team leaders as well as Sub@@ project leader .
the user can look out from the list of Team Members who is . this is done by taking the team member of the list and the button of s@@ me@@ ar as supp@@ resses . the currently selected member ( its identification ) appears , after which you are : text .
top names and setting of own identity are important regarding messages and comments . see further information about ann@@ ot@@ ations .
besides the overview of her team , there is another advantage through the recording of the members of the team : it can be created an event for information to the team manager if something specific . see for further information .
event actions are actions which are done , if something specific would be done in the project . an example would be seen , or the sending of a message if a file is secured , or a script that appears a file into CV@@ S as soon as they added to the Project &amp; etc ;
on the page event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 project project settings dialog . events can be processed and extingu@@ ished .
an email will be sent to the recipi@@ ents list selected address data . the address sat can be a team or sub @-@ project leader . see , we@@ i such lad@@ der will be set up .
notes are special comments in documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
remarks is simple . it can be found either the note file from the editor @-@ context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation key@@ word in a comment range followed by im@@ aging text .
ann@@ ot@@ ations can be sent a certain member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nickn@@ ame ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( Role ) is a part in the project from the following possibilities : team manager Sub@@ project leaders should be given according to the en@@ rich and sub @-@ project leaders , like in the following examples below .
top names and roles names are independent of large or small equ@@ ation , but spaces del@@ ays the par@@ enth@@ eses and the saying : make the note inv@@ alid .
&amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a development environment for script and form@@ att@@ ing languages supported by D@@ TD @-@ ag@@ nost@@ ic and web @-@ based form@@ ati@@ fying and script languages .
the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here , only about &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found in .
the settings can set the settings by means of Settings ... the settings can be accessed via a few pages which will be treated with each other .
the behaviour of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; regarding tags including car completion can be changed . the entries are :
large / Classi@@ fication of tags : large / small let@@ ting of automatically added tags . normal Groß / small statement means , the tags will be inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
large / Classi@@ fication of At@@ tri@@ bu@@ cks : large / Classi@@ fication of Autom@@ ated At@@ tri@@ butions of Autom@@ ated At@@ tri@@ butions , the attributes are inserted as inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
optional tags : if attached , is optionally available for tags , for which the closing tag is optional , this immediately after &amp; gt ; inserted .
not optional tags : as above for all other tags with the exception of simple tags .
start and end @-@ day automatically update : if enabled , the respective day will be changed and vice vers@@ a .
automatic detection of acc@@ ent sign : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ entu@@ ated characters in the corresponding co@@ coding while placing .
M@@ ime types : Mim@@ et@@ types for detection of different types of files . using button standard , the standard pre@@ set can be recovered .
standard string coding : the coding of newly created or in other way as with file open @-@ open files ( where the encoding of the file can be addressed ) , but this setting can be stretched out by the same in the project properties , if a project is loaded .
standard @-@ D@@ TD : the selected D@@ TD is used for newly created files , or for files whose D@@ TD is not detected , but this setting is now out of the same in the project properties , if a project is loaded .
create a backup copy : &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; created regularly backup copies , such as a power failure or crash in the next start of the program . this is not the same as the storage of the file . also for no stored documents , a backup is regularly used , according to the set time .
the preview and documentation may be displayed in the editorial area or its own view ( or the documentation in a cart@@ il@@ re@@ ite ) which makes it possible to preview the documentation , preview and the source code at the same time .
put the window settings on the default back when the user interface is useful when the user interface has come through to change the MDI @-@ modes and and@@ o@@ ons / depends on views of each other . it complies with the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameter .
the warning messages range serves as the tax of the possibility to dis@@ able the display of war@@ nings by anch@@ ors of no more questions .
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; the display of symbols instead of scripts can be specified as well as the synchron@@ ization behaviour of the V@@ PL@@ - and the Source View in divided mode . regarding the different modes see .
here the Par@@ ser and the structural tree , which represents the picture of the par@@ ser no@@ des in document , will be discontinued in details .
in the mouse click on the structural tree , the following action is possible to change the action with clicking on the structural structure with the mouse buttons .
in the field of structural tree @-@ settings , the visibility of no@@ des can be opened automatically in the tree , the updating of the tree to be set automatically . empty no@@ des are not able to empty the empty areas in the text , while empty groups are not found in the current document .
the area to determine ab@@ brevi@@ ations ( a sort of templates ) which will be un@@ folded in groups , each can be divided into groups , each may be valid for several &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; s . this means it can be a valid group for PHP , which means that the if@@ eline will be valid for Javascript in a group for Javascript .
the plug @-@ ins can be managed by plug@@ ins . plug @-@ ins are the third side , which can be used by any K@@ Part @-@ capable application , most well @-@ known &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; for inser@@ tion of a plug @-@ ins must be specified :
address : the path to plug@@ in if there is not at a standard place like $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / li@@ b .
input : this information is presented to the plug@@ in at the start , so it can open the current file to open the corresponding folders ( path of current file ) or the project folder .
component in &quot; Only @-@ L@@ ese &quot; mode download : check if the plug@@ in is refused to load the loading . only @-@ le@@ ese @-@ cookies normally refused when this option is not selected .
check the plug@@ in : is this activated , then test@@ is &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; if the requested information is correct . if the plug@@ in is not available when the plug@@ in is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later .
this bug was completely re@@ developed for &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from version 3.3 , the error has been completely redesigned . the support for the D@@ BG Deb@@ ug@@ ger . instead , a deb@@ ug@@ ger @-@ plug@@ in concept has been implemented , which enables various implem@@ entations using plug@@ ins .
currently only one plug@@ in available , support for the use of &amp; g@@ ub@@ ed ; in@@ quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ;
the use of the deb@@ ug@@ gers for a project starts with selecting a matching deb@@ ug@@ ger @-@ ins in the project settings . using the options in addition to the deb@@ ug@@ ger @-@ plug@@ in selection field , specific settings can be changed .
if a deb@@ ug@@ ger is enabled , some additional elements appear in the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; user interface :
a view to be displayed in the content of monitored variables . usually in the left dock .
a view , in which all stops , with line numbers and conditions are listed . appears normally in the lower dock .
a view to view the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the deb@@ ug@@ gers . appears normally in the lower dock .
depending on the supported features of the deb@@ ug@@ gers all or part of the following functionality is available .
with this promotion , the connection to the deb@@ ug@@ ger , if necessary , or it divi@@ des the plug@@ in with , on Deb@@ ug@@ ger requirements . this action is triggered by default if a project is opened , which must not be considered normal .
the counter@@ part to de@@ bug session Star@@ te the session . includes the connection to Deb@@ ug@@ ger or termin@@ ates the lu@@ te to the requirements .
sends a HTTP request to server to a de@@ bit request . this is equal to the use of a browser to watch the current document . the issue of this requirement is displayed in the view of deb@@ ug@@ ger issue .
shows the deb@@ ug@@ ger to begin with the execution of the script and the currently specified line . if this happens , while the script is continued , the version is started , the script starts with the requirement .
the deb@@ ug@@ ger has to begin with the execution of the script , without monitored variables and the current Z@@ eil@@ ing number . if this is done , the execution goes further . when a script was given , the version begins , as soon as a request is made .
the deb@@ ug@@ ger leads the next statement in script , without entering the functions or include files .
the deb@@ ug@@ ger leads the next statement in script , whereby when possible in functions and include files .
with Deb@@ ug@@ ger , the deb@@ ug@@ ger to go and proceed to the next , as there would not be the current .

this chapter describes how you can custom@@ ize &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you can adapt to your needs and can help you get better .
document type Ed@@ iting packages ( D@@ T@@ EP ; s ) are used in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; used to provide assistance and flexibility . your simplicity and flexibility makes out &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web@@ developer , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; s are available in two types , family 1 , Mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script files and tool@@ bars ; and Tag@@ XML files are contained in two parts , the tag folders and tool@@ bars ( above the editing window ) , the text and instructions are faster into a document when a user could ever .
&amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing D@@ TD . see for details on conversion .
this document describes how to create Tag@@ XML files , then the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool ben@@ ds . short , one &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ;
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both specific attributes for tags and the content of the Fe@@ at@@ dial@@ og@@ es , the &amp; quantitative information ; for the day shows the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file contains a fast inser@@ tion of tags in a document without a risk of a write .
tag folders are not available as a folder . they contain only the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folders carry the name of writ@@ able language and version , so available . ( for example , html @-@ 4.0@@ 1 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML to and clear whether they are necessary , or not all necessary , it is advis@@ able to use as many as possible , so many users have a better insight and more information regarding the work with them .
the following chapter describes any element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limitations is described in simple way .
this is the root element of an Tag@@ XML document . it can only contain once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags but does not contain anything above itself .
the type of tags is a script function . when using it &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of function . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the day type class . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the Type Method . specifies the name of class to where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
if yes , the day has a common At@@ tri@@ but@@ t group and attributes within this tags can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 )
sets a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; -@@ day . that &apos;s a only element type element .
describes a attri@@ bute a tags . this element can only be noted for each attri@@ bute . it includes further tags that describe how this attri@@ bute is to be displayed &amp; etc ; This is a only element type element .
are the sources used for filling the source code for At@@ tribute in the day editorial dialog and the attri@@ bute tree .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is used to achieve the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of one interface . the d@@ co@@ p methodology name within &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is used to achieve the source of data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , one interface and methodology . the arguments that can be handed over to the method . can be empty or % tag@@ name % , which means name of current tags .
a container tag that collec@@ ts the elements of a list . it is possible to occur for a attri@@ bute description . it is a only element type element .
put the position of the attri@@ bute a tags within a dialog box . this day can only occurs once every attri@@ bute in a dialogue ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; -@@ day ) . the element is empty .
specifies the position and size of a field in dialogue . this day should be available for each field in a dialogue ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this element is empty .
there is a list of elements that may occur within the defin@@ ite tags . this element is a only element type .
there is a list of elements that end a day . this element is a only element type .
all day XML files need to begin with an &amp; XML ; Declaration begin : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be secured and closed .
spaces do nothing influence , but pay attention to &amp; lt ; signs . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; Tool@@ box &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; replaces . this is no leg break , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to check the Tag@@ XML files , the tools dialog in the above &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ window to start and review Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . to select a further dialogue is appear to follow the simple instructions .
this function is currently not available . currently , the check takes only when charging the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; .
in the following an example of a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; sch@@ ema &gt; ELE@@ MENT from the &amp; W@@ 3C ; &amp; XML ; sch@@ ema . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this day XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
in the following an example of a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file , one &amp; PHP ; Excel function is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this day XML file is to be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UTF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; parameter &quot; status = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; string &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt;
the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just fairly simple and there is a editor , accessible via D@@ TD uses D@@ TD settings ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; a simple &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; should be created with the following entries :
&#91; General &#93; version = use 1 for &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for any higher version . name = D@@ TD ( / / D@@ TD HTML 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional ) . if not specified , the name is used as Nic@@ kn@@ ame .
a action can set to set up actions ... to be created . Click on new action to the same dialog :
this action is assigned to the refer@@ ee . with pressing the user @-@ defined user can be assigned a keyboard player ; with K@@ one is the current key pendant .
the sim@@ pl@@ est actions . it can be entered into the detailed settings and displayed this text in the document on the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . using this action you can change external applications ( typically scripts , but it is not limited ) that can change the document or as input ( or parts of the document ) ; yourself are the quick start dialog or the various See in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ T@@ EP@@ s .
the first must be specified as the name of the script and interpre@@ ter . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scri@@ pt@@ .@@ sh .
although qualified paths are permitted , it is recommended to use the % scri@@ pt@@ .@@ sh@@ .@@ In this way : $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ Path There are other special variable that can be used in command line :
% f : we are replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local documentary file will be removed : / from the document name .
% p@@ id : is replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; trial is replaced by &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; only one instance is running , if D@@ COP is used to control the P@@ ID number ; this is useful when D@@ COP is used to control &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; used by the external script .
the parameters for this event , usually the File Name of the current document or the path to project file .
in addition to the above mentioned methods , a script could take a script of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in the selection dialog box can be determined , which is to be sent to the default value . possibilities are :
selected text : the selected section of the document is transmitted to the script . the % input variable is normally just with this attitude .
according to the input , the output of the application can also be re@@ directed . there are two types of issue , to the standard issue ; error messages , which should be done with the default output text , which is set to the value of the selection list :
if there are many tags in Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to create the tags in logical groups . it is necessary to create a specific tool@@ bar . in the case , it is not too many , therefore you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the market .
once a tool bar is added , you must add the actions and configure . choose Settings actions .
the parts of this window are pretty self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the new action button at the bottom end of the window starts the editing mode .
fill out all necessary fields and add the day to the matching tool@@ bar .
complete all , if the day has attributes and you are planning to edit , activate dialogue &quot; day &quot; when available , so that an input when using the action is possible .
Ig@@ itt ! is the ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in conjunction with this icon ? we replace it before we have difficulties .
for creating a symbol no means that the action will be better , we will use &amp; k@@ ic@@ one@@ dit ; select Other Programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) .
&amp; k@@ ic@@ one@@ dit ; used by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size .
please note that the created symbol does not only help you to remember what the action does , but also all other users of the &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ;
with regard to the fact that the day is called , I decided to create a starting button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually interpreted as less , rigid , further interpreted ) , or should , at least , a message will be sign@@ posted on this symbol no more &amp; lt ; starting in the current document .
after the creation of the symbol no means it has to be connected to the action . this happens via the menu with settings ... ( in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; ) and selecting the desired action . next to the text box is a button , press it .
select the folder where the stored icon is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the user button and continue with other tags , so it still gives , or confirm you to complete with OK .
supp@@ ose you want to add some usual &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; functions for tool bar , or should set it to a better overview through several separ@@ ators . open the tool set via settings . make sure that the desired tool@@ bar can be selected .
I would like to choose the separ@@ ators ( top left ) for my tool bar . after selecting the element that should be added to the tool bar , press the arrow button to the right . this adds the element to tool bar .
I want to preview a fast way to access the con@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add to the tool bar .
please note , as the separ@@ ator support group . someone who doesn &apos;t know my tool bar could believe that the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ button is the opposite of the start @-@ button .
the new tool@@ bar must be tested through T@@ ry of all symbols to ensure that everything works .
secure the right folder . after Reb@@ e@@ XML does not exist , it will be stored in the right folder , but your tool bar ( s ) should be loaded in the right folder . please adjust their tool bar ( s ) if a file is opened from the appropriate type .
perhaps the preferred extension of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the script language or the form@@ att@@ ing language which you like to do . this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; document @-@ tree for my personal use .
before you start your own documentation , you could check out &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ itory , whether someone has done this already for you .
there are two parts in this process . first , you need to create a exist@@ ent documentation for the form@@ att@@ ainment / scripts / etc . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . the first part we will be able to treat you the second .
# K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c you = path , relative to this file , for example ph@@ p@@ 42 / # Elements Section 1 = 1.@@ html pages 2 = release 1.@@ html pages 2 = release 2.@@ html tag@@ 1 = tag@@ 1 html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 2@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 2@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 2@@ html
the tree defines the visible part of documentation in the documentation . for example , see in the &amp; PHP ; documentation as something :
# K@@ DE config file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c You = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element Top element = PHP 4.2 Docum@@ entation = Table of Cont@@ ents = Refle@@ x@@ .@@ html ... Language Reference = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = flat synchron@@ ous tax@@ .@@ html ...
note the # before Get@@ ting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . this shows that it is a good place in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the chess table ( except by reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
note that the table of contents directly to a file is refer@@ enced ( and consistent on the upper end of the module &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; file is displayed ! ) .
spaces do nothing influence , but pay attention to &amp; &amp; lt ; sign . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; res@@ our@@ c@@ end@@ at@@ ters will be replaced .
the content section is the area of do@@ cr@@ c file which serves the documentation for the m@@ ys@@ q@@ l _ fet@@ ch _ array _ array of documentation . there are only two types of entries here : the context menu ( Con@@ text List ) and file attach@@ ments .
a simple list of supporting separate context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can save your file do@@ cr@@ c to store up to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / Con@@ anta / doc / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc / Qu@@ anta / doc for local and global use . then create a folder ( as you specified this in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) and copy your HTML documentation there .
if you are sure that these good and it is worth to be shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation were used to be done by the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ community . they are not rich , but are proud to be with the best web @-@ development platform .
with &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the for@@ ged resources ( D@@ T@@ EP packages , tool bar with actions , scripts , templates ) with other parts . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can send an email to friends , partners or else to whom are sent . at different places there will send an email with email , tool bar tool@@ bar with email , in context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts .
the resources can be uploaded to our main archives , from where all other &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ users can be reviewed and only available when our team is checked and made available to sign the resources , for which it is ensured by a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key , both for our team as well as for later users .
while up@@ loading you are asked after their Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase for their private G@@ PG keys ( the Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase will not be saved ) , or in the case that you may have one key . in the dialog New resource , you can continue to stay one . in the dialog box ( URL preview can stay empty ) and with clicking OK it will be started .
up@@ loading can also instantly upload the menus D@@ TD D@@ TD ( D@@ T@@ EP ) tool bar tool bar , and in context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts .
after downloading of a resource , before installation , exam@@ ines &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the integrity of the resource is war@@ ns and it can be lost . if the integrity were given and the resource needs to be signed , a message with the indication of the origin@@ ator of the resource .
it is possible to work on XML languages , which is currently not yet supported by &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; however , it can work tim@@ ely , because hundreds of day files could be needed in tag@@ XML format . there is simpler way to automatically convert a D@@ TD to a D@@ TD package .
the conversion can be started from the menu D@@ TD charging and convert a D@@ TD . select the .@@ dt@@ d file with the D@@ TD description which should be used . afterwards , the following dialog appears :
objective : the newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! doc@@ type defin@@ itions : the string that appear in ! doc@@ type tag such as HTML PU@@ BL@@ IC - / / W@@ 3C / / D@@ TD HTML 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional / / EN h@@ tt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e.@@ dt@@ d should appear
fine adjustment of the D@@ T@@ EP after conversion : if enabled , &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; after conversion the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; Editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; it is recommended to use this possibility .
in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; there are some key concepts that make sure to understand and full use of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this chapter tries to develop exactly these concepts , without their understanding &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; little benefits .
in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the work area is divided into three areas : global , local and projection related . this distinction affects a series of components in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ;
global elements are available for everyone , the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; uses , available as globally , in common stock structure of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; saved . this enables the group of administrators different tool@@ bars , actions and samples in the global tree , which are then available in each user @-@ user environment .
local elements represent a personal collection of web @-@ development agent for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tools . local elements are stored in the user directory , so that they can only use this user personally .
project related elements are only available within a specific project . this can be all done by &amp; CSS ; patterns can be specially designed for the files of a specific project . all elements are stored in the folder &apos;s tree @-@ tree , which is the common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project .
the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ MDI ; consists of some main areas : the editorial windows , the building views , the cart@@ ography with information and tool bar . please beat in , and for further information about these areas .
you can click on the right mouse button to obtain a context menu with the right mouse button , such as close the current , other or of the cardboard , rest@@ art@@ ing or upload the document , jump to a book@@ mark or execution of CV@@ S commands to the current document .
right click in the editorial area lead to a further context menu regarding the processed document ( cut / copy / insert ) , editing the file under the mouse , or open the file under the mouse button a file .
at the top end of the editors , the tool@@ bars of the Ed@@ itors are currently foc@@ ussed , and quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &amp; HTML ; 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional will be shown as a standard , for which a set of tool lines will be displayed . in the course of further expansion of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; they are adapted to the new functions and therefore associated user requirements .
the use of machine ben@@ ds is really easy . if they want to insert it , e.g. &amp; lt ; then you can insert the data for this straight day , then you can insert the data for this straight day . if you want to insert multiple attributes ( like anch@@ ors ) , you can fill in a dialogue with different fields .
the installation views ( Q@@ IT ; ) enable it to open and stre@@ ak in the information about &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for files , project , pattern templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation .
project management is a powerful tool , the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; provided this view shows all files in the project using a right mouse click . actions like adding , remove , upload or del@@ eting the files from storage media can be carried out with the displayed context menu .
a further possibility of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program components , a whole website &amp; etc . there are all options open .
templates can be divided in three categories , depending on which connection it depends . global templates are still available , local templates only for the respective users and templates in projects are available in the project . more to templates are available .
here you can find information on the available script . the concept of integration in Global , Lok@@ al and Project works also here . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can download the available information to a script file , such as the script will be able to edit or send an email .
with this view , one shows the internal structure of the active document . by left @-@ to a Elem@@ entes , the cur@@ sor opens on the position of the Elem@@ entes . by right @-@ clicking a Elem@@ entes opens a list of commands in terms of navigation and view of the tree .
this tree appears among the other buildings . with him , man@@ ag@@ erial At@@ tri@@ butes and Nam@@ esp@@ ace can change the protection of all available attributes with a few clicks .
here is the complete documentation for the web technology for your development . it can be downloaded documentation for &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from the quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; it can create your own documentation , and through adding a folder &apos;s doc to create project @-@ specific documentation .
by default , &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; two cart@@ il@@ re@@ ers at the bottom end of the window that can be reached via the useful information : the message window and the problem window .
this cardboard box shows information about each in Qu@@ anta running script . for instance , e.g. the D@@ TD being used for the current document and all changes to D@@ TD .
this cardboard box shows all the error in the current document . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ scripts that will be executed , give all error messages ( such as there are ) in this window .
the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; tool ben@@ ds are extensive expanded and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and it will receive the corresponding command . the cho@@ ices of the tool bar is the possibility to define own commands as symbols in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ;
a further function of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with email . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; sends the tool@@ bar as a compressed T@@ ar @-@ Archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; you can get them in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; like any other backup and load !
it is reasonable if you want to adjust the place of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; files on your system . this has auto@@ conf a number of options to get to configure options . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and not done here .
if you have problems when starting &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , you should check whether your path contains the &amp; K@@ DE ; 3 am folder . also you should make sure that no older version of &amp; K@@ DE ; 3 in the Path before her bin folders . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t .
&amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; was optimized for rapid web development and combines a fully mature development environment with a wide range of powerful functions .
during an effort to create the best &amp; HTML editor , the developers of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us began to deal with a close idea : what would be if &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; an independent , extended market @-@ up languages ? well , this would make him an absolutely great web development tool for &amp; K@@ DE ; so it was done .
no longer to pure &amp; HTML ; is limited &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . if you can define it &amp; XML , then it should be &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; it should be the suitable &amp; IDE ;
well , at the above mentioned claim must be noted that &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; as product is based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; K@@ DE ; rum@@ our is not only possible , but it allows users and developers , &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; so to enlarge how they need it for their need .
&amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; allows web @-@ developers to enhance the intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface . using self @-@ coated actions , scripts and tool bar can be expanded by means of self @-@ coated promotions . by using self @-@ coated promotions , scripts and tool bar can be possible without any scripts . ( more about it is found in . )
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for rapid web development and quickly expanded into a mature editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is in any way with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the G@@ PL @-@ licensed version and produced a commercial program .

a fast access list of files that you have opened . this list is changed every time when you open a file , which is not situated on it , the oldest entry is taken out .
this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . check in the section regarding templates . should they try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project pre@@ ference folder .
converted from clip@@ board to the special characters to &amp; HTML ; -@@ shots , so that they are correct and not understood from the browser as form@@ att@@ ing instruction .
convert the text from clip@@ board in &amp; URL , which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces . s is primarily used to insert &amp; URL ; s into the anchor @-@ day .
switch the block selection or from . it allows you to select text blocks with the help of the &amp; Shift .

sear@@ ches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a kind of gre@@ p or SE@@ D with GUI and pre@@ defined phr@@ ases to help you .
shows the message window or not . this is the window where you can see the display of scripts and deb@@ ug@@ ger .
drawing and inser@@ tion of the problem in the lower edge of the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main window . the problem is enabled , as soon as to change the structural tree .
shows the tool@@ bar left from the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ mark with a mouse click .
if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will be released in the menu along with the entries prior or next , depending on the position of the cur@@ sor in the document .
book@@ marks from other un@@ opened documents appear in the menu , according to the fil@@ en@@ ames of other documents .
opens a exist@@ ent project from hard drive . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ projects are stored with the extension .@@ web@@ cam@@ j .
a dialog for In@@ sert files into the current project . the selected files are then copied to the project directory .
sear@@ ches the project directory for new files that could be there . this allows you to copy graphics files into your project folder or a sub @-@ folder and then add them to the project .
load files in your project on the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; K@@ DE ; and if you have downloaded additional inputs / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
settings , such as &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the project managed . in chapter &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ projects you will find details .
invites the project tool bar . these will be stored in project you / tool@@ bars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to save your tool bar . allows you to select the type of tool bar : locally or project .
opens a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this means only the name . promotions must be saved via tool bar , or you will be asked if you are asked if you want to save the tool bar .
remov@@ es a tool bar from the visual field . if you are not saved from the hard disk . if you have not saved the tool bar , you will be asked if you want to do it .
you can send their own tool@@ bar at someone ( perhaps at the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; team , so the tool bar is available in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the tool@@ bar as app@@ endix .
enables the up@@ loading of tool aff@@ ord to the main server , where any other can access it . see .

this menu contains a list of tags that are loaded in the currently loaded tool bar . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool bar is loaded , there is in the tags menu , which contains the list of tags / actions in this tool@@ bar .
allows access to the current day settings dialog if there is one . this entry is always available in the menu Tags , followed by &amp; D@@ TD ; -@@ specific sub@@ men@@ ities .
activ@@ ates or disabled the intelligent insert of tags . this is currently working with ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ T@@ Ds . intelligent In@@ sert which means &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ref@@ uses if this day contra@@ dic@@ ated the rules on this place .
in the plug@@ ins menu , the available plug @-@ ins are listed below the top mentioned menu . Click on . click on an activated plug @-@ plug@@ in .
select the syn@@ thes@@ ization mode for the current file . the list of available her@@ edit@@ ary schem@@ ata depends on der@@ k@@ ate ; -@@ Version .
select the type of Z@@ eil@@ ing identification . very useful if you know people who use other OS platforms to develop . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
check the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; D@@ TD ; using external application T@@ id@@ y .
immediate switching between the different types of user interface . by some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , the circuit may need sometimes time or cause un@@ beautiful graphics . recommended is the default card mode , which is also the default setting , or the window mode , which corresponds to the representation in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition this menu contains one entry for each open sub@@ window . with a selection of one entry , the corresponding sub@@ window is activated .
switches the display of the status bar at the bottom edge of the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main window or out .
the changes in this dialog has any application to use the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ web browsers .
the conduct of the editors . in the documentation of &amp; Kate ; you will find details .
a dialog appears in which you can delete entries out of the tool@@ bars , or add which series will follow .
this should generate a help in the environment of the mouse , but is not implemented yet .
&amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any open source project , developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ development in financial form , you will find here the way .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be completed at the top of the project called the whole directory structure for the rest of the project . all these paths and author information fields can be completed later with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties .
here is the name to enter the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name , file is completed automatically .
this is the name of the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; project file . by default , it has the name of the project in lower@@ case and without spaces with the enlargement web@@ cam@@ j ( e.@@ g f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can access the machine address of the machine , which you want to access one , besides one processed local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exempl@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.0.0@@ .1 ) are possible .
if one can empty this field empty , the default settings of the selected protocols can be used . depending on the remote computer , the remote data may be necessary .
this is the folder where the templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and standard templates . if a common collection of files used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standards .
this is the folder where the tool can be stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and as default tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standards .
that allows files to insert files from local file system into the project . several files or entire folders can be selected .
this setting is great if you have a static web content that you want to download and change . if necessary scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc . ) one must go different .
if files , if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project , are to be mounted . if a project is started on new , not an@@ ha@@ ze .
with this option , all files and folders will be displayed inside the main character and you can take a precise selection of good things .
this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by means of pin , cl@@ amps out of the project .
the last screen of the new project assistant contains three settings to simpli@@ fy your work . these settings can also instantly upload these settings to the menu in the menu in the bottom window profiles or with the short@@ cut Shift . F@@ 7 can be changed .
some settings correspond to those in the project assist@@ ants and are described in detail . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( plac@@ eholder possible ) which can be re @-@ related to project related operations like project folder .
complem@@ entary option to top , also files that are listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ or are excluded from the project .
the project can be loaded when opening the project . it can be read more about projec@@ tions .
this can be selected by the deb@@ ug@@ ger . currently , G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information on G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the deb@@ ug@@ ger @-@ plug@@ in can be configured with the options . in it , the troub@@ les@@ hooting are described .
in the bottom window profiles , high @-@ la@@ de@@ profiles ( see in ) can be adjusted , as well as the display of a building for each profile , by selecting a separate module for each profile .
in the sub @-@ window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a ma@@ iling list . see details .
in the window event configuration , one can switch the event actions and add this actions to change or delete any event actions , if a previously specified event , such as the sick@@ le of a file . see details .
standard opens &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the last project that was opened . this behaviour is currently not able to influence this behavior .
to open a different project , select Project ... from the menu Project or the Symbol Project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog is opened and allows selecting a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
if &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; closed , the project file is stored automatically . you are asked if you want to save changes prior to leaving , if &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; changed files . the same happens when you invite a new project .
the project management gives free access to the files in the project . you can manage the files in the current project .
folders , as well , however , the entries are open to open and open with ... in the right button of mouse click on the context menu :
here are different profiles can be selected . the profile contains information about the place of uploaded files . see .
enables the removal of the current profile . if only a profile is available , the button will cut off to prevent removing the removal .
the password will be kept in the core memory and be forgotten by program . this possibility is useful if common up@@ loading files is necessary , and the rather un@@ safe password on the plate does not come into question .
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your opinion in front of the upload .
in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; many high @-@ la@@ de@@ profiles can be uploaded and therefore the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to various servers . when editing or creation of a profile will be shown this dialog :
that is the name of the server that should be copied to files . either a fully qualified domain name or IP address work .
the transfer protocol for the up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; K@@ DE ; and the installed K@@ io slaves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( locally ) and NFS .
the port for the transfer . usually , this must not be changed , except the network administrator operates a service on the usual port .
depending on your attack@@ ing shaft , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a risk . if your password is stored on the plate , so that it can &apos;t be easily read , but everyone can see it in clear text .
a project view is only one set of files and tool bar . it can be loaded in a project a lot of views , i.e. through simple diving views , you can load several files and tool@@ bars , and replace the currently opened files and tool bar .
views can be opened in the menu project or the project tool@@ bar , can be accessed via Settings tool bar tool@@ bar , open or deleted .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; with which one has to do most . this helps not only increase productivity but also allows adjusting the adaptation of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ;
as already mentioned above , tool ben@@ ds in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; best possible on the menu tool bar . use and add tool bars can be treated below in the section of tool@@ bars .
the tool@@ bars and symbols can be set either by context menu ( right click on the tool@@ bar ) , which will be able to set up other promotions such as tool@@ bar , tool bar ren@@ aming or tool bar , which can be specified in the dialog , where can be able to be visible on these or other tool bar .
by calling the context menu on a tool@@ bar ( symbol ) on a tool@@ bar , additionally the entries must be removed and action displayed , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tool@@ bars and the actions of them can set up in the menu with settings ... and settings can be set .
templates are in the essential document , code @-@ Schnitz@@ el and files for linking . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; used templates as a common fil@@ esystem with advanced organization and interfaces . you can copy , move or any of the system available in the pre @-@ level system . templates are in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in about restrictions that is presenting itself for the file system .
some with &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; supplied templates have the conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template .
binary is everything that is not pure text . it can be inserted any file except text , i.e. images , &amp; PDF ; s , flash files &amp; etc . some examples are usually available in the pre @-@ level under global templates . further information on templates is available in .
documents can be created by any text document . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . usually , a simple rum@@ or can be found in corresponding way to efficiently . some examples may be found under global templates . see also for more information on templates .
this type of templates is useful if not a new document should be inserted again on a template but the same text area can be found in documents through a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl . some examples are listed under global templates . see for more information on templates .
as the name suggests , this templates for all websites as templates . they are a collection of different documents , which can be organized in a folder t@@ inc@@ ture . there are no examples in a compressed t@@ ar archives . currently there are no examples in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ;
create a document structure according to Bel@@ i@@ eben ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; ) and choose File As template as a local template ....
once this is done , note that ( even if it was stored as a project pre@@ set ) the template is not visible in the project tree . check out in pre @-@ tree under project templates .
in your document , select text in your document and store your selection to a selection of a local / project template . alternatively , the selection can easily be drawn with pulling and lay on the basis of building templates .
the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can copy only in a pre @-@ file folder . you can copy all file management functions , such as pulling , and insert or insert about the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or .
one can click on a folder to click on a folder on the right and to secure a folder to backup and secure a name for the template , but of course , it can be stored as a local or global template .
project pre@@ ferences enable a very well @-@ oriented approach . you can add head@@ lines and foot@@ lines , or linked files , or linking them . in addition , some things can keep some things using templates very deep in mind .
the initial structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / apps and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps and files . each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers , such as above .
to order to select the behaviour of a folder with the right mouse button on the folder and select the context menu tab . the following dialog appears :
a selection box with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is b@@ lown off , as soon as El@@ derly attributes are mis@@ ulated .
this is activated by default and fits all except the root folder . if a root folder would be set in principle , unless it would be explicitly enabled . in case of a normal folder would be enabled . in case of a normal folder would be activated . if nothing appears , you probably be in a stem folder .
allows a set or tested text for templates in this folder . this could be general head@@ lines or foot@@ lines for all templates into a folder with special head@@ lines / foot@@ steps a whole presentation already with the appropriate head@@ lines / foot@@ lines .
additionally , we have a full screen menu ( pressing the right mouse button ) over a full command collection for adding folders or copy and add templates from one place to another .
&amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; Source Editor , which can be reached via the menu View . the first mode replaces the source editor in two parts : the source editor and the V@@ PL ; Editor .
the V@@ PL ; Editor works as follows : he will load a document as a normal &amp; HTML ; - or X@@ HTML ; -@@ page and a cur@@ sor appears . then you can edit and dis@@ able the source code editor in which the amended changes in the V@@ PL ; Editor is visible in the source code .
when working with the V@@ PL ; editor on a document , which contains &amp; PHP ; it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; Editor is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; editor is still the source editor . there are no plans to change these behavi@@ ours .
the second mode is just like the first , except for the changes both in the source editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor , this mode is active as well as compared to the active cur@@ sor from a window to the others , where the position is retained in the document .
the synchron@@ ization distance between the V@@ PL ; Editor and the source editor can be adjusted via settings .. After choice of V@@ PL ; View , the recommendation can be set automatically between synchron@@ ization after a click or automatically . in principle , the recommendation : a small span for fast computer and a large range of slow motion .
supp@@ ose you want to change the title of the website , so it is possible to choose the documentation of invisible tags when working with the V@@ PL ; Editor is also called , as soon as a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; Editor is also possible to change the suspension of the hands .
met@@ a @-@ tags set up the storage of information about the document themselves e.g. tags for internet search engines . met@@ a @-@ elements can be added or removed . one click on the list allows changing the in@@ hal@@ tes , e.g. keywords on the column name and key key@@ word key .
CSS rules are the new way of design in the browser . you can add CSS rules using buttons under the list or delete . a change over the list is not supported using the met@@ a @-@ elements . editing of CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to insert a external CSS style selection by clicking on the file button and select the appropriate file .
the use of cur@@ sors is as in a text processing , thanks to the arrows , possible . under rare circumstances , the cur@@ sor works as usual . text can be inserted as usual . text can be inserted by plug@@ ins and extingu@@ ish by pressing or distances .
the inser@@ tion of tags is done in the same way via the tool editor , as described in the source editor , e.g. if an anchor @-@ day is inserted as an anchor tag , is en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed with text , each other surrounding anch@@ ors must be removed .
some tools such as the tables assistant or the lists of tables are disabled . they are later used in &amp; V@@ PL ; do not work in this release , tables or lists of tool bar must be used .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for investigation of styles . in contrast to other programs for styles , search for certain elements is possible and the execution of the styles can be pursued .

there are many graphical tools for the same . why so &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me tell me why I wrote .
the merger was very complicated because one of the contributions had been made and simultaneously corrected to many places . another programmer had changed much text in the same file . the result were many conflicts when shooting .
the program used by me was just the changed lines , but I could not see what exactly had changed within these lines . and there was no evidence regarding the places where perhaps , there was perhaps one of these changes was a small night@@ mare .
that was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could display differences within one line and changes to white characters . later , any quantity of more useful features were added .
if you want to compare text fast text , copy it simply into the clip@@ board and add it in one of the comparison window .
a function of work , was the same and merge of folders . this function was turned &amp; diff@@ 3 ; almost into a full file browser .
also 3 @-@ way encoding is fully supported . this is useful if two persons can work independently from each other one piece of Ko@@ de and the modifications at the same time . in this Editor , you can even edit the result . in this editor , you can even edit the result . the screenshot shows three quot@@ as files when assembling :
&amp; low diff@@ 3 ; helps you complete the same and merge folder . this screenshot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in the folder merge :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and is based on the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you often have to check this function you will like this function .
differences in white characters and tab@@ ul@@ ators are visible . if lines are visible in a certain number of white characters , one can see at a glance at the summary in column at the left side . ( no trouble more , if any one changes the influence . )
if a file is equal , and the others distingu@@ ishes itself in one row , then depic@@ ts the color which is different . red color means that both files are different .
if all files are in the same name , but in different folders , you can facilitate the t@@ ipp@@ ment by using only the fil@@ en@@ ames of the first file . example :
diff@@ 3 Fol@@ ner@@ 1 folder and diffuse folder with diffuse 3 folder : diffuse 3 folder , folder 3 folder
the opening dialog box allows manual type fil@@ en@@ ames , select the selection via the file browser ( file ... ) or the exit of a last modified file . if you need to specify a third file ; if you have no third file , the analysis of the differences can be carried out with two files .
via the button file ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the same or combination of folders will be selected , for B and C but a folder will then use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ames are used in both other folders .
when assembling , the input field is active for goal and can process itself . it is not necessarily necessary to set immediately an output file . you can do this step later when saving .
the setup button opens a dialog with Settings . you can set up options before you start with the same / merge .
sometimes you want to compare a text but only parts of a text . &amp; low diff@@ 3 ; allows you to select text parts from clip@@ board into the active comparison window . compared to the opening dialog , you can simply select the dialog with the shut@@ down button .
you can also use drag and departure : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from a editor and let it fall over a comparison window .
which thought is behind it ? sometimes contains a file e.g. several similar functions . if you want to figure out these functions , they would like to compare and compare these functions . now you can easily copy and compare the relevant sections .
note : currently , you can &apos;t pull out any out of &amp; diff@@ 3 ; only the case can be supported by text in a comparison window .
warning : some editors interpre@@ t the drag and lay text into another program as cut and insert ( instead of copying and insert ) . in such a case , your original data might be lost .
in the upper part of each text window , the info line contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ame and the line number of the first visible row . ( if the path comes to a file , let the mouse rest on the line . then a small relief window will show the full name . )
the three source windows are assigned to letters A , B and C . A has the color blue , B the color green and C is magical . ( these settings can be changed over the settings menu . )
if a difference is detected , you can see the color which file is differenti@@ ated . if both files are differenti@@ ated . the color scheme is especially useful when you compare three files . this is well visible in the next section ( merge ) .
left next to the text is the summary column . if differences were found , the column displays the appropriate colour . with some programming languages , white characters is not so important to see the relevant changes only in character cass@@ ettes and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in few , more rarely relevant cases . )
the vertical line , which separates the summary column of text , is interrupted by the digits , where the source file has no lines . if the line is enabled , the line is shown on broken lines .
the outcome window ( below the comparison window ) has also an Info line with the inscription edition : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; Ge@@ changes &#93; if you have done the result . usually , it contains the automatic compilation , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts have dis@@ band@@ ed , the deposit is disabled ! ! ! ( use the buttons to next dissolved / un@@ solved conflict in order to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two comparative windows is used , any difference is to be replaced at the same time .
by one click with the left mouse button in one of the windows , the group is shown in all windows , where the first group is highlighted in the windows . this group is then highlighted in the beginning of the group . it will be highlighted the color background color for current section and on the left is a black beams .
sometimes , by automatic interaction , or by manual edit any further line , no further line is left ; it is not only a plac@@ eholder for the case that you may change your opinion and perhaps once again a different source . this text appears neither in the final file , nor in a mark which you might want to copy and somewhere else .
the text &amp; lt ; merge set@@ backs ; however , in the clip@@ board , if you copy such a text from the spring window . go carefully with this function .
note : if the options are able to ign@@ ore the options listed below or Ig@@ nor@@ ers C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white characters .
this will navigate mainly with the images and mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you &apos;re in one of the window , you can use it in one of the window . if you can use it from other programs , Si@@ w as you can also use other programs . in addition to the vertical frame bar , you can also click navig@@ ated to navigation .
in the eye window , you can also use the other buttons to edit . using the insert button , you can switch between single feet and over@@ drive mode . ( default is the set @-@ up mode ) .
one click with the left mouse button in one of the summary columns synchron@@ izes view of all windows at the beginning of the respective group ( as already in the section and the editing output window ) .
the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons to navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / previous difference ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ down / C@@ tr@@ l picture ) , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ down / Str@@ g @-@ picture ) or to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ down / Str@@ g @-@ picture ) . therefore , all non @-@ dissolved conflicts continues to be regarded as a conflict . therefore , between sol@@ ving and un@@ solved conflicts has to be distinguished .
in order to copy the marking into clip@@ board , you need to copy the copying button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ l @-@ In@@ sert ) . if this option is enabled , it will automatically mark you into the clip@@ board . be careful with this option , because you could see the contents of the clip@@ board .
z@@ eil@@ ing are stored according to the underlying operating system . UNIX variants use a line curtain \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 ret@@ ains the c@@ eil@@ ing of the source files , therefore you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also do not use binary files .
the options and the list of the files used are automatically saved and re @-@ produced during the next start . ( setting up menu &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... )
choose a script with fixed width . ( in some systems , the dialog provides fonts with variable width to choose , but you should not use it . )
if you activate this option , differences are displayed in short font . if the selected Scripture does not support this representation , nothing happens .
in systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in its pure form , but would be in@@ filtr@@ ated . in these systems , the button def@@ aults automatically provides an un@@ stable color .
if this option is enabled , the tab@@ ulator button is inserted the corresponding number of spaces . otherwise , a tab@@ ulator will be inserted .
when entering or return , the insert on the previous line will automatically be used for the next row .
if this option is enabled , each selection will be copied automatically into the clip@@ board . manual copying into the clip@@ board .
you can choose which type @-@ type type you prefer to store . the default value is the generally usual selection at the used operating system .
during the same time attempts &amp; diffuse 3 ; first , all fully identical lines can be found in the source files . in this step , white characters can be ig@@ no@@ red . in this step , white characters are not ig@@ no@@ red . even when assembling , white characters are not ig@@ no@@ red .
some editors ( on some systems ) save a car jack &apos; \ &apos; at the end of one line , but then you could save files with different sizes in side @-@ side comparison , but if this option is activated , but like a white character will be disabled , but this option has to be de@@ activated . in default , this option is de@@ activated .
in default , this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis are numbers and related characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) ign@@ ore the differences , but they will be treated like white characters .
in default , this option is disabled . changes in comments are covered as changes in white characters .
inten@@ sely after even smaller under@@ differences . option is enabled in the default setting . it is effective in complicated and large files but slowly at very large files .
in automatic further jump mode , this setting , how long will the result of the selection will be displayed , before the next post @-@ sale conflict will continue .
dis@@ solves automatically every conflicts in white characters by selecting the chosen file as a source . if you need it only from time to time , then use the automatic selection of conflicts in numbers or comments , if the options ign@@ ore the numbers , or Ig@@ nor@@ ers C / C + + comments are activated .
these options are described in chapter for scanning of folders and execute a merge . look for details under documentation for the directory comparing and merge .
if a file is stored and already an older version exists , then the original version is the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ original file , if already such a backup file with the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ original exists , this will be deleted without backup .
the language of the user interface does not adap@@ ting the current program . you must finish &amp; diffuse , so that the change is active . ( this option is set in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set up to the control centre globally . )
the following coefficients settings can be set separately for each entry . if you use this option , the following adjustment is used for all entries .
over the selection fields for coding is a short note that the local coding is . ( this can &apos;t be changed here and has for you pure inform@@ al character . )
adjust the file coding for source files . this affects as special characters are treated and interpre@@ ting . as the coding for each file can be adjusted individually , even files with different coding can be compared and combined .
if you have a file , you can define which coding is to be used for storing .
if you define pre @-@ processing command , they could not be able to work with your codec . ( e.g. , your files can &apos;t work 16 @-@ bit ASCII . ) Using this option , you can define the coding of the output command line .
switch this , to supp@@ ress the modifications of changes in white characters in text or over@@ sight . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments when the options ign@@ ore the numbers or Ig@@ nor@@ ers C / C + + comments . )
this selection is only available if you compare three files . however , the differences between two of three files are displayed . however , you may only want to see the differences between two of three files . according to the selection of A &amp; lt ; C , A &amp; lt ; C , C or B &amp; lt ; C is indicated in addition to the normal a second over@@ lay column with the required information .
sometimes you would like to use the available square on the screen for long lines . simply use the less important window . ( this option is located in the window menu . )
the comparison window un@@ ks each other or over each other . this can also be useful for ads of long lines . ( this option is located in the window menu . )
sometimes you consider the differences and then choose the files to comp@@ ile the files . current file will continue to compare the file names and use the fil@@ en@@ ames of the last source file as an vo@@ iced name for the output file , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . )
at the reading of a file it will pass first to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can use your own pre@@ processor that corresponds to your own requirements . you can use this function for example to cut or correct parts or correct .
at the reading of a file it is given first to this external command . if also a normal pre@@ processing command was used ( see above ) , then the output of command is used only in line spac@@ ing . you can write your own pre@@ processor that corresponds to your own requirements . each input line needs to have a corresponding output line .
the idea behind it is to enable the user more flexibility when inser@@ ting the di@@ ff results . however , most users would like to program , and most users would like to program the good news , that in most cases SE@@ D or Perl is completely sufficient .
use this pre@@ processing command for line tri@@ but@@ ary directly to the input in large letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
CV@@ S and other ver@@ sion@@ ing systems use some key words ( info : / c@@ vs / \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
while she experim@@ enting with SE@@ D , you may be able to understand and perhaps do you like this regular expres@@ sions even . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
the no@@ ig@@ no@@ res of numbers is actually a built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it &apos;s good as an example of a further processing command for line tri@@ but@@ s . SE@@ D &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Each character between &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hits , and any hits will be replaced by nothing .
sometimes you would like to perform several goals at once . then you can use the Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; , in order to split the goals of one another . example :
instead SE@@ D you can also use anything other such as Perl . Perl -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ G@@ EX@@ P / replacement / switches &apos; aller@@ dings are needed at Perl . where SE@@ D \ \ ( and \ \ ) are needed , Perl needs only ( and ) without the set &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data according to the normal pre@@ processor are retained for the ad and to build . further operations change only the data that the line spac@@ ing like @-@ Al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus .
note : in rare cases when you use a normal pre @-@ processing unit , the line of the micro@@ processor looks like input .
the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as in any function , the text changes or differences , you can &apos;t notice certain differences and destroy significant data in the worst case .
often , programmer must process many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and assem@@ ble complete folders with &amp; diff@@ 3 ; complete folder .
... for any object a suggest@@ ion : you can adapt the suggest@@ ion before the start ,
... can sim@@ ulate the sim@@ ulated changes to sim@@ ulated the sim@@ ulated changes , without interrup@@ ting them ,
... leads selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) or only with selected objects ( F6 @-@ key ) .
this is similar to the same and merge of individual files very similar . you must open a folder on the command line or in a dialog file .
if three folders are merged , folder will be used as a basis . if no target folder is indicated , uses &amp; diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as a target folder .
note that only the comparison of folders will start automatically , not the mer@@ ging of folders , select the menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( further details follow . )
during the reading of the folder you will be informed of a small news window over current progress . if you cancel the folder , only the files are listed , which were compared to then .
when scanning of the folder is completed , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with results on the left side , ...
any file and every folder that was found during the scan is displayed here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder t@@ inc@@ ture is normally folded . you can double click on the + / - click on the + / - click on the + / - click on the + / - click on the button or show all sub@@ directories with which you can open all the folder .
if you double @-@ click on a file , the file is started and it appears a comparison window .
the symbol in column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in different folders , this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detailed windows to the selected object . in such case , the cl@@ umps action cannot be selected automatically . if the mer@@ ging set is started , you will be informed about problems of this kind .
as in the above picture you can see in the columns A / B / C the colors red , green , yellow and black .
in identical entries , the color is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different .
folders are considered as identical if its entire content is identical . then , folder the same color . in folders , the age is not considerable for its color .
the idea to this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a sheet back , which is only green , then yellow and later when it is old , red .
... A and C identical , but not B : copy B ( or if B ) does not exist , delete the target , if it exists )
... A and B identical , but not C : copy C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target , if it exists )
... B and C identical , but not A : copy A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target , if it exists )
... A , B and C does not have the same file type ( e.g. if a file and B file is ) : error : contra@@ dic@@ tory file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , cannot be launched .
... A and B does not have the same file type ( e.g. if a file and b a file is ) : error : contra@@ dic@@ tory file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , cannot be launched .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mode for synchron@@ ising is active if only two folders and no explicitly specified target folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the option is synchron@@ ously active . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action is identical , so that both folders are identical . if you have an entry ... &quot; &quot; &quot;
... A and B exist , but not identical : assem@@ ble and save the result in both folders . ( the user looks as the visible file names for the output file only B ; directly after assembling , copied &amp; diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
if two folders will be merged and select the option of new file instead of merge ( un@@ safe ) , but the date of files are different , but the date is identical . if such errors are not removed , the folders cannot be launched .
during the coll@@ ision , a file is done after the other hand . if the coll@@ ision was successful , and according to other reports , if something unexpected occurs , you should take a last review and see whether the status is everywhere in order .
if in the installation dialog box is selected to view the file &apos;s comparative analysis , K@@ Diff@@ usion is deleted , is dissolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for sol@@ ving conflicts is displayed only if three folders are compared to or merged . )
you can either set the selected entry ( file or Od@@ ner ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all coll@@ ation actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start the coll@@ ision .
please note : if you have no target folder , then the Three @-@ file @-@ merge mode C is used as the objective , when two folders will lead B as a goal and when synchron@@ ize , A and / or B is used as a target .
if you select a target folder , please check whether all entries must be displayed in the target folder . there are some options to be sk@@ ipped with specific entries . check these options to avoid un@@ pleasant sur@@ prises :
to start all entries : select the directory together / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( key@@ note ) . in order to move the current entry , select the current element to run or press F6 .
if by contra@@ dic@@ tory file types still exist , a message appears that shows the faul@@ ty elements , you can choose to select a valid promotion .
if you merge all entries , a dialog window appears with the options , sim@@ ulate and break down .
select Sim@@ ulate if you would like to see what would happen if you really want to change without the really changes . you will get a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; diff@@ 3 ; then led certain actions with all entries . if a manual procedure is necessary ( summar@@ izing a single file ) , then a merge window will open ( note the screenshot ) .
if you are finished with a file , select the directory together / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you have not saved again , a corresponding dialog appears . then leads &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; his work will continue with the next entry .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on a mistake , a message appears and detailed status information . at the end of the list , you will be able to try out the cause of the problem . if you have the option to select the problem of the problem or to solve the problem in any way before you proceed to the problem .
if some entries are summarized individually , please note &amp; diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and leads them not again in later . even if the inter@@ act has been carried out or not saved , these entries will be stored as done . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged again .
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ usion ... ) now has a section called directory mer@@ ging with these options :
only files that are displayed on the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree . separate plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folder must not correspond to this pattern .
files and folders correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be used as a sample , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as a separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ O .

ign@@ ore files that are also ig@@ no@@ red by CV@@ S . many autonomous files are ig@@ no@@ red by CV@@ S . the great advantage is that this folder can be set with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( check below info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some file systems you have a default attri@@ bute . in other file systems this option lets you decide whether these files are displayed in the element tree or not . this option is switched on in default .
links to files : if the option is switched off , symbolic correc@@ tions are compared . if the option is enabled , the files are compared to the links . this is de@@ activated in default .
if the option is switched on : if the option is switched off , the links are switched on . if the option is switched on , the links such as normal folders will lead and recur@@ sively reviews . ( note : if the option is switched on , the links would lead to a link . ) This option is shut down on a link . ) This option is shut down in default .
the full analysis of each file carries out the statistic columns . ( the number of dissolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower , if they are applied to files that does not contain text . ( specify an appropriate anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare big folders through a slow network , it may be faster , only the date of change and file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you to be careful . please check this option is in default .
similar to confidenti@@ ality of date . there is no real comparison instead . the files are considered as identical if it is equal to , for example , if copying the change date . please use with cau@@ tion . this option is retri@@ eved in default .
activ@@ ating the synchron@@ izing mode if two folders are compared to and no target folder . in this mode , the proposals will be identical to both folders . also the results of the files are stored in both folders . this option is shut down in default .
if there are differences , the copy of the newer file is suggested as action . ( this will be considered in@@ secure , because it is not changed that other file would not be changed . ) This option is shut down in any case . ) This option is shut down .
if a file or file is replaced by another file , then the original version will be renamed and will receive the extension .@@ original If an old backup file is already deleted , this will not only be able to run the entire folder . this option is switched on full folders . this option is switched on in default .
normally the folders remains visible to the merge of individual files ; you can switch the window part with the mouse . if you like this , you can switch the window window in the window menu and switch between the two views between the two views .
probably , you prefer to compare a file via double @-@ click . however , you can also install a single file without loos@@ ing the folder . if you use the file , the status will be done automatically and the file will not be merged again when you run the folder .
however , this status is lost , if you read the list here : directory -@@ menu : new reading
K@@ DE supports network transparent with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ Diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way you can specify files and folders to open , which are on local or remote computers .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one on a FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder inside a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has another syntax than local files and folders . a few things you should note :
a path can be relatively young . or .. included . that &apos;s not possible with UR@@ Ls , these are always absolutely .
special characters must be placed . ( # - &gt; % 23 , idle &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes through the protocol . it follows a short list of limitations :
or it can &apos;t be differenti@@ ated if a link is shown to a file or folder . then a file is displayed as link destination . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) .
there is no opportunity to process permission or change of change . hence , the authorization or change of change from the original . ( note , this option is possible to check out the size . ) ( This is only possible for local files . )
the main purpose of use is currently as differences in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op starts first to start the built @-@ in differences . in order to start K@@ Diff@@ usion , press the right mouse button above the differences and then select In K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part , from the context menu .
normally it needs &amp; diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files , if it is used as K@@ Part , a patch file takes place in Uni@@ fied format . at least one of the two files needs to exist . then starts &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch to recover the missing file .
in the Kon@@ quer@@ or , you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu Preview - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . note that it does not work if any of the original files exists . Moreover , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since generation of patch file .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as Part is carried out , it supports only the same of two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . the assembly or the same folders is not supported in the K@@ Part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ usion ( now He@@ ist ) is already available . furthermore , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can lead to the program diffuse 3 from the di@@ ff tool collection .
I am using G@@ PL programs already very long and have learned much , I have looked into the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all the programmers gone or going to go .
you probably compiled the program from the sources and configure the configure pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in default , K@@ DE is not installed in / us@@ r / local but then K@@ DE can not find resources for user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diffuse 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file you can find more information on this topic .
if only the number of white characters is different , these lines will be smaller than identical ; if not only a non @-@ white characters is different , the line is not identical . if the lines of your next to Each other , this is co@@ inci@@ des this is the case .
the editor will be noted for any difference in the files where he starts and where he ends . this important information is lost , if the result is simply stored as text file , and it is too much effort to create an own file format that could save this information .
the effort for this was so far too big . you can always restore a specific version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger amounts of text , another editor should be used .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after removing text , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No sr@@ c lin@@ ux ; released and the text can &apos;t be put out . what does that mean and how can this be removed ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; used as many colors for raising under@@ differences . even more Her@@ vor@@ ce would be conf@@ using and missing the purpose . please use another editor .
many good ideas and troub@@ les@@ hooting came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you need &amp; K@@ DE ; 3.1 or newer .
you can use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE , you can find on the homepage .
you can find a list of the last changes under h@@ tt@@ p : / / k@@ diffuse 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the file Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the Qu@@ ell package .
to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; install and install on a system with &amp; K@@ DE ; use the following command in the basic folder of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; distribution :
K@@ DE @-@ you gives the folder in your system , where K@@ DE is installed . if you are un@@ safe , you will find further details in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file .
da &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake , you should have no problems when comp@@ ile . should you have problems , please report to the &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ mail@@ ing@@ lists thereof .
cut out ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or Um@@ sch@@ alt @-@ Remove ) copied to the selected text . insert ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or Um@@ sch@@ alt @-@ In@@ sert ) add the text from clip@@ board to the current cur@@ sor position and replaces the current marking .
only differences : files that are identical in all folders does not appear in folders , and therefore also not in the target folder .
( in the current program version , you have to re @-@ read the folder to these options with the update feature . )
only entries are displayed only . this also causes the files to be copied to the target folder . if the target file does not contain these files , they are missing according to the coll@@ isions . ( the behaviour is probably modified in a later program version . ) This option is ob@@ sol@@ ete in default .
note the buttons to choose the source with the label A , B and C below the menu bar . if you &apos;re on one of the buttons , the lines are attached to the end of the selected group in the window window . if the lines are already present , they will be returned to the button on the button .
in default , this option is disabled . under@@ differences in single characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; shows a Mini@@ preview of all virtual work surfaces . it is quite practical to alter the ongoing programs on the work@@ areas to end their size or move them . this works within a work area as well as with several .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual work surfaces as well as the applications . applications can be selected and even moves on the working area and to others .
with the middle button of mouse you can move windows within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; moving both within a work@@ space and other work surfaces .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked on the empty background of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; however , the context menu does not appear on an application within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; however , the context menu and the name of the application as well as the entries , maxim@@ ize the working area and end . the commands work the following commands :
maxim@@ izes the application window on the full size of the working area . appears only if using an application .
sends the application to selected virtual work@@ space . only if on an application has been clicked on .
this box is marked , window can be moved inside the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the work@@ space and can be moved to other work@@ areas .
when this field is crossed in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the names of virtual work@@ areas are displayed .
check@@ box this field can display the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the numbers of virtual work surfaces . is it together with name , the name will be provided with ord@@ inal numbers , &amp; eg ; 1 . working area .
if this field is crossed , the background of each working area is also displayed as a background in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ;
if this field is crossed , the current programs will be displayed as small windows in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise , only the empty working area will be displayed to allow their selection .
here the view of the program window is selected . simply shows simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the propor@@ tions of the program window . icon shows a small view of the real program window . re@@ mark : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here , the order of the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the main window can be known : classic &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; such as P@@ ager applications appear in some other Windows managers ; all virtual work@@ areas in a vertical row , which is very good for the presentation on the side of the working area .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini program in the control panel . it has the advantage that it can display windows as symbols or with its content and move out outside the control panel .
clicking on the right button of mouse within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; and subsequent re@@ mot@@ ions can be set up ... can be displayed in the dialog .
currently that cannot be changed in the dialog for Settings - but you can do it manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor , such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or VI If you do not have a write permission for the file , you need to enter the key win@@ dow@@ transparent fashion in this file , you need to refer to the key win@@ dow@@ transparent fashion in this file . possible values are :

&amp; k@@ mag ; is a screen tor@@ ch . you can read a screen for the smaller printed or exact viewing of a photos . this application is interesting for various users : this application includes artists , web designers and people with a visual impact . this documentation is to be a complete manual for the use of &amp; k@@ mag ;
&amp; k@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly expanded by new functions . it is optimized for use on performance weak computers .
if you are &amp; k@@ mag , a window appears as shown above . the main window of screen . in the following will be displayed as a magni@@ fication window . the image , which is displayed in the magni@@ fication window , is called an enlarged area of screen and is called below the selection window .
in the standard settings are increased &amp; k@@ mag ; the area around the mouse indicator as a mobile magni@@ fying glass . alternatively , you can display &amp; k@@ mag ; for a selected screen range in the magni@@ fication window ( selection mode ) or the environment of the mouse button on the screen ( eg ; on the left screen ) .
if you want to avoid the mouse indicator in the enlarged window , select the mouse button , select the mouse button . please note that the mouse is not able to detect the form of the mouse . this is always the default K@@ DE ; / Q@@ t .
in the selection window mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be found in the following way :
move the mouse into a magni@@ fication window and hold the left mouse button , so you can move the contents of the magni@@ fication window and move them with the arrow keys .
if you also use the &amp; Shift ; check or use the &amp; M@@ MB ; you can move the selection window .
with this combination , you can change the size of the selection window . note that the upper left corner of the selection window is fixed and only the lower right corner is to move .
&amp; like ; possesses a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer to insert into a file to insert it into other applications ( to insert it later into other applications ) , the image and much more .
starts or stops the update of the display . stopping the update , the required CPU time has to be 0 .
select the Update rate ( Very low , Low , Medium , H@@ och , Very high ) . the higher the actu@@ alization rate , the more CPU time is needed .
in this mode , a select window will be displayed . the selected area will be displayed in one window .
&amp; k@@ mag ; automatically setup the short command to store files , opening a new window , print , new@@ bie ( with the button document again in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; ) , Enlarge and c@@ lei@@ c &amp; etc .
k@@ iller also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; is a screen t@@ eller . you can use &amp; c@@ magni@@ fier ; for this application use a magni@@ fier , to use the smaller printed in a newspaper or a photo . this application is suitable for different people of benefits : from research or artists to web@@ designer or vision .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse click on the same spot as soon as the mouse has been running on the same spot . it is thought to help people who suffer from RS@@ I syndrome ( rep@@ et@@ itive strain relief syndrome ) and which each mouse click pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse click on the same spot as soon as the mouse switch on the same spot . it is intended to help people who em@@ ulate a mouse click on the rep@@ lica of the mouse . it also requires a little exercise .
&amp; m@@ ous@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain that occurs in order to use the mouse , and helps so many people to assem@@ ble the computer without pain . unfortunately , do not suffer pain that have been merged with the use of your computer , if this is not yet done .
in order to make it even more clear : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool should be avoided by clicking on the mouse , it is necessary to prevent pain that applies through the mouse because of the mouse is , us@@ eless . and as with all ergonomic support , the result can fall for each other .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse moving and leads a mouse click , as soon as you break the movement briefly .
if the smart transfer is activated , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a break after the pressing of the mouse is em@@ ulated . you can now move it until the end of the mouse . the smart transfer requires a little exercise , but you get it quickly .
at the end of the mouse movement , before the end of the mouse movement , before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click brings out .
if you are switched on , the rotation speed is switched on ( 1 / 10 s ) . this is set the time limit , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after shut@@ down the mouse button is waiting before it takes off the mouse button if there is no maint@@ ainer due to the mouse .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now support the click to right and back , followed by a break , followed by a break . this moves are saved in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ est@@ kes@@ .@@ txt . the first time is started , but they can be changed later .
when the sound is delayed , you can move &amp; K@@ DE , to move the response time . open the &amp; k@@ control@@ center ; , go to sound &amp; multimedia , choose a sound system and here the rider . there is a sli@@ der sound buffer that allows you to reduce the response times .
if this setting is marked , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is launched ; at each start of &amp; K@@ DE , this function is currently only under &amp; K@@ DE ; available . at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments please click the corresponding documentation to find out how you start a program automatically .
sets all settings on the values back when opening the dialog . have already pressed the button on the user , the settings will be reset to the user after the last pressing of the user .
best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; initially with default settings . in particular the smart slide should be switched off at first . if you want to click on the automatic mouse , you can leave the smart transfer later .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; K@@ DE , if necessary .
at first , you should make a mouse click without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or on positions within the browser window that does not display any link , does not run the mouse on such places until you want to use it again .
if your mouse is printed , you should clean your mouse . this is normally rather simple . the tri@@ ck is that you don &apos;t just clean the mouse balls , but also the rolls that are in contact with the mouse .
first you need to remove the mouse ball . as it happens , is from mouse to mouse , but it should be clear when you can view the bottom of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you should have to see the reels . these are in the sides of the Lo@@ cking , which the ball was used . the Dre@@ ck and the so@@ iling , you can easily scrat@@ ching the ball .
in very rare situations , the operating system has started the version of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you &apos;re using this case , it means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , this means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is not able to termin@@ ate the operation no more through the batch of the mouse .
this happens if you are &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; using a different window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem exists that you can run a mouse click . here , the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; reset and you can work as usual .
problem : if you enter text , tries &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to perform mouse clicks and sets the cur@@ sor to a different place .
solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor there . however , you do not want to bring the mouse on a neutral area of the work@@ space , if you want to bring back the mouse on a neutral area . safe zones for the mouse , you can do the gray surfaces around the tool bar and menus and cover lines of windows .
I try to work with intelligent shift , but I do not create it to edit text .
the intelligent shift is a advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you want to move it into the clip@@ board . if you want to move it back to any other action . but it will probably be able to prepare any problems for them . here are some advice to them :
don &apos;t use the smart slide if you just start to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; click on a mouse click on a mouse click on the end of the text box , while you move the mouse button to the other end of the text and re@@ use the mouse button .
use the audi@@ ble click . therefore , if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button is played . so , you can use the sound like a mouse click . later , you can use the smart transfer without the audi@@ ble mouse click . but it requires some exercise .
to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; you can use the X@@ test extension for &amp; X Window ; installed on the most system already .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble clicks is only available when the system has a sound card and speakers , and are set up correctly .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; operated the mouse button as soon as the mouse has been running short . this program was developed for people who suffer from RS@@ I Syndrome and to whom the firm has been prepared for pain .
&amp; m@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured as it is a certain time waiting to start a pulling @-@ process before the mouse is left off . in this way the mouse can also be done using the mouse .

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program that can talk to her computer for yourself .
using the program &amp; k@@ mouth ; you can dum@@ my users the computer for themselves . the user can choose from a list with the practical sentences that should be spoken again .
on the first page of the assistant ( left screen photo ) command the command that later used later for the voice of text . further details will be found in the description of the introductory dial@@ ogs .
on the second page you can select the default text @-@ fit book . you can often choose text pass@@ wort , without turning them . the passages can be edited of course .
on the third page ( right screen ) , select the dictionary for the Wor@@ lds . &amp; k@@ mouth ; read the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of the individual words . in addition , you can read the voc@@ als with a Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clearly evident and contains essentially a input field for the key@@ note of your propositions ( the lower white field in screen photo ) and an exp@@ ir@@ ation memory of the already spoken sentences ( the upper white field in screen photo ) .
if you &apos;re k@@ mouth , you can enter the phr@@ ases in the input field you can listen to the phr@@ ases you can hear . each spoken sentence is attached to the running memory . you can select the propositions which should be spoken once again .
with the menu entry settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the installation dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth . this dialog contains two cart@@ ography cards , voice output and settings , page Wor@@ lds , and the page K@@ TT@@ SD voice service .
in the input field of the box card , enter the command to call the language generators . in the selection box , select the string coding , with the text to the language generator .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to continue the text . select the check box when the text is to be delivered as standard entry to the language generator .
if the check box is not selected , the text is given as parameters . you can use the following plac@@ eholder :
of course , the command to the voice output of your language generator . this command can be found in the documentation to your language generator . examples of this command can be found in anne@@ x .
with possible lic@@ t as a voice service is used &amp; k@@ mouth ; as the first try to continue the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD voice service . if this option is a standardis@@ ed interface for voice and is currently further developed . the option of this option is useful , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
after selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the key@@ word or by selecting a text passage in the menu text pass@@ age@@ way or in the vest of text pass@@ age@@ way .
by selecting the selected text passage , the selected text passage is inserted directly and in addition to the input field . with the selection of In the input field , the selected text passage is only entered in the input field only .
using the second selection box Cl@@ ose of the processing window for text pass@@ agen@@ ic , you can define whether the text pass@@ age@@ way should be stored automatically when closing the processing window .
using the selection of text pass@@ age@@ book , the book will be stored . if you select changes , the textbook will not be stored . select before saving , will be stored &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask whether the text pass@@ age@@ way should be stored .
the page Wor@@ ter@@ onomy contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for Wor@@ lds . in the main window , in addition to the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection box contains more than a dictionary . with this selection box , you can choose the latest dictionary to Wor@@ lds .
with buttons on the right , you can delete dic@@ tion@@ aries or add the order of books or export to a file . below the list , you can choose the name and select the language for the dictionary .
select for this source the desired language ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; read the frequency of the individual words . additionally you can compare the words of the individual words . in addition , you can compare the word list with Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to insert the words into the new dictionary .
this option allows you to assem@@ ble the available words of dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask what dic@@ tion@@ aries together , and how they are weigh@@ ted .
using this option , insert a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly added words automatically create in the dictionary , generate a dictionary with your voc@@ abul@@ ary in the course of time .
the main window of the window for machining of text pass@@ tracks is divided in two parts . in the upper part , the text@@ books are shown as tree structure .
in the lower part you can select an selected entry . if you select a text passage , you can change the text passage or the associated keyboard book . if you select a text pass@@ age@@ way , you can only change its name .
actions like new text pass@@ ages or books , or select text passages and books you can choose either via the selection in the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar or via a drop @-@ down menu .
the sequence of passages or text pass@@ ages you can change using the mouse to the new job or with the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; button .
the chosen text is cut out and copied to clip@@ board . in case the input field is selected , this is used elsewhere , otherwise the selected areas of the running memory .
the chosen text is copied to clip@@ board . if in the input field is selected , this is used , otherwise the selected areas of memory storage is used .
the currently active set is spoken . if the text is found in the input field , this will be used otherwise the selected sets of running memory .
if the menu entry is attached , it will be displayed on a tool bar with buttons for frequently used commands . the tool bar is arranged directly under the menu bar . by mouse click on the sh@@ aded left side and drag the tool@@ bar to a different place .
if the menu entry is attached , a narrow ridge is displayed in the lower part of the main window with Hin@@ ds above the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; if not crossed , this status bar is b@@ lown off .
if the menu entry is crossed , it will be displayed on the processing window by default on the processing window directly under the tool bar . by mouse click on the sh@@ aded left side and drag the tool@@ bar to a different place .
probably you have not entered the command for the voice output correctly or not fully re@@ entered . open the page General Settings ... , open the page General settings and enter the command for voice from language syn@@ thesizer . ( see installation dialog for voice syn@@ thesizer . )
Festival is a language edition of the University of Edinburgh . currently , only English , Spanish and W@@ alis@@ isch supported . the license is allowed to use the festival for free and without restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting the voice edition , the festival will be installed in the folder / us@@ r / local / festival . the command line is then :
Free@@ T@@ TS is a in &amp; Java ; written language generator . currently , he only supports the English language . the license is allowed to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free and without restrictions .
in order to show an example of the command line for the establishment of the voice edition , Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the folder / us@@ r / local / local device . the voice output is then possible with one of the three following command examples :
for the third example , the option has to be switched on as standard input . ( this is the recommended example for the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ eme into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , therefore you need an additional program to cut the text in phon@@ eme . the license is permitted to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert German text in phon@@ eme for MB@@ RO@@ LA , under the ass@@ umption that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA in / us@@ r / local / fax fax and / us@@ r / local / mb@@ ro@@ la are installed .
unfortunately H@@ adi@@ fax had to be swal@@ lowed h@@ adi@@ fax to the latest sign of the text , so that an additional characters must be added . the full command is therefore more than in the other examples :
( CAT ) ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / us@@ r / local / bi@@ ro@@ la / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o / de@@ fle@@ .@@ wav ; art@@ board / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav ; art@@ board / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav
all parts of the command must be written in one row . the option data is to be switched on as default .
the voice dem@@ on of &amp; K@@ DE ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ further language service provided by all &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ applications a standard interface for language output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various language output systems .
because setting the language generators is made only in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you will only need to use c@@ lich@@ st as voice service in &amp; k@@ mouth .
for setting the page K@@ TT@@ SD voice service , which is installed in the dialog box of &amp; k@@ mouth ; if K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
in order to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; K@@ DE ; 3.x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB memory ( and additionally memory for the language generator ) , which depends on your computer and configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application , with people who cannot speak , lyrics by the calcul@@ ator . a list can already be saved in a list which the user can be re@@ opened again .
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no language syn@@ thesizer contains . on the computer you have to be a voice syn@@ thesizer .

before you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; you will need to install the program of navig@@ at@@ cher and correct . see also :
during the first start of kt@@ ops or while still no speaker is set up , the ticket card is displayed . see also if you have at least one speaker , the ticket card is displayed . see .
most T@@ TS syn@@ thesizer offer various languages and voices , such as different male or female , or such that distinguish themselves in volume or speed . you can also use several variants for a syn@@ thesizer . you can use at least one speaker before you try &amp; kt@@ ts ; because the program speed @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher otherwise used the standard speaker .
several speaker for the same syn@@ thesizer are comparable with several prints for the same printer .
if you click on the box credit card spokes@@ man , the card reader will appear . this appears automatically if you start the ts@@ .@@ gr and no speaker is set up .
all of the actors appear in this list . the preferred speakers appear above in the list . the top speaker is used for voice output when an application has no speaker .
in a single click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list .
with a mouse click a speaker from the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below .
in a single click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to push the speaker in the list a line further down@@ wards . the order of the speaker in the list also determin@@ ate its priority .
Click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; kt@@ ts ; system .
select an tuning type , there are three male and three female voices , as well as a Jun@@ gen@@ - and girls vote .
if you click here , appears on the new speaker on the box card speakers . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit .
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; already almost use . go back to the map card General and check whether your language output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . see . now , you can read &amp; kt@@ ts ; Click to create text messages to create text applications and manage text . see .
if you have at least one speaker , you can start the language output system by &amp; K@@ DE . Click on the map card General to open this card card . here you can set up some general options .
mark this check box to activate the &amp; kt@@ ts ; this is the beginning of this start , and you can create text applications and read text applications . see . remove the marking , K@@ TT@@ SD is activated and the T@@ TS system is de@@ activated by &amp; K@@ DE ; de@@ activated .
when the m@@ gr is terminated , it runs &amp; kt@@ ts ; further , if the field is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
if the check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr automatically appears in the system range of the control panel , it dis@@ appears once the advance is complete .
with the buttons in this series , you can launch text applications , stop and hold it again .
with the buttons in this series , you can read the latest text in the &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ clip@@ board . you can also read the speaker for a job .
Click on User &apos;s or OK , then all changed settings on all sides are taken on .
the ticket orders will only be displayed if K@@ TT@@ SD was launched . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the map card General and cross the language output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; K@@ DE , you can read the text of the displayed website . check out the text to read the text , and select the main menu tools . after a short time , the language output should start .
it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a website . you can also sk@@ ip this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; pre@@ st@@ resses and other invisible brands are also read .
in &amp; Kate ; the extended text editor of &amp; K@@ DE , you can read the text . check out the text , which shall be read , and select the main menu Tools Text . then the language output should start .
this also works if &amp; Kate ; in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; .
K@@ emergency is the news system of &amp; K@@ DE , which you will notify you of the specified events . you can also read the text of this news from &amp; kt@@ ts .
in &amp; conversation ; the I@@ RC program of &amp; K@@ DE , you can set up various kinds of messages . you can notice &amp; conversation ; for example , if you proceed in an I@@ RC channel , in which your nickn@@ ame is present . you can then read the I@@ RC news text .
supports a &amp; K@@ DE ; Program K@@ Not@@ ification , a menu entry should appear in the menu settings of this program . the possible settings for the emergency is different depending on the application .
filter to the character set offer a good possibility to correct &amp; kt@@ ts ; is a good example . it is a good example . remove the tags b@@ r and b out of the news that can be sent by mail , and also the expression / local / In@@ box , as it can be assumed in most cases . read also .
filters are one of the advanced abilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
in Fil@@ ters , text will be edited , before he sent to the program of the dispute , to replace wrong words or ab@@ brevi@@ ations , select a matching language and speakers , or to b@@ yp@@ assing certain defic@@ ien@@ cies of language syn@@ thes@@ izers and their voices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to understand the work of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tre@@ ble @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; distingu@@ ishes four types of texts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the output of Screen Re@@ a@@ dern has the highest priority . it will be presented to all other entries and holds these orders . if the output of the Screen Reader is read , the received orders will be resumed .
war@@ nings have the next priority . this level is important messages such as &amp; eg ; processor is too hot . a warning sign and holds the issue of messages and norm@@ ative text . these orders will be resumed after the warning of the warning .
News have the next priority . a message is subject to normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . during you &amp; eg ; you can read a long text on a website , you can use &amp; k@@ mouth ; someone welcome who just enter the room . &amp; K@@ DE ; alerts are also news . read it .
the rest are simple text applications . every job , which you use from the map ticket orders is a text order . KS@@ ay@@ it is an example of applications that use text applications . text orders are intended for issue longer texts that have no special dr@@ ing@@ ness .
all four orders will be processed in qu@@ eu@@ e @-@ long , with the exception of the issue of Screen Re@@ a@@ dern . if an application sends the output of a Screen Re@@ aders , whereas &amp; kt@@ ops ; just such reads , this issue will hold and finished .
first you need to know that filter never be applied to the output of Screen Re@@ a@@ dern . they are applied to normal war@@ nings , news and text applications as well as &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ News applied .
filter edit the text and give it on the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are done as modules . in the future , there can be further types of filters .
substitute pieces of a text to be replaced by other text , which can be used either as words or as regular expres@@ sions such as : - ) by text or for the conversion of messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better comprehen@@ sible form permit .
&amp; XML ; trans@@ duc@@ ers use a X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML , Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from a format into another format . delivery of &amp; X@@ HTML ; some X@@ SL@@ T files are included in the translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ;
with spokesperson , you can depend on the content of the text , depending on the program , sent to the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; if you have set a female voice , you can read text by K@@ DE @-@ News about it .
each of these different filters are adjustable rules , after which it is used for a voice output . if the filter ensures that its rules does not exist , he gives the text unchanged at the next filter .
if a text order , a message , warning , or a &amp; K@@ DE ; notification shall be sent and sent them through all activated filter that are set down on the page below . processing by the filter takes place in the list from top to bottom .
this shows the list of normal filters . is a filter not enabled , it is not enabled , and is not used . filter will be turned down from top to bottom .
Click here to insert a new filter . select the type of the filter , and it will be shown below the following alignment dial@@ ogues .
in a comparison list of words or regular expres@@ sion@@ ists you need to enter a list of words or regular expres@@ sions as a comparison list . these samples are exchanged in the text , then the text is exchanged for the associated replacement text .
enter your filter a name . for this name you can choose or choose from the name of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expres@@ sions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the string in column in accordance with the character set out of the column . the list is incorporated in the displayed order from above .
Click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list .
with this buttons you can download a list of words or regular expres@@ sions from a file sharing the current list or delete . download a list from a file , the entries from the file would be attached to the existing list .
here is a language registered here , the filter is only applied when the speaker for the text order is one of the languages . Click here to select a list of languages . you can also select several languages if you click the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l click .
here is a value registered here , the filter is only applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter several programs separately by Kom@@ mat@@ a . example : conversation , k@@ mail
the application ID running programs can be obtained with the q@@ d@@ bus program ; the &amp; D@@ bus ; numbers must be b@@ lown down . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID cop@@ ete @-@ 34@@ 32 may only be displayed .
the string filter filter is then applied to the text if all conditions are used with an entry in the box . apply . all input fields is empty , the filter will be applied to all texts .
when using words , the string filter is used for regular expres@@ sions in the form \ \ s word \ \ s. the words must be limited to both sides ( spaces ) .
in this manual you will find no instructions for writing and press . if you have installed the &amp; K@@ DE ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions are displayed in the package .
&amp; XML ; trans@@ duc@@ er translate &amp; XML ; using X@@ SL@@ T files from one format into another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3C standard for such conversion . however , it can only be installed on well @-@ shaped XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program must be installed on your system .
enter the path for x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c can be reached via the ambient @-@ variable Path , also x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is also available .
using the speaker , you can send texts to a specific speaker , which is set up on the map speaker , or at a speaker with certain properties . you can define that texts by k@@ mail should be read from a female voice . see .
before &amp; kt@@ ts ; a text on the filter is looking for a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected using the speaker , sending the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; and the characteristics of the speaker spokes@@ man can be selected to the selected speaker .
here is a value specified here , the filter is applied , if the text is installed , if the text is installed on your system of &amp; K@@ DE ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions , you can call this with one click on the button to get help when entering the input .
to achieve a faster processing , you should try to an@@ ew the regular expression at the start of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
place the characteristics of the desired filter conditions . if the text is displayed on the top shown filter conditions , the speaker will be selected to display the desired requirements on the h@@ ott@@ est . Click on the button right to display the dialog box .
use these buttons to store your microphone settings or to delete all settings .
the Inter@@ phone filter is only applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the Box Di@@ esen filter if necessary . you must be at least 1 condition .
the language output API , by &amp; K@@ DE , with the programmer to give their applications T@@ TS capabilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; D@@ Bus ;
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , added to K@@ TT@@ SD , allowing you to use &amp; kt@@ ops ; this syn@@ thesizer can be used .
the following section includes a short description of the &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; interface of voice API from &amp; K@@ DE ; the full documentation for both AP@@ Is you can find at K@@ DE ; Acc@@ essi@@ bility website ( h@@ tt@@ p : / / bil@@ bil@@ it@@ y.@@ k@@ de.@@ org ) .
applications require voice information about the &amp; D@@ bus ; interface by &amp; K@@ DE ; from the program to the object K@@ speech .
here is a text to read and option to read a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc .
there are even more commands that you can use . for a list of all commands
open two &amp; console ; -@@ window . start the following window in a window , then Arctic m@@ gr in the other .
none of the af@@ o@@ rem@@ enti@@ oned voice syn@@ thesizer supports my language . where can I get syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
I have set the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ circum@@ ference filter , but when using the module for festival are not read yet .
due to an error in the Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you need to install the ( male British ) voice Rab _ di@@ phone , allowing you to do this voice to read from websites . do also make sure that the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is installed and can be found on the ambient variable Path .
certain characters or inter@@ point signs seem to create mist@@ akes in syn@@ thesizer , so all propositions are sk@@ ipped or just Cau@@ der@@ sch . what can I do ?
first , make sure the option of character encoding is set to the correct language . there &apos;s problems with certain characters or words , this may be fixed by a string filter . see .

K@@ T@@ TS has also been working with any voice synthesis on the command line in a &amp; console .
the list of the above languages can be in@@ complete or ob@@ sol@@ ete . drag the description of syn@@ thesizer to the supported languages . look also on the website of kt@@ ts ; , according to information , which are not included in this manual .
the program &quot; tre@@ ble @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; is using a custom@@ iz@@ able module architecture for voice syn@@ thes@@ izers . if you want to expand &amp; kt@@ ts ; for the use of any other syn@@ thes@@ ia you would like to work with the Developer team .
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; it is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the command ap@@ t @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
to comp@@ ile &amp; kt@@ ts ; you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or later ) including packages to deli@@ bs and the programming files for the program &quot; of @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot;
if you have downloaded the source code of &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source text archive for col@@ de@@ cryp@@ bility or have downloaded the program created by Tar@@ ball , or install the program with the following commands :
before you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; check first if they are with your language syn@@ thesizer with your voice syn@@ thesizer . you can use the Sh@@ ell@@ scription SPD @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ ops ; in &amp; K@@ DE ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ops . this program is to be developed further , that the program of tre@@ ble @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher is supposed to be possible and the script SPD @-@ conf is no longer required .
a long text is dismant@@ led in single sentences . the user can return or leave the issue or break the issue .
if one use text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; for example , you can choose the properties of the preferred speakers for the issue . if you want to know a female English speaker , if you want to know a female English speaker , if you want to learn more about it , how &amp; kt@@ ts ; if you want to know more about it , see how &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can see it in .
if you click on the map speaker , click on adding a speaker to the list or click Edit , the box card configuration is displayed . as an example , please refer to the establishment of the module for Festival Interactive . details on the modules can be found below .
enter the path to the detailed festival program . if the path is contained in Path in Path , you must only enter the festival .
select the string coding for text , which will be handed over to the festival . for voices , the &amp; kt@@ ts ; known , this setting shall be made automatically . generally , Western languages are using ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these sli@@ vers , volume , microphone speed and pitch of synthetic language . if you cannot select some kno@@ b and be displayed , this grey allows you to choose the selected voice of these settings .
some votes like Multi@@ Sy@@ n votes will be loaded in size several seconds due to their size . when using this check box , these voices will already be loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so that the first set will be syn@@ ced faster at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD .
if this check box cannot be selected , you have no speaker furnishings ( or forget to click on the user ) .
if this check box is displayed on the start of the program window . otherwise , after the start , only the icon m@@ gr in system construction is visible , but not the program window . Click on the icon in the system stage to display the program window .
if this check box is not selected and doesn &apos;t work , it appears in the system range , once K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . thus , you have the possibility to read or to control the device .
here are all orders placed in the qu@@ eu@@ e , together with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of phr@@ ases and the straight set . the speaker ID corresponds to the ID on the card reader .
with the buttons in this series you can find a full @-@ trip in the list which is selected in the list below , proceed or return . ( but not every job is composed of several sets ) .
with a click on OK all the modifications of the settings ( also on other cardboard card ) will be resi@@ zed and resi@@ zed to the symbol of the system stage . Click on this icon to view the program window .
if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the audio card audio .
here only text orders are listed and managed . editions of Screen Re@@ a@@ dern , War@@ nings and News are not displayed . further information about the news types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; find in .
select the type of audio output . if a component can &apos;t be selected , &amp; kt@@ ts ; either without support for the corresponding audio module , it can &apos;t load the necessary libraries .
if G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de is to be used for the audio output , select the audio output . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you must select at least one module , select the PCM unit . see also
set the speaker speed here . 50@@ n@@ bsp ; % corresponds to approximately half and 200@@ n@@ bsp ; % about the double normal data speed . thus these settings can be implemented , the program SO@@ X must be installed .
Click on User to take the new settings for the running &amp; kt@@ ts ; -@@ System .
the list of AL@@ SA devices comprises all PCM devices and modules which are set up in your system . you need to find out what device works with you . in doubt , select standard .
on this cardboard card you can set special actions , which will always be executed if the text order will be interrupted by a good priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four kinds of language contracts :
the output of Screen Re@@ a@@ dern has the highest priority . it will be drawn up to all other entries and holds these orders . after the output of the screen Reader was read , the requested orders will be resumed .
war@@ nings have the next priority . this level is important messages such as &amp; eg ; processor is going to hot . a warning will keep the issue of messages and norm@@ ative text . these orders will be resumed after the previous year .
News have the next priority . a message is subject to normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks messages . if you &apos;re reading &amp; eg ; just a long text can read on a website , you can welcome you with &amp; k@@ mouth ; but any@@ body you can ride the room .
if a message is interrupted by a message , warning , or issue of a Screen Re@@ aders , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output in the qu@@ eu@@ e is a long time .
this audio file will always be played when a normal text file is interrupted . if both introductory sound is active as well as introductory message , the introductory sound is played before the introductory message .
the settings on this map map are only valid for normal text applications . for news , war@@ nings and the editions of Screen Re@@ a@@ dern there are no special promotions if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority .
to start with &amp; kt@@ ts ; K@@ emergency @-@ messages are able to start and click on alerts . the ticket card alerts appear .
mark this check@@ box to switch the advantages of &amp; K@@ DE ; dis@@ ables . if this setting is not marked , the other settings are disabled and write ; read no alerts .
if this adjustment is marked , alerts are to be recorded , where a sound is played , of &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read .
use this buttons to add the events to add or delete it . if you click on the button , a dialog , where you can select the application and the event you want to add to list .
this event reads the message before , the &amp; conversation ; sent , if someone is mentioned in a I@@ RC message for your nickn@@ ame .
all events , for which nothing stated in the list is given by &amp; kt@@ ts ; ign@@ ore it .
use this select field to determine what &amp; kt@@ ts ; should if an event hits . you have the following selection options :
if you have set custom text , enter the desired text . you can use the following plac@@ eholder :
you can also enter the properties of the desired speaker . standard elec@@ ts the speaker that is shown on the list on cardboard card as top of the selected entry .
note that there is three levels for events . if the action is set for a specific application , this will be executed . otherwise , the action is specified for any other events of specific application . as last option , the action is specified for carrying , which was specified under standard ( all other events ) .
the event All noti@@ fications for the application Standard ( all other events can not be deleted from the list . you can define the application folder as follows :
use the button Save to store the settings for the alerts . if you want to download the settings of a file . if you want to start saved settings in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries except any dis@@ closure will be deleted .
the speech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3C standard to mark text for a voice output . this standard contains brands for control of voices , gender voice and sound level . furthermore , SS@@ ML is a part of Vo@@ ice@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3C standard .
currently &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
you need to install the Rab _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) , since this is the standard one that uses the festival of SS@@ ML .
if the settings for speed or pitch in the Festival configuration dialog is not set to 100@@ n@@ bsp ; % , SS@@ ML text is usually very mon@@ ot@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; &lt; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UTF @-@ 8 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &gt; &lt; !

there are two types of filters - normal filters and proposition identification filter ( SDS ) . S@@ B@@ Ds must be able to start reading , not the whole text order . thus , you can also jump or stop or stop and break , even if the voice syn@@ thesizer did not support them directly .
here you see the proposition identification filter . for the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts ; it is automatically set to set up a set @-@ limit@@ ing filter . you can change its settings or any other proposition identification filter , but will be re@@ compens@@ ated by it .
at the sim@@ pl@@ est you will learn how to read the microphone selection and enter text . turn the speaker selection again , change some features and check how the selection of the speaker has changed , and you have to have set up more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; then faster with the suggest@@ ing can start , since the first set must be processed and not the whole text block that can take very long ,
they will keep track orders directly on the map card orders or termin@@ ate , even if the language syn@@ thesizer does not support this function .
for these reasons , the normal pro@@ positi@@ onal filter filter is automatically set up when you start the ts@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be removed only . do not change anything on this filter , unless you do what you do .
amendment of bound@@ ary filters compare text with a regular expression for pro@@ positi@@ onal sign ( dec@@ im@@ al@@ code 8 ) to the pro@@ positi@@ onal sign ( dec@@ imal number 8 ) in front of the fil@@ tering automatically from the text . note that the standard movement filters will retain the character sequences .
S@@ BD filter never be applied to &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ News ( cra@@ y@@ fy ) , war@@ nings , messages or the output of Screen Re@@ a@@ dern .
if you have removed the normal pro@@ positi@@ onal filter filter , you can add this again by clicking the file standard _ sb@@ ad@@ c .
on the card ticket selection , you can over@@ write the microphone settings for application . the card card is displayed if
use of the standard speaker ( the top on cardboard card speakers ) . with other words , no microphone properties are specified .
use of the appropriate speaker , which shows all the properties of the speaker &apos;s speaker . if you choose the settings of the speaker , choose or edit . otherwise , select &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker from which the most frequently used properties is equal .
select the method to input the desired speaker properties , click on one of the selection buttons .
select the features of the desired speaker . if this feature doesn &apos;t play any role , enter nothing .
mark this check@@ box when the feature priority is to have other features . you can also set multiple markings .
since the language is a critical factor in the issue of issue , this is becoming increasingly being used as a pre @-@ level property . if you might want to specify the attri@@ bute language , if you may know that a specific application text is set in another language as being introduced in the working environment .
to use all the properties in the field of speaker , which corresponds to the following commands , click on the selection button standard and then on speaker , which corresponds to the following .
in this case there stands 0 for the last text order in the qu@@ eu@@ e . you can also specify a order number . ( without the order number , input 0 is required ) .
rect@@ um cr@@ ashes immediately , when it is started . I compiled Deb@@ ug support , but I don &apos;t get tra@@ ce@@ able .
G@@ stre@@ amer is ev@@ okes and t@@ ect@@ ts ; probably you need to register G@@ Stre@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x is the command @-@ register @-@ 0.8 . if the problem is not solved , is possibly a compatible version of G@@ stre@@ amer . you can update G@@ stre@@ amer to update or un@@ install .
the audio output over AL@@ SA does not work when I &apos;m playing with another application music . if I get a text order , fri@@ es &amp; kt@@ ts ; one . on the &amp; console ; a message appears on the L@@ open PCM .
on your system , the problem is that conflicts in AL@@ SA , which can prevent a simultaneous opening of several PCM devices . information for possible solutions can be found on the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) under www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ pro@@ ject@@ .org .
I have installed an additional voice for the festival from the Internet . I installed them and can do them in Festival , but t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr shows this voice not .
add in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / Con@@ ven@@ d / Con@@ ven@@ d / Con@@ ven@@ d / Con@@ tractor the new voice . if this is successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL ; that you have found the voice to the developers .
on the controller audio , there is a setting speed . so this works , the program SO@@ X has to be installed and about the ambient @-@ variable Path . some syn@@ thes@@ izers , such as Festival Interactive also offer setting up a set of speed . depending on the chosen voice , this active is active or in@@ active .

Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thesizer , whose source code is obvious . the quality of the votes is generally good , and there will be several voices and languages . in many voices , you can provide volume , microphone speed and pitch .
you need to install at least one language . help with the instructions to be delivered with the festival . would you like to read web pages , you need to install the ( male British ) voice Rab _ di@@ phone .
for these voices , you must comp@@ ile an additional module , therefore you need the source code of festival . the German voices are subject to limitations during transfer .
this voice sets the festival 1.@@ 95 beta or newer . the voice is still in an early development stage . if you set the Russian voices , you need to enter the voices ms@@ u _ ru _ n@@ sh _ di@@ phone . choose a k@@ yr@@ illi@@ c ( 8 bit ) coding as for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .

this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; kn@@ et@@ work@@ conf ; a module for the &amp; controller ; that allows the administration of the network interfaces , routine and DNS settings .
the &amp; controller center ; allows users to manage a series of system and desktop settings via a unified , integrated surface . the &amp; controller can be called by selecting the K Menu control@@ center ;
the &amp; kne@@ eling conf ; package has been developed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; controller ; create the areas of &amp; kne@@ eling conf ; create a simple surface for the following tasks :
after installing a new module network settings in the &amp; controller center ; the module network settings ( kn@@ et@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be launched by selecting the controller ; Internet &amp; network network settings in &amp; k@@ menu .
it is important to understand that &amp; kne@@ eling conf ; network hardware cannot install . physical devices and their drivers have already been working properly installed and configured to configure &amp; kn@@ et@@ work@@ conf ; the device appears at all and the settings of the network properties are enabled .
in most cases , drivers for the network hardware and other devices are installed on the Install &amp; Linux ; with installed and set up network devices later , the drivers have to be loaded using the following files , according to the kernel version , as follows :
the module network settings will be loaded when the network settings will be selected in the &amp; controller center ; starting on the module &apos;s network settings , this system used to automatically detect the platform on the system .
if the platform cannot be recognized , the hands of the list is offered . it &apos;s the platform from the list , which the distribution and the release is best . due to the setting of the network settings , this selection will be set automatically pre @-@ set to the next start of the network settings .
the change of network settings are only possible in system management mode . previously , all the options are displayed gray , which means the settings can only be considered . in the system management mode , you can only be found in the system management mode at the right end of the module . it is necessary to input the password .
the total functionality of the module is available in the system management mode . this is divided into three riders :
the rider network interfaces for the management of the system . all available network devices are displayed . by rider network interfaces , the following tasks can be carried out :
the displayed network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button interface ... in the dialog box .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . clicking the button , click the dialog with further options .
the TCP / IP settings can be collected from a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , TCP / IP information is required for the system at any system start . in the selection list , the TCP / IP settings can be selected either . in the selection list , either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP can be selected according to the system .
the TCP / IP address can be made without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . in the input field IP address , the TCP / IP address must be specified . in the input field network mask is set to set the sub@@ net mask .
if this setting is marked , the system initi@@ alized the system &apos;s network interface . if the initi@@ alization is not allowed , this option should not be activated .
the values specified in this dialog will be shown as the properties of the device in the device .
it should be ensured that the IP address is not already used in the network . the input of an already existing IP address would result in a TCP / IP conflict . you can notice whether the address is already in use . in doubt the network @-@ administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or switched on or switched off . switching on one @-@ off network device is enabled by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface ....
network devices can be activated or switched on , or switched off . turn off an activated network device by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface ....
specifies the IP address of the data in the local sub@@ net that convey@@ s the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ networks .
if the computer is more than a network interface , the interface must be selected to the net where the gateway is selected .
a computer with DNS support replaces the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the computer h@@ tt@@ p : / / www.@@ en@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS will dis@@ solves this name into an IP address such as 12@@ 3.4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the calcul@@ ator for the name resolution part of the horse name resolution enables easy access to this list . entries can be removed or altered wer@@ .@@ DNA entries may be up or down in the list with buttons up or down in the priority .
by clicking the button 1 ... from the group calcul@@ ator to the name resolution , a DNS server can be added . it is shown in the New Nam@@ es@@ er@@ ver dialog .
first you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the button . the entry is then inserted in the list .
from the group calcul@@ ator to the name resolution , select a entry and then click Edit button .... It will editing the dialog .
the list of well @-@ known calcul@@ ator describes computer @-@ to @-@ IP address references for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used on bo@@ oting , if no DNS server are available . in small , completed networks can replace it DNS server .
usually , the list contains some entries that support &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IPv6 addresses . this still should be replaced in the Test version of IP should be replaced in the future version 4 .
enter the IP address of the well @-@ known computer and click .... The New Testament dialog box will be displayed .
Click the name of the familiar computer and click the button . if the well @-@ known calcul@@ ator has several also known as @-@ names , de button add several times and enter the further alias @-@ names .
select a well @-@ known data from the list and select Edit .... The dialog to edit your computer .
one of the following tasks can be executed , then with clicking on OK , the list of static hosts will be updated .
the settings included in the module &apos;s network settings are not immediately effective in the system . to activate the changes , in a &amp; console ; the following command must be set .
the homepage of &amp; kn@@ et@@ work@@ conf ; is h@@ tt@@ p : / / kne@@ eling conf@@ ection@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , from which you can download the newest version of the source text .
for installation of binary distribution boxes ( usually rpm packages ) it is enough if &amp; K@@ DE ; and Q@@ t is installed .
the installation of the finished version is recommend@@ able for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and in a &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
alternatively a tool can be used with graphical surface such as a package or the installation tool of their distribution .
for this case the installation of Q@@ t and K@@ DE ; not , but in addition , the development packages are needed with libraries and other things .
this is only experienced users to comp@@ ile . it is not difficult , &amp; kne@@ eling conf ; add the following commands to comp@@ ile this .
the first section of this cap@@ els are given important information about basic network technology , in the second , all of &amp; kn@@ et@@ work@@ conf will be discussed .
this section may not replace more information about IP networks . in this app@@ endix , only basic information about the integration of the PC in a small ( home use ) network .
currently , IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IPv@@ 4 ) . IPv@@ 5 has never expected big spread . this description focuses on the widespread IPv@@ 4 .
one of the most important information is the knowledge to as@@ sign IP address of a network interface . in strange networks , am &amp; eg ; workplace is the network administrator can be used or if available , D@@ H@@ CP can not be selected , if the IP address can be easily selected !
when using a private small ( home ) network , the IP address is provided for this purpose , to avoid IP address fli@@ ck@@ ering with the global ( internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not rel@@ ayed on the internet , therefore it is any use .
of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be made by setting a g@@ at@@ ew@@ ays .
for smaller networks , usually used addresses in the range from 192.168.@@ 1.1 to 192.168.@@ 1.@@ 254 . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set on 255.@@ 255.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all the computers are in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .0.0 and 12@@ 7.0.0@@ .1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own computer ) . the default route is required for the IP res@@ line .
the Internet address 12@@ 7.0.0@@ .1 is reserved for IP traffic in local own machine . usually , the address 12@@ 7.0.0@@ .1 is an own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface which works like a closed circle .
in this part , the configuration files that are affected by &amp; kne@@ eling conf ; and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions .
this file is dynam@@ ically modified with DSL connections , so it is not surprised if in the event of active DSL connections , another content is set to be specified there .
for &amp; SuSE ; it is known that this file is sorted by scripts by scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config . another state can therefore occur .

&amp; dat ; is a security program for tape on the basis of t@@ ar . it also offers the opportunity to create multiple archives on a band . the second goal was to answer a question that my wife introduced : how much longer lasts , if you are sec@@ ures ?
before a band can be used , it must be bound by &amp; dat ; it can be done on three ways :
&amp; dat ; do the band back and read the pre@@ st@@ ressing of the ban@@ des . recognizes &amp; dat ; the sp@@ ell on the band will not be asked if the band should be format@@ ted .
recognize &amp; dat ; the advance , looking for the matching index on your disk . can &apos;t be found , you will be asked if the Band@@ index is to be created .
everything is smooth , changing the symbol for the tape drive , to show that the band was bound . in the status bar a corresponding message appears . the content of the tape can now be searched for the tape .
before the thro@@ wing of the belt , initially the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to apply this :
&amp; dat ; gives a change of symbol to the band that the integration for the band was solved and shows an appropriate message in the status bar . the band can now be cast without any danger .
before a band of &amp; dat ; may be used , it must be format@@ ted by &amp; dat ;
a band types must be format@@ ted before using data . this process does not correspond to the storage of data . this procedure must not be format@@ ted before using the band by &amp; dat ; the flo@@ ppy disk drives cannot be format@@ ted . flo@@ ppy disk drives do not require a form@@ att@@ ing of the band , D@@ AT drives on the other hand .
after entering the band called and the capacity , the band will continue . all data on the band are lost ! after completion of the process , the band will automatically be mounted , and is ready to use .
before you asc@@ ending the backup process , you must select the required files . this can be done on three ways :
select a file or folder in local file tree . only this file or folder will be secured .
mark a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile shall be secured .
mark files in local file tree with a skins . only the selected files and / or sub @-@ folders are secured .
Click with the right mouse button on the local file tree and choose from the menu .
once the backup was initiated , the dialog opens up for backup . in this dialogue you can test the selected files and change the settings for backup .
if you have confirmed the settings , the dialog box backup . the dialog shows the progress of the backup process including the data rate and the remaining time .
select a file or folder in one of the Archive for the drive . it is checked for the selected file or folder .
mark the files in one of the archives created in one of the archives . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folder will be tested .
Click with the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu entry ....
once the test procedure was started , the dialog for Settings appears . in this dialogue you can check your selection and check the work file for checking .
if you confirm the settings for checking , the dialog appears . this dialog shows the progress of the test process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
before you can manage the re@@ produce , the files must be recovered . this can be done on two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives which belong to the entry for the tape drive . only the selected file or sub@@ folder will be restored .
mark the desired files from one of the archives with a Hä@@ k@@ chen . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folder will be restored .
with the right mouse button on a file or folder in one of the archives and choose from the menu ...
once the restore process was started , the dialog for recovery . in this dialog you can check your selection and check the working folder for restoration .
if you have confirmed the settings for restoration , the dialog appears . this dialog shows the progress of recovery process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
sometimes it is necessary to create the inde@@ x@@ ural file using the band &apos;s inde@@ xes . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this band . you can re@@ build the index on two types of tape :
this is provided by a backup profile with the just selected files and the default settings . you can use the following settings for a backup profile :
the current working folder where the backup should be made . the list of securing files will be updated automatically according to the specified work folder .
for all folders that are listed under backup files , that only the files are stored on the same file , such as the folder . file , which are on other file systems , you can add separately under backup files . each entry is considered by t@@ ar regardless of the others .
perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snap@@ shot file is secured . only the files have been backed since then .
the name of the file which is used to determine changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
del@@ etes the snap@@ shot file before the call of t@@ ar . this causes that all files are backed up and a new snap@@ shot file is laid for the next backup .
the functionality of kno@@ bs files &amp; gt ; and lt ; lt ; files was not completely implemented at the time of compilation of this documentation .
the settings can set you over the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the menu settings . the following settings can be displayed :
the complete path to device file for the belt drive ( normally / dev / T@@ ape ) . this path has to refer to the non @-@ re@@ winding option of the belt .
this setting is active , transmitted &amp; dat ; before the band is bound to the command . at some drives it is necessary to be performed before reading and write operations .
if the option is switched on , tried &amp; dat ; the exp@@ el to lock the tape . maybe this setting is not working with all band@@ ing drives .
if the option is switched on , when loos@@ ening the integration of &amp; dat ; automatically put the tape . use this option not at Flo@@ ppy Stre@@ am@@ ers .
if the option is switched on , try &amp; dat ; the hardware @-@ line block@@ size for the tape drive . no matter whether this adjustment is active or not , you must have &amp; dat ; in any case the block size for your tape drive .
when &amp; dat ; a band format@@ ted , it writes a file at the beginning of the band . this file should only show a memory block on the tape . the contents of the file is composed as follows :
( n ° ) The band @-@ ID . the format of this character sequence is computer name : second , whereby computer name of the system is format@@ ted on which the band is format@@ ted . seconds is passed since the ep@@ och in which the band has been format@@ ted .
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat / .
the remaining files on the band are pure t@@ ar @-@ archives created directly with &amp; GNU / - t@@ ar . even other t@@ ar versions should work as long as it is not related to incre@@ mental f@@ uses .
check the contents of a backup association . this symbol is only active if a band is mounted .
&amp; ks@@ log log ; is a &amp; K@@ DE . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users where you can claim information about your system or where the system is stored on your system , or where the system offers the various protocol files . furthermore it enables users access to quick access to information about problems that occur on their server .
&amp; ks@@ and@@ log ; helps users to understand what your computer makes in the background . the program is suitable for experienced users who can &apos;t know where you can access information about your system or where the system is stored on the various protocol files .
in addition , the system log@@ log ; experienced users to enable quick access to information about problems that occur on their server . &amp; ks@@ ystem log ; try to provide some advanced functions , filtered and evaluated the protocol files of certain programs and evaluated .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 &amp; ks@@ ellers log ; a number of useful features include :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba
many other features are also included in addition to the other chapters of this manual .
as you can see in the following screen photo , displays &amp; ks@@ ellers log ; functions can be easily fil@@ tering and sort the individual protocol lines of a protocol file easily and sort . the individual possibilities to sorting and filters will be shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after launching , &amp; ks@@ log log ; initially the most important protocol file of the system - the system protocol allows you to open a small news window , and it will be open under Linux in the file / var / log , for the normal user normally does not have permission to read .
you can also use the filter bar to fil@@ tering the filter bar according to the selected filter button . in the default setting , the selection box contains the entry list . in the default setting , the selection box contains only displayed , if in one of the columns the string of the filter search is included .
you can also select one other entry in this place . select the string process in the protocol process , and enter in addition to the entries in the filter Toolbar the name of a process , which shows you &amp; ks@@ ystem log ; all protocol lines , which were transmitted or created from this process .
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to detect the important protocol lines . protocol lines of level mist@@ akes are displayed with a consp@@ ic@@ uous color than Protocol lines of level notice . the color representation of protocol lines can be shut @-@ off .
if you want to display only certain process ( e.g. in the system protocol or in the cr@@ on Protocol ) , so you can examine the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the column process . this may be useful for example , if you would like to examine the issu@@ ance of the Sam@@ ba server . in this case , use filter bar .
furthermore , you can activate the option to the new lines in the context menu of the main window to display all new protocol lines .
&amp; ks@@ log log ; allows display of several protocol files in separate sub@@ windows . to open this function , use the entries in the window window to open and manage . once you select a sub @-@ window , select the menu to display a protocol .
&amp; ks@@ log log ; has a dedicated website to h@@ tt@@ p : / / ks@@ ystem log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softw@@ are@@ .@@ or@@ g. d@@ ort you find further information about the supply of &amp; ks@@ log log .

welcome to &amp; K@@ DE ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and in the following also called ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section leads a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ;
the system V In@@ it is quickly evol@@ ving to control the program starts when up@@ drive the system into the &amp; Linux ; world . therefore , because it is easier to use , more powerful and more flexible than the traditional BSD int@@ it .
I will not go further to historical aspects ( e.g. because I know nothing else : - ) .
the in@@ it bin@@ aries is under / s@@ am and not under / etc . this is therefore important because someone could try to set a machine on System V In@@ it without a re@@ install and new format . therefore , you need to make sure the old In@@ it was removed from there if there was there one .
the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it differs from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files in a sub @-@ folders of / etc are instead directly into / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following further folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole amount of scripts . basically you need to start a script for any system service , which do not need such things such as network , NFS , &amp; ship@@ mail ; , h@@ tt@@ p@@ d &amp; etc ; system services do not include such things such as offset serial that is only launched . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should lie down below / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even if it does not have any use of it . you can also run a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run something with the serial port .
the kernel is looking for different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first to find it .
the default Run@@ level is registered in / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab . you should see the following line as the following :
at this point you can cast a look at the second column and probably determine that the default Run@@ ning 3 can be carried out . if you want to change anything , then you can fix it , then you will repair the system by rest@@ art the system and execute the following :
but how does it start all the correct scripts ? if you enter -@@ l enter in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you will see something like the following :
you will notice that there are no right files in this folder . instead , each entry is here a link to one of the scripts in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d .
how to start and stops in@@ it actually system services ? simply : each of the script is so written that it actually accepts a argument like start and stop . you can actually start this script by hand on the command line :
this would hold the h@@ tt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if the one contains a K , the script will be accessed by the argument . if it includes a S , the script will start with the argument .
some people wish to create a simple way to create machines for many purposes . I could run &amp; eg ; a server running level , which can run only h@@ tt@@ p@@ d , &amp; shows ; , network &amp; etc . also , I could have a user @-@ running , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc .
here you can learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another poin@@ ter is simple to say tri@@ vi@@ al : simply drag an entry in the area of availability system services to one of the six running level to start it on this level ( or stop ) .
you can shift scripts between Run@@ lev@@ eling or modify the position within a level by taking it somewhere else . in this way , the entry is found out of its original Run@@ ning ( or his position ) . this happens only if they go an entry out of the price of the availability .
note : entries will be post@@ pon@@ ed if you want to select this in a new area . in order to select only on a new Run@@ ning menu , and then insert it in the target range -- even then , if the same entry exists in the target range of the action .
the sorting number of a entry can be sometimes not calculated . in such a case you need to edit the sorting numbers in the environments before you can try to insert the system service .
note : currently there are no possibility to restore entries that have been thrown into the paper basket . be careful .
you can use the Tab@@ ulator button to activate the various work@@ areas ( available system services , Run@@ ning 1 Start , Run@@ ning 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to make a selection of upper or below the previous .
to move into another running level , push it with cut into the clip@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and add it to the desired Run@@ level with insert ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) .
to change the sorting number or the name of a entry manually , press the button key to change the tab button . connect the dialog button to accept the changes in order to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to re@@ ject the changes .
because of the risk of data loss require all entries in the menu file a confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . def@@ aults to the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) , if it is available . otherwise they are stored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; changes to default settings are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I tried to experiment with the standard Run@@ lev@@ eling and now starts the machine resistant . what can I do ?
in l@@ ilo -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in single @-@ use mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab and change the standard running level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be in order ) .
I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for version under Run@@ ning X , but they are not performed .
if you use &amp; SuSE ; or Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) , you must process additional files in / etc , which are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of the distribution .
the way , such as system services started in these distri@@ butions , the configuration for propri@@ etary inser@@ ting programmes of this distri@@ butions is equal , but unfortunately no standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you are using another distribution : check whether all configuration files are available , which are required by the respective system service ( and also if they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache or h@@ tt@@ p@@ d ) just termin@@ ate when your configuration files are not available or false .
the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you use a different distribution , please send me information about Run@@ ning , that this manual can be added .
this documentation is based on &amp; user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the user and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; user ; it &apos;s enough to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; user ;
once you have made changes , you have to save this . either use the corresponding symbol of the tool@@ bar or entry to the entry in the menu .
&amp; user ; is an easy application . the main window consists of two cart@@ ography cards , the user and the use of troops . to edit the desired user or the desired group with a double click on the entry . it appears the dialog or group properties .
some cards are only displayed if you have extended system settings . only if you have advanced system settings , if you are able to set individual settings , if shadow pass@@ words appear if shadow pass@@ words or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d installed in BSD uni@@ forms .
the board card password will appear if shadow pass@@ words or such as / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d installed in BSD -@@ Unix .
this map card appears only if required for at least one hour &apos;s file system ( Qu@@ ota ) is enabled and initi@@ alize ( recogni@@ z@@ able at the file quot@@ a / quot@@ a group on the file system ) . here you can change parameters in each user , depending on the file size :
these parameters can be adjusted individually for each file system . the current file system is selected by means of the field file system
the map map groups informs about the selected user of the selected user . the standard group , to which the user belongs , can be found in the primary group . furthermore , the user can mark in other groups by increasing these in the large field .
the Group &apos;s dialog features a list of all users . to add a user to the group , mark this user in the list .
to add a user or a group , add from the menu users or group or click the matching button in the tool@@ bar button . the editing or del@@ etion of the selected user or the selected group will be analogue .
using this module , you can add the l@@ ilo boat manager , remove and change the time to boats of the standard operating system , remove the standard operation system , remove , change operating systems , change and more .
