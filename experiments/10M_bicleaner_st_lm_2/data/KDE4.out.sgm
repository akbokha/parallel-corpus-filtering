<seg id="153">What types of files fit together? the separation of file types makes the stack processing easier. split new from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and desktop files simplifies a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are searching for an original or derived image.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend to save the metadata option in the installation page of metadata in & digiplug; if you forgot this, then you can then select the metadata from the database to the files by clicking the corresponding item in the menu album.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change? it is & digiplug; they have a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are of course the most important.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now, the real work, since you should select any photo passwords, shriftings and an assessment. of course you can choose the same attribute and set the value. you can start at best with the rating or the rankings. this makes sense to focus on the best photos.</seg>
<seg id="158">Try us now with keywords, keywords, such as you often called in other programs. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">When you import Catalogised images from a different source of embedded keywords, then put the images to the right place. if you want to mount the images on the right place. if the passwords are done by & digious words; the changed passwords are pursued by & digis; updated while it is pursued.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphics shows how different metadata has overcut. this is a very rough representation since each block of metadata in truth is composed of many sections. file names and calendar data are features of all pictures.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough the keywords - the next section refers to shriftings or comments using the third important tool to catalogging your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You want to view most niemanden your photos just, you want to share them with your friends, your family, other photographers and agencies. they are sure interested in your photos.</seg>
<seg id="163">Look at this panorama. from the distance, it's not even a nice beach panorama. if you consider it closer, then start some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I tell you this of the landing area of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandy 60 years after landing, memories, the historical period is again present, you may even hear the silence, so you can hear your perception of this panoramic view.</seg>
<seg id="165">For other photos look, the title may be more important than the image itself. if you show pictures, you should tell a story. if you look, the key is to save the meaning of the viewer, to help you understand what you understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is fine if a picture is not perfect when it has the strength only to work with a label for yourself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digiplug; you can also export a lot of text, in an internationalised alphabet (UTF-8), then you can export it for a selection of images. if you want to export your images in the label and / or the title of the web Galeriessystem. you need to tell you the story so for the open plan no second time.</seg>
<seg id="168">Do you remember the times before GPS? as you had to find into another city without navigation system? was it wasn't a boring planet before Google Earth? well, because with pictures, the train departs of the spatial presentation is now available with light speed.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities of geolocalization can be inseparable. I'm sure that one day, in the near future, you can repeat the pictures at the recording. you can also export the pictures on the recording. you can also export the pictures by Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a word game with copyright and signifies the practice to use copyright and modification of copies. the same freedoms are also valid in all changed versions, so also for the work of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you what information in the installation page of & digicomes; as information should be deposited:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for narration and author): this field should add your name, or the name of the photographer, for example, if it is not desired to change the name of the photographer, then it should not be changed. this field does not support semi-mate nor semicolons as a separator.</seg>
<seg id="173">Car titles (synonymous with author): linked with the author. this field contains the work of the photographer. examples of this website contains title like: employee photographer, freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer. since this is a mermerk to the author field, this must be also completed.</seg>
<seg id="174">Editor (synonym for suppliers): do not use the picture below. if the photographer shall not be able to identify. if the photographer shall be listed here, which offers the picture below. if the image is a camp photo, then the picture is indicated here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections, although this does not have any protection against abuse, or change the solution for this problem. for individuals, this problem is only important for the majority of your photos. for professionals and half-professionals, this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique per image. & digiplug; in the near future, there will be such a module for stacking processing.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: plate error, turnouts, power failure, ECC, transfer error, aging of storage media, restoration, redundancy, circumstances, temperature, data size, widespread aberration</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course, we don't talk about CDs that were lost on the road or a fire. this type of losses are the same that you can do also at traditional paper photos or negatives. in this section, there are problems in the so-called New Media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll Ontrack, the world's largest data manufacturer company, has some interesting statistics which has a data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">In order to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs, you can do not have any more expensive than a few years. of course you can get CDs and DVDs in archive quality. of course, you can claim your CDs and DVDs in archive quality. of course, you can claim your lifetime of 100 years for themselves. if you have a lifetime of 100 years for itself.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD discs can be unreadable, but you can reduce this risk in which you can reduce good disks and good recording devices. best DVD recording tools are not much more expensive than the cheapest but you write a lot of reliable. it's the right to select the right.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very vulnerable for errors, even if you have just been written. therefore, we use a control mechanism to protect themselves. 75% of data are only required for formatting and control. despite this massive protection it is needed by chemical ageing, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc.</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CDs and DVDs, there is a convenient program called IsoBuster, which works on Windows and & Linux; but is not yet available for Macs. there are also similar applications that damaged data from damaged disk disks, HDDs, Flashmedia, USB drive, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray discs seem to win the format war against the HD DVD. a dual-layer Blu-ray disk can save 50 GB and thus says almost six times the capacity of a dual-layer DVD with 8.5 GB. everything was, of course, also for Blu-ray disk.</seg>
<seg id="185">Burn slowly with a good recording range of high-quality media in a non-proprietary format. if you are able to check out the media with a description, date & author and then check out the data to the next generation of media before using the last piece of hardware or software that can read this media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Disk manufacturers retain your statistics for themselves. their manufacturers guarantees a new disk, but not the data. Google has a large field study on the fault mechanisms of hard disks: disk missing</seg>
<seg id="187">In brief: discos at the longest, if you are operating in the temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C, this error rate can not determine the fault errors. some of SMART invaded errors. these are especially reading errors and publishing teeth. the expected lifetime of life is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is the complete losses due to overvoltage. of course, you can also have data loss due to a power failure before you have secured the files, but these losses are normally reproduce without large problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electric devices should not make a lot of electrical devices. these can take heavy damage in devices with computer chips and high-speed processes. these can cause severe damage, hardware components, motherboards and other defects. do not protect themselves before unavoidable that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">Most popular protection against power peaks is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that is absorbed and the rest. it is normally available in the form of a plug-in bar. remember that no plug-in connection also contains a overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you're looking for an overvoltage protection, then you should pay attention to the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a certain minimum of protection. it should also make sure that it protects protection against flash, and thus protects the correct devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">As a overvoltage can use each cable to your computer, you should make sure that all the peripherals can be connected to your system. some manufacturers represent overvoltage controllers also. others provide connection options for coaxial cable of the cable modems and the TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are specially developed for notebooks, and therefore also contain the protection for the modem. it is ideal for travelling.</seg>
<seg id="194">While an overvoltage protection in front of smaller variations in the supply lines, it will not really help you with a complete failure. even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of unbearable data. it may therefore make sense to invest in a interruptible power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to protect against overvoltages, these tools can be automatically shut down. if you purchase a UPS. if you buy a USV, you should be sure that they are the same quality requirements such as an overvoltage protection. furthermore, the life time of the battery and the supplied software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to and compare its safety at current costs to avoid such. a high-quality overvoltage protection can be used for less than & euro; 40. this is just a small price difference if you think so well. at the end, you should always think all cables to trash before you go into the holiday.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web Service includes S3 - simple storage service - a simple storage service. with the correct configuration, you can use this as the drive below & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to store this as backup destination for your software. Google Shared Storage is a further popular offer that you can save any quantity of data.</seg>
<seg id="198">They are very expensive compared to the hard drives, but very expensive - 40 GB cost & dollar dollar; 75 per year and 400 GB cost per dollar; 500. furthermore, you have to send the data about the comparatively slow Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore suitable only as a solution to a local data loss of the most important images. it is not a bad solution, but there is no general backup solution. it is too slow.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Yahoo), Flickr (Yahoo) and the Photo Community 23hq.com make online storage services that have no longer available to photos, in case of Flickr dramatic more. for $25 a year, you receive unlimited memories, which should be checked in reality.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the point of view of data backup, web solutions are very secure. transmission errors will be adjusted automatically adjusted by the TCP protocol and included in the large companies in the offer. therefore, they are desasterable.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the computer. all transfers are due to transfer errors. the file system cfs and bays are at least secure data integrity between operating system and hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing about it is that nobody said if this occurred in your hardware. all these disorders remain undiscovered until you should not have any protection against it. no one seems to have thought. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a significantly reliable data backup than that of your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are a further source for transmission losses, as they generate interferences within the data streams. in normal file systems this error is unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are currently affected by transmission problems, you should look into the future. in 2010, you will see thousands of errors per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS of Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates, which can be very scalable to low level and can be realized under one to GPL incompatible license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope for & Linux; and Windows available. read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has launched an own initiative with its btrfs filesystem. this is still in the alpha status. it uses the same protective mechanisms that is used and is also available for & Linux; but it's not part of the core.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not estimate that these two factors are responsible for 86% of the data losses on notebook and 46% for the workplace systems. in notebooks, the proportion of theft is already 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less widespread than the most expensive than thieves or new installations. it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users know only very few viruses and under & Linux; it was already no longer sighted.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open Source file systems are less susceptible to data loss as proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFs, JFS and XFS to call the common file systems.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss: wrong, only the speed of the investigating process during an surgery is higher and an undefined status is avoided. if a file is not completely stored before the problem is lost, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the biggest threats for digital data: false, theft and human mistakes are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">"" "sensors of digital cameras are 1-2 apertures from fundamental physical boundaries." "" "there is a natural limit for these advances. sensitivity and noise characteristics for all kinds of light sensors are not far away from this limit." ""</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras proceed in direction of 10 megapixelsensors. even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and the end result is the Optimum for Compact cameras. even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10-12 Megapixel. for higher resolutions you need a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or greater formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">A 750GB hard drive today will receive you today for 100 & euro; so that your data is often affected by any data loss. thus, your data is often affected according to a plan and test this backup before using anything like the reinstall of your operating system, exchange of disks or the size of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose your fuses on an external SATA drive daily. if, then one day, a flash strikes, you are lucky when the drive was not connected when the drive was not connected.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster strikes locally and destroys a lot. forget aircraft accident: fire, water, electricity, children and thieves are dangerous enough for your data. they usually affect an entire room or whole house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore Desasterance is always a non-local storage. bring your securities up the stairs, into the adjacent house, into your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of the physical separation: as mentioned above is a common cause for a data loss despite securing the panic. if you have a backup which is not immediately available, then you can save one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all the files are to be secured. it is a moment of view without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differential backup: the backup of the files have been changed since the last complete backup. generates a complete moment of short time points: the complete backup and the last differential pressure.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: one backup of the files have been changed since the last backup. you can restore the original status at any time again. this backup comes to a versioning system next to the next with the exception that it is only abgeted and not continuous.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful small tool that can easily be set up on your machines. in contrast to script-controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transmissions were copied. this happens if you want to increase security over ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Secure important pictures directly after you have saved them on your computer to a DVD or another optical medium.</seg>
<seg id="225">This approach takes you enough time to discover losses and restore life; 130% of the size of the work files. at the end you will have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly subscription for every month. every additional dilution should be done manually after which you have made a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata, stored in the image file stored IPTC information, associated XMP files, original, memory, scalability, media, re-finding images and metadata, copy the images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, visibility,..., use of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">In order to survive the next 40 years that, about the period of time in which you really interested in you, because you remember your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">Because the future is unforeseeable due to its nature. unfortunately, there is no other way to be able to leave. all 5-8 years you should ask yourself as the current system backward. if less variants you have used in the past, so it is easier to evaluate the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered by the explanations of this document. use or change the standards that are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is now available for everyone. if you have an old system that is important to reading your pictures, then keep it on and install it in a virtual machine for a later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the Council is quite easy: if you change your computer architecture, your memory and security technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary to convert any newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the expert pressure for the possibility to change a system in its size. this means it always increase.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's go out that you have scalability the scalability and put the area that you want to enlarge to a dedicated disk or partition. at * nix systems such as & Linux; can copy this area and store it on a new record:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check the command dmesg if your new record is detected by the system, but hang it not.</seg>
<seg id="235">& / / dev / SDC # Source can / dev / SDC # Source can be / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; size of the plate in MBens; # works with ext2,3, FAT16, 32 and reisfs & dollar / / dev / sadc1 # change the size of travelers if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open Source Standards have the great advantage of an open specification. even if a day do not exist any software more, then you can create it yourself. this task will be easier by year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that vanishes slowly from the market. you should not use it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG has been replaced as an open source standard to replace the GIF. it can't be fun, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, 16-bit per color channel and full transparency. PNG can be used as many as TIFF and has a slow compression. this format would like to store you for saving your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widely distributed as image format. TIFF can store images in uncompressed form or in a container with a lossless compression algorithm. a problem is needed to store your pictures in this format. there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The digital negatives file format is a licensed and open raw format that was developed by Adobe Systems. DNG has been developed because of the need to use metadata. a handful camera manufacturer is now available and we hope to use the competitors' Canon and Nikon.</seg>
<seg id="241">This is probably one of the reasons why to replace the & quot; Extensible Metadata Platformquot;, a mixture of XML and RDF. it is a key technology which allows users to make their data into a file itself. the file information is stored using the extension & quot; .xmpquot; saved the XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers go in front of the original of your recording, mostly archived in the shell format. however, it can view the metadata between the metadatendatei and the image file, and how it's possible to use the raw format. therefore, you should check whether you use your container as a container and put everything there.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organization designed for fully compatible online metadata standards. the activities of DCMI communities, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and explanatory efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import pictures from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. so long the pictures on the camera are, you can use it as a temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert tube files to DNG and store these in your raw archive. this function is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a sensitive work, you can use external programs. if you come back again with & digiplug; then you should add the metadata again. these were truncated under the circumstances of the other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the processed pictures for the copyright with a digital watermark. export it just then in web galleries, encode to MPEG, use in contact page, print & etc.</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digiplug. in the section, you can find a description as you can already add photos, which you can already add on your hard disk. the camera interface offers you many advanced settings for importing images to your Albendatenbank.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digiplug; connect this to the computer, switch the camera on the display mode and switch them. another description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">If you start the camera interface, this is trying to connect to your camera. if the connection is made, the filenames will be displayed on the lower end and the pictures will be displayed on the camera. if this is the case, the filenames will be displayed on any file, photos, movies, music, etc.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you can download the photos on your computer, you may need to see the camera information about each entry. with the lateral handles and metadata from the camera interface, you can see the characteristics of a entry or his metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog features file features and photo information that are internally stored by the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded on your computer. note that for some digital cameras not all information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The rider metadata shows the internal metadata like EXIF, manufacturer's specification, GPS etc. of the image. these information are the same as in the metadata sidebar in the main window of & digicame; or the image processing. please note that these metadata is not available for some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on their computer, is the click to download and then download the photos from their camera to a single album in & digi.. when downloading photos are not deleted and we recommend you to delete the photos stored in an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you don't want to download all photos, you can only select the desired document options of & KDE. once you select the photos. download the button. download the button as long as you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, is a option New Download. these pictures have now been downloaded from & digis. in this case, the new pictures have been selected with a star in the forewindow. if you select this option, only the new pictures will be downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">If you can download all the buttons, you can download or select a dialog with which you can select the target album, how to select the target album. details on the folder can be found in the section My albums. select the target album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After you have selected the target album, press OK, and & digiplug; the photos taken from the camera into the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete them from the camera. you can delete all of the camera by clicking the button. if you want to delete the button, then you have to select this first and delete any selection.</seg>
<seg id="260">Note that there are no opportunity to recover from the camera. you should not be deleted from the camera. if you want to delete the camera from the camera. if you want to erase the camera, you should make this camera over the camera, because it's much faster than the camera.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras are often used as filenames for the photos often. the filename are often utilized, after taking pictures from the camera. this may be useful to integrate photos from different recording galleries. hence, it can be useful, the date and time to integrate the filename in the filename.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section you will find options for turning and mirrors on the image and for date-based washers. if you use this latter option, you will automatically create a folder per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options During the transmission will open three further options, before the photos can be stored on the plate. if you select this, the corresponding entries will be copied from the EXIF data into the IPTC fields. with the last option, you can correct date & time for all downloaded pictures.</seg>
<seg id="264">For example, if you wish to use a different file format than the standard format, you can use the prefix photo -% Y-% m-% H:% S. turn the option date & time. for more adjustments you should read the help of the command time.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the camera filenames, you have the possibility to change the filenames in lowercase. or in case letters, if you prefer this.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new filename, the & digiplug; used for a photo, is below the name displayed when the camera is available in preview. its settings are saved and automatically used when you open the camera window.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digiplug; may use all information about the orientation of the camera to time recording, in order to perform automatic rotation during shutters. in the section of the metadata, you can read more details about the information that has embedded your camera in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic rotation is normally switched on, and if your camera will not provide you any information; the photo in the original orientation. if you want to turn off-off, use the knob and select the Automatic rotation in the lower part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera has been made information about the date you can download & digial. all images with the same date are uploaded to the same sub-album. all images with the same date are uploaded to the same sub-album. in the section sidebar data you can read that information your camera could be embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is normally switched off, and in this case stores & digiplug. if you want to change this option. if you want to change this option, use the knob and select the option file-based subsets at the lower end of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to download from their computer to their camera is the button. choose the file selection dialog & KDE; appears to select the files uploaded. you can also select more than a file with the standard & KDE; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the image selection is done, asks & digiplug; you where the pictures will be loaded too. select a folder selection dialog for the camera. select the folder and press OK to start the upload. the pictures will not be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document. this is a position that can be displayed on a map and can be displayed on a map. identifying the data can be carried out by American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European Galileo or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photography, it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographic place. it is not used to create an area through automatic recording of the GPS data. environmental planner, military, police, architectural office and real estate agents can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you have later forgotten, where the photo was made, you can open a postcard to another & digiplug; if you want to find a postcard to another & digiplug; users will send you to the place of the photos, or just to document this aspect, it is good to add the position data of a photos.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is how the GPS data is in the picture? first, you should know that exiv2 are supported in these fields? there are at least three ways to achieve this. directly with the correct hardware, via a reworking of the GPS data and image files with the KIPI module to geographical references.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know there is currently no camera that has a GPS unit. but there is a few who work with GPS receivers together. either as a card module or through transmission of the data with one cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">The GPS data from one device can be done with gpsman or gpsbabel. you need to save this data in GPX format, as this is the only format that is supported by the module to geographical references.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are various programs for & Windows; and Mac OS, that extract the data of pictures and from GPS. on the following page you can extract the same under & Linux;: gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you are using the length and latitude or other data, then you can use this script that works with the Exifted Analysis of Phil Harvey. it uses the sign-based coordinates, such as maps.google.</seg>

<seg id="300">In previous versions of & digiplug; image processing was only a picture viewer for photos. currently, it is currently developing a tool to manipulating your photos. with this dialogue you can change the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The default rate is that all green pixels are just like the pixels of the CCD sensor in sensitive to ultraviolet light, this option creates a bit soft, eliminates the 2x2 grid pattern with the VNG- or the AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white balance is used on the camera. otherwise, if set, the automatic colour balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used when the white balance is not set. standard is a fixed color balance that was photographed on a white map that was photographed in sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. the effect of the second sensors has the effect that underexposed images in four steps more details in the top-top. for other cameras this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The standard is the top-top, so the parts of your images are built, as a piercing white in various roatches. at least, you can try out some parts of the missing information from the top to redesign.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels generally do not satisfy as fast as green and red. & scraw, hence the missing green and red sharks are trying to redesign the missing blue pixels. of course, this is a question of how much color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you select the option, you get the possibility to set up a level. here is a value of three a compromise and can therefore be adjusted individually for any image.</seg>
<seg id="308">Put the Luminance value to your taste. you have to set him somewhat higher than the standard 1. however, this can also be made later in the image options of & digiplug; image processing is small. in order to hold the time for the Demosaicing, you should be conservative.</seg>
<seg id="309">A demo-speed algorithm is a digital image process to obtain a complete image from the partial image sensor which provides many cameras and is known as CFA-interpolation or colour construction.</seg>
<seg id="310">& digiplug; and Dcraw provide you three alternatives to me: Bilinear, VNG-Interpolation and AHD interpolation (variable number of gradient) was created. but it produces Farbartefacts on the edges. Bilinear is interesting if you are looking for a fast solution with an acceptable result.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the colour softening of your lentils you can set the red and blue correction values here. this is certainly the best method for a color correction, as you can conversion during the shell conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the color information and gives instructions as these again. there are also LCMS and digiplug; information as colour information from a colour space in the others are possible to translate the colors as exactly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behavior questions if a picture is opened in picture processing / color design module with raw files.</seg>
<seg id="314">Please click here the folder, such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / dev / ICC, in which you store all your profiles. & digiplug; studied this folder during the start.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of ICC profiles you have the possibility & quot; standard squash; for your profiles can be deposited for your profiles. everything can be changed when opening the pipe file later.</seg>
<seg id="316">The color design is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here, only your pictures are colorfully maintained by the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should be added to the camera manufacturer and model. not all profiles are contained on the same way. currently, dcraw Gamma are not included for conversions at 16-bit depth. this means that you need to perform the color mapping itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are further options such as the Soft-Proof-profile, which allows you to print a smaller colour range as your camera and some colors are therefore very satisfied as your camera and some colors are therefore very satisfied, rather than to leave on the blind algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras it is pretty obvious that colour profile with them is intended. unfortunately, a table of cameras and profiles do not fit together. this answer is of course unofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile extension leaves the style for the target: F for an accurate style, L for landscapes, N for Neutral, P for portrait and S for standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & KDE; image plugin interface. it is an interface that supports from a series of & KDE; image scoring and image processing is supported; many modules support, which are written to work with each program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>

<seg id="338">The image processing contains a number of tools to improve your images. some of them are available as modules in & digis; so you are not part of your distribution. more information about the KIPI modules can be found in the section image processing.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status line at the bottom edge of the window, the filename, current filenames, magnifying factor and current image size.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top edge and including the tool bar for quick access to the most common functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The machining functions of the image processing change your photos. no of the features will be used, but before you use File Save or button Save In toolbar. please note that you can't recover the original photo, as soon as you have saved the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">You should evoke a copy of your image before you change it. you can save it with file Save as possible.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can restore the original image by clicking the image editing in the toolbar. you lose any change that you have performed in the photo since the last store.</seg>
<seg id="344">Virtually any action of image processing can be restructured or recovered. the last action can revoke you by editing the editing or reproduce reproduce from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you often use this, you should make the keyboard abbreviation, Ctrl; -z to reproduce and Ctrl; -Umschalt-Z to reproduce reproduce.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you select the & LMB; in the toolbar for a moment you will last longer, you will get a context menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all promotions will be reproduced or recovered.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you started the image processing, you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by clicking the navigation buttons in the toolbar, image below or the entries in the menu. if you have any changes to the current photo, you will be asked if you want to save this.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can in the photo set and out in the ctrl; mouse wheel or symbols in the toolbar or the entries in the cautics menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To customize a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: magnification factor automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">View Full Screen Saver displays the photo in full screen mode. if you do not want to use the Esc key. if you like this, you can get this in the Settings dialog. if you like this, you can call it from the & digiplug; main window will call you. see the section to set the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current picture you can print out the image file image and get the default & KDE; printer dialog. you can customize the settings before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu, you can print individual images or whole sentences. you only need to select the images with the default methods and choose from the menu album export assistant. if you follow the assistants, you just need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The & digiplug; main window has a side panel on the right edge, which is important information and actions for the selected pictures. the same sidebar is available without the navigation use, even in image processing. it is displayed if one of the five riders is attached:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple Click on the same rider, the sidebar will appear and disappear again in the edge.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the loading view, you can enter shrivals with unlimited size or insert. the text is UTF-8 compatible. that means all special characters are allowed to be used in the EXIF- and IPTC- Fields, so that you can use other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data are limited to ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are cut off after 2000 characters. if you want to use the IPTC labels in other applications, you should consider this restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you commented on, use either the button users or change to the next image, the labels will then be stored.</seg>
<seg id="358">In addition to the user button there is a button More. with this you can read further metadata from the selected file or database. however, it is always carried out if you have selected a metadata setting, which is always written in the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="359">The section rating shows an evaluation scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting areas. it can always be used on a picture. in order to evaluate multiple images at the same time, select this out and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The evaluation is written in the IPTC field. the coding follows the scheme in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The search words shows a search box for filtering the keywords, the sampling and a selection box with the previously mentioned in this & digiplug; meeting session displayed.</seg>
<seg id="362">The sample tree becomes dynamically adjusted to the set search phrase. you can quickly restrict the number of possibilities in search of a keyword. this ability is especially useful if you have many words.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the lower end is a further relief during the input of keywords in a picture series. if you have entered different passwords, these are stored for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set in a tree by identifying the appropriate check boxes. all keywords are stored in the IPTC field keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If several images are selected in the main screen and select a keyword in the sample tree, this will only be applied to the entire selection, if you want a selection with a keyword, please read the sample section.</seg>
<seg id="366">The sidebar sampling filter is used to change images displayed in the main window. usually, the left side panel is used with their album, - date, search, search, search, search, search, search, search, and search results. all created passwords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also go to tags and place them. if the keyword has already exists, you can simply drag and set aside. if the keyword is already exists, you can simply pull it out of the right sidebar and put on the selection. then a dialog that you ask if you want to set the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example shows the images on a calendar day. the sampling filter is now reduced to three pictures. they were taken up with Ctrl + a, and later it was placed. a dialog asks if this keyword should be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes will take place at any start of the program. it can also be switched off on the settings.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created, notice that it should be one or his needs, you can easily change this with double click on the text and in the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): entry to which in the database is sought. this may be an album, name, keyword, image, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator, which is a name or a string that is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can define a Extended search for all the elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to grouped options, you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule, and then to use the button. the options then look as follows:</seg>

<seg id="377">The reason why you have a colorized workflow, which can be seen from your camera or scanner, you can reach the colors on your monitor from your camera or scanner and that the colours will publish it on your computer or scanner and publish it from your digital dark chamber.</seg>
<seg id="378">If the subject of color is coming, then everybody wants to express what buttons must express you. unfortunately, colour administration needs to provide you with adequate information about color management. additionally, you should make links with deeper information enable your own informal decisions to make your own informal decisions to make the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image workflows are fulfilled every six below, then you must not take care of color management.</seg>
<seg id="380">They work on a monitor of calibrated onto the sRGB colour space. (please find further information below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other image expenditures are via e-mail or web, where RGB of de-facto standard is.</seg>
<seg id="382">So, if sRGB so well works and life for all so easy, why should you use another colour space and make it easier to make colours about color spoiled?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of the limiting of sRGB in comparison to the colors we can really see below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors we can see the hufu region, and the colors in the RGB colour space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some larger farms, please visit Bruce Lindbloom page and then click Info and then click Information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to control my Monitor if I decided to work only in the RGB colour space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! if you do not work in the RGB colour space or not, you need to use your monitor. if you have to use your monitor. if you use as a color space of sRGB, then you need to use either your monitor on the sRGB standard kalligraphic, a matching monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections to improve the image in most cases. use it therefore before you try to try a further manual processing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The features normalize, the same, automatic and contrast extend from the menu corrected Automatic correction will automatically try out of your colors. you will have to experiment with these effects to see what is best in your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scaled the whole image that the darkest point black and the brightest point is so bright as possible without its color lock. this function is often a Magical correction for pictures the dark or balanced.</seg>
<seg id="391">The same method adjusts the luminosity of the colors of the selected picture, so that the histogram of the intensity can be achieved as flat as possible. thereby, there is very good results for improving the contrast of a picture, sometimes it produces only rubbish. it is a very powerful operation that causes either marvel at a picture or it destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic mode: this method maximizes the colour range in the red, green and blue channel. it determines the dark and light border tones and adjusts the red, green and blue channels on the entire histogrammar area.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast extend: this method improves the contrast and luminosity of the RGB values of a picture through the highest possible area and maximum values of all values between. this is only visible with balanced images and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white webins of & digiplug; is a semi-automated tool to perform the tinent of a photos.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white-off correction is a bit limited because of a colour space with 8-bit per color. if you are going to occur in the original image, which works in the raw mode, which works in 16 bit mode, so your possibilities will get better to correction better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white-equalizing algorithm of the copyright of Pawel T. Jochrome. they start with the menu entry colors white abnormalization of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The window window can be adjusted in size. on the left hand, both the original image is adapted to the preview of the tool. if you want to see the settings of the tool. if you want to see the original protein, then you can click on the bottom window.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target photos has a red marker. the Luminance of the Pixels under this marker is shown as vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">Right above is a histogram, so soon as you change a parameters. this histogram is very helpful, most pixels very small Luminance values. with one button you can choose whether one of the three colors or your sum will be displayed. the sum will be called Luminaire.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shadows, saturation and Gamma. the shadows allows you to improve the shading of your photos or even down dimming.</seg>
<seg id="401">Anstat with the above inspections, you should use the colour temperature pipette. press on this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the color temperature of the white-balance. this type will also be set automatically the temperature and green values.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white balance with the list of preferences. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The surplus dictator increases the colors when more than a color channel of the Pixels is exposed. you will get the combined result in a white indicator. this is displayed as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">Buttons Save as and load exactly this. each setting of the white-level you can set you in a text file and reload later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The knobs defaults all the filter values back to their standard values and the corresponding neutral white-equs. please note that neutral settings will be displayed as your original. if you store this screen, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can adjust the coefficients per color channel per color channel of the processed image. 8-bit coding is better suited for high quality images. this coding requires more panel space, calculating time and is only available for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool gives the same dialogue as to the processing of raw images. it uses the change and assignment of colour profiles. color mapping can be carried out by means of colour profiles. a detailed manual for the use of colour profiles can be sent to the text colour management.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is available in the menu under different color correction. this tool provides a integrated way to set up several color channels simultaneously, so you can always make it the same mistakes, and you will always need the same correction. in the manual to the audio error correction can be found.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful possibility of exposure to correct is the tool for gradation that you can find under colors Gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The & digiplug; tool color effects introduces four colour effects, a solar panel effect, a Velvia filter, a neon-effect and an edge filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing, Solarisation, also called Sabatier, was a effect of the additional light. this result was the effect that brighter areas darker and the colors were inverted by the second lighting. the result was a part negatively of the picture. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar isation. at approx. 50% intensity shows the picture which is chemically possible. finally a further increase is finally a negative image that is not able to create photopapier.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar energy efficiency. the original image is the (1) and the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it distinguishes itself from a saturation that he makes a stronger contrasting effect that makes the colours brilliant and smooth. try it easy to embellished many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for a unique colour film, manufactured by the Japanese company Fujifilm; and thereby a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvias is very saturated colours and also some photographers, especially those of the barely visible landscapes, too much.</seg>
<seg id="416">The Neonate simulates neonlight on the contrasting channels. the parameter level controls the brightness of the neonset. in large images, the filter can overload the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual to view the color contrasting and the luminosity of photos in the menu under colors. once your alignment can be found in preview. once you are satisfied with the result, use the button Ok and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you make a photo in bad lighting conditions, you can easily reduce the saturation. even in this case, the tool set for brightness / saturation is a good choice around saturation. all changes you can perform in preview. if they do the result, you can confirm the changes to Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool gradation and the simple leukph / contrast / Gamma is the tool to improve exposure. even if the dialog box is very complicated. even if the dialog box is very complicated, you require the area of the slider. in concrete the three slider below the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of intensity values, an histogram, the active canals or the selected area. under the graph, three slider can change in the image and the left side represents the dark and right side of the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn the control is to shift the knob and changes it, as the picture changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right hand, the original and preview of the image can be viewed dynamically, from the settings of the image, updated. on the left hand, the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selection box can be adjusted if the histogram is dominated by linear or logarithmapped Y axis. in images the large areas of a constant color is often dominated by a single column. in this case, the logarithmetic classification is useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three knob: the top for the dark tones, the medium for the bright tones and the lowest tones used for the medium tones, frequently gammac values.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three colour tweezers can be used in preview of the original image in order to adjust the inputs of the shadow, medium and bright tones automatically. in addition there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output: the output values allow manual values for each area. there are also two knob to change the output. for example, the compression of the output file can be used e.g. for the input. to create something different in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatic: with this button the image values are automatically set in dependence on the image values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and load: with these buttons, the set values are stored in the file system and later loaded, the Gimp levels is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three colour notes, the inputs will automatically be adjusted automatically for all shadows, means and sun exposure, and click on the preview of the original image to set the inputs for red, green, blueprint and Luminous channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The option Transbelment dictator controls all the color channels to view over overexposed pixel and you can view the combined result of all channels. this is a indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it's no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below is an example of the alignment of the intervention applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photos. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output effects are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the correct image with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left hand, half of the original and the target image will be displayed dynamically in dependence on your settings. on the right hand, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modification: this selection box allows to set the channel to be changed from the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">In addition to this box there are two symbols in a linear and logarithmapped view. for pictures taken with a constant color, the linear mode of a constant color creates a wide bars. in this case, the logarithmic mode helps in this case.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move a short venting to the right, e.g. the bright sounds, then you can see that these bright sounds are correspondent and corresponding to the corresponding image pixels of the darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">On the preview of the original photos is a red mark. if you want to change this mark on the curve you want to change the original value. create a point on this line and move it on and off until the value after your taste is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and load: with these buttons you can do exactly this. every curve can be saved in the file system and later loaded, the file format is the Gimp curve format.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you want to create this method and the three colour-grain buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of the shattentive, medium and sunny, click the original image to set the control points for the red, green, blueprint and Luminous curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The option of the overboard dictator controls all the color channels. if more than one channel overloaded pixels, you get the combined result. this is a indicator that you get the effect only in preview and it's no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below, you can see a black-and-white photo that was corrected in the Luminous channel. shad- and sun tones used to be applied to the curves. the original image is (1) and the correct (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The Channel Mixer of the digiplug; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the color shades of the photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the shades of the images. you can process it from the menu colors Channel Mixer of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel selection box, you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first note as you can correct the positive distribution and rash. the left section of the window shows you a preview. the original can be viewed as compared to the own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target picture has a red marker. if you set this in the image, a vertical line in the histogram to display the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">The controls for the module are on the right below: regulator for red, green and construction, if you need to keep these channels. if you also use Luminance, because the channel Mixer is able to preserve it the production of great black-and-white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black-and-white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially if you mix monochrome, leads the reduction of a colour to a visible noise that occur from farbrauschen. when the case, you can improve your monochrome conversion through which you can first reduce the colourless.</seg>
<seg id="447">The Save as and loading buttons are used precisely for this purpose. any mixer setting allows you to save and then load. the used file format is the Gimp channel audio format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The option Transbelment dictator controls all the color channels to view over overexposed pixel and you can view the combined result of all channels. this is a indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it's no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a photo in which the blue channel was re-adjusted. the option Luminance is enabled. the original image is activated below (1) and the working image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography was always intriguing because of your abstraction. with the development of digital photography is black / white a work step because paint pictures can easily be converted on the computer. also with a set of film roller profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white filmmaker with a green lens filter. this looks good, with all scenarios and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky. so similar to the 004 Cokin (TM) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Oranfiltered: simulates a black / white filmmaker with an orange lens filter. this improves landscapes, marine scenes and aerial photos. so similar to the 002 Cokin (TM) Orantes.</seg>
<seg id="454">Red filters: simulates a black / white filmmaker with a red lens filter. this creates dramatic sky effects and can simulate lunar to the daily time. so similar to the 003 Cokin (TM) rotates.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellowfilter: simulates a black / white filmmaker with an yellow lens filter. this is the natural color correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 Cokin (TM) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepulon: generates warm bright and medium tones throughout the shear. this is very similar to the process of a pressure and redevelopment in a sepacioner. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 005 Cokin (TM) Sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">Using the digiplug; tool texture, you can apply decorative textures to a picture.</seg>
<seg id="458">With adding a texture to your picture, irrespective whether it is a color picture or not, you can look like a wall painting on a wall. the menu entry shows picture texture and image processing can be used for it.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: postpone of this parameter to the right the depth of the depth and three-dimensional texture rate increases to the picture.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper text effect is applied on the photo below. the original image is set (1) and modified (2). the relief is set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With the digiplug; tool frame can be added to a decorative frame to be added a picture.</seg>
<seg id="462">The eye of an considerations in the limits of a photos is no easy task. a possibility to keep its attention. this is a psychological barrier for scattering eye. using image, the module can be launched from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter you set the desired frame type for your image. through a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black and white images), it is tailored to a nice three-dimensional frame and decoratively adds a decorative frame with pattern.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: returns the width of the frame in percent. the value range for the width is limited from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">That is bigger than the original target picture is bigger than the original but the same aspect ratio. this is important for printing the images, especially if you use the tool Folding the aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this practical tool, you can insert simple, formatted text in a picture at any place. this also goes to several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply type the text and place it with the mouse. if you need the text size, the larger must be the character set. at the end, simply select the character set. at the end, simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi-transparent background.</seg>
<seg id="468">Each setting which you have chosen for your text can be changed until you have been stored on the button "OK. after the image has been saved, the text part of the image. it cannot be changed.</seg>
<seg id="469">Using the digiplug; tool template uses you can put a template over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The menu image template use in image processing can be used to put templates over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For templates, there are no restrictions concerning the size and orientation. you need to add the PNG file format, and you should simply add your template's file size; if you want to add shstencil bank to the & digiplug; mailinglist digicame-users @ kde.org..</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for first time you have to put your stencil folder with the knob folder in dialogue. select the folder where you will be copied to the folder. this settings will be noted for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder for template has been set, a building structure of the stencil folder appears again. the selection of a folder will be updated automatically.</seg>
<seg id="474">Under the preview there are three buttons with which you can change the magnification factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this knob increases the darkened image. it is centered around the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Smaller: this knobs resized this button. if you want to use the template's position. if you want to use the template onto the whole image, you need to scroll the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Slide: use this button to move the template below the template. take the image and place it on the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK if you want to apply the template onto your picture. the image will then be adjusted automatically.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digiplug; provides three different tools to sharpening. each of you have pre-tracts in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it's very fast and easy, but especially in dark areas, grained pictures.</seg>
<seg id="481">Unrivalled mask works on the contrast of the edges to look like a picture of sharpenal. you can use it to remove atmospheric Dunst and makes it a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is copyright protected by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">It is possibly the best of the three, since it really improved the sharpness. it is a bit complicated in its application and has different parameters to adapt.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus and most digitalised images need a correction of the sharpness. this means that the digitization process paints can be printed along with just minimum differences when displaying the digitization process. SLR cameras usually require more retrospeculation than normal cameras for the home users.</seg>
<seg id="484">JPEG pictures, JPEG pictures often have been used to use internal sharpening. pictures in the shell size must always be shaken during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanner have a sharpening filter already during the reading of the picture. if you deactivate it, you get control of your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get usable results by taking a photo with the sharpening throwing sharpening. you can corrected using the menu entry.</seg>
<seg id="487">You should also be careful because the results are not very natural: the sharpness is increasing the sharpness of the edges, but amplifies the noise. in general, you will find further information on the menu entry. you can find further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crispy. the solution to correct it is much easier than it. use the tool for the switch with the menu entry. use the window on the right side of the dialog box shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter unsharp is a very good tool to remove muzzle from your photos. you can see here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview can help edit the image. the showcase shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often generate good results and should be able to test the effect. if you create the sharpening mask to be strong, smokers and impression of grats in the vicinity of sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius represents a lot of pixels on each side of a edge by the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radii. you should therefore sharpened pictures in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the wisted picture one of the original. therefore, the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The swelling value is a fraction from the maximum RGB-value and to the difference difference. this way, areas can be used for a edge of the filter. in this way, areas with a soft change between killing of sharpenalties and therefore beautifull errors are avoided in faces, Himmler and water surface.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of unsharp mask filters. the original picture is the (1) and the worked picture (2). unsharp mask was applied with a radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digiplug; tool refocusses focus an image by improving the sharpness. it used the copyright protected unfolding filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries to get a picture to & quot; on which it's a better approach to sharpening. it uses a technology called FIR Vienna Filing. it uses a better result than unsharp mask. you can use it from the menu by using colors Refocus on image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circular saw is much better than the Gauge's Few. however, the mathematical result is derived from the original pixel pixels, which is far influenced by the original pixel pixels, which can even influenced in most cases even very strongly of the remote pixels. the causes undesirable results.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of circular fetch. it is the most important parameters for the use of this module. for most images, the default value should be 1 good results if your image should be very unsharp, but then on the sanctuary.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: the correlation can help reduce artefacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. the correlation is close to 1, & eg; 0,95 and 0,99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpest effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Rauschfilter: an increase in the filter filter can help you to reduce artefacts. however, values higher than 0.1 can be very rare. if the noise filter is too low, & eg; 0 is the image quality so bad. a usable value is 0,03. a high value is still further contamination.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauge's sharpness: this is the radius of the Gauge's sharpness. in most cases, you should use this value to 0 to avoid annoying artefacts. if you use a value of zero, you might also need to increase the correlation and / oderive filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrizensize: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. if you choose large values for the circular wire or the Gauss's sharpness. note the module is very slow when you select large values for this parameter. in most cases, you should select a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The Save as and loading buttons are used exactly to this purpose. any reproduction parameters will be set for later and then can be loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to use all cutting, colour and intensity structures on the picture before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module before you change the image. the reason for this is that much operations are not immediately visible, but then left unpleasant artifacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you read pictures and compressed, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, blurred masks produces better results than sharpening. this could be caused by unsharp masks using a bigger neighborhood as sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically it must always generate artefacts. even under optimal conditions it can never indicate that the optimum linear filter is always at least as good as the unspores mask. the FIR Vienna filter is often better in processing of small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below, you can see a comparison between different filters, on a small undisputed image:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp color image must be corrected. this image has been taken with a analog camera. the unfocused result is attributable to unsufficient light for the auto focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information about the methods for sharpening structure in digital images, you can read a technical comparison in English under this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The knob line sets the unsharpest part of the darkeness, to create a natural Pupille.</seg>
<seg id="514">The color tinte enables the adapted color for the pupil. if you want blue eyes rather than dark, you can set this here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool-error correction is one of the most developed tool to remove undesired artifacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Involalgorithm was developed by the IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS Labors in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool includes various settings as a starting point to simplify the restoration. the available settings are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings, you can use the rider Glance and Advanced Settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Fine posture p [0, 100]: this controls the conservation of details. a value of 0.9 should get details mainly homogeneous regions and details. a value of 0.9 should be found so that no sharpening is necessary. please note that it should always be subject to the directing dependency.</seg>
<seg id="520">Direction dependency level alpha [0,100]: a small value is smoother into all directions while a value is close to 1 in one direction. JPEG artefacts will produce a high value of similar patterns. JPEG artefacts will be best eliminated at a value near 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smoothing [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above alles. p defines the relative smoothing. set this value therefore suitable to the degree of smokers in your picture.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is necessary, as it is difficult when it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh's Turbulence effect it must be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: returns as often the algorithm. usually ranges 1 or 2.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angle gradual as [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of the anisotropic Alpha. if Alpha is small, it should also create small angles. you should select this value so much and to acceptable for your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integrating stride length [0,1, 10]: integrating stride width in pixels. you should set the value smaller than 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never greater than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear Interpolation use: the More to quality that you receive by selecting this option is just small. he doubles the running time. we therefore recommend it to allow him to allow him.</seg>
<seg id="527">Buttons Save as and load exactly that. each setting of image errors can be corrected in a text file and will be loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="528">Image error correction is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can still last very long and take a high CPU load. you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the knob.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below, you can see how to be removed with minor artefacts. the module will be applied on a photograph that in Guatemala City was created with an analog camera. as you see, there is a bad black artifact that is caused by a bad film storage during the trip (1) and the correct image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digiplug; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce educational noise. it uses a copyright protected algorithm from Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filter to remove stains and other artefacts which can be removed from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or moorussian; effects of fed images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information about sensors of digital cameras, you can read this tutorial in English at this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grained noise which can be removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the subwindow details and the windows of Advanced Settings can remain in the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter. large values increase the time values per pixel and can display the image below the image and the color in him is smoothed and thus smaller bug fixes.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sharpness distance. this value sets the pixel distance to the front in order to adjust the edges. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter does not receive any more and smokers or dirt again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge accuracy for the edge. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong, you can't get the whole noise in the maximum, if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG artefacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance of the image. we recommend either color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoother process of the details.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the tolerance tolerance of the image. we recommend either color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoother process of the details.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gammatolerance of the picture. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas, which are typically stronger than to increase. it also dirty the shadmites.</seg>
<seg id="541">Cushioning: controls the alignment of phasenjitterdamping. this value defined as fast the adaptive filter radius on variations of the luminance. when he is on his minimum, noise and phasenjitter may occur on the edges. it can remove noise levels and is the recommended method for this.</seg>
<seg id="542">Save and store: these buttons are used precisely for this. all parameters for the noise reduction that you have set, can be stored into the file system and later loaded.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the fixed production was applied to the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crispy for your purpose. the solution, which is a bit soft to shark. do this tool to switch with the menu entry, and experiment with the glass window. on the right side of the dialog box shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digiplug; photo Restauration is definitely one of reducing the most widely developed tools to reduce photography artifacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter to the restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artifacts, film grains, scratches, scratches, crushing, compression artefacts and local mistakes occurs in digital, original or later digitised images. the smoothing takes place along the image contours and receives the content as well as the human eye.</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for colour and texturing. the texism is developed using another tool, the error correction was developed by the IMAGE Team of GREC CNRS Labors in Caen / Frann. and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG artefacts reduce the compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas it produces some compression & quot; artefacts & quot; - small standards that can be displayed in uncompressed image. this setting should be correct.</seg>
<seg id="549">Buttons Save as and store make exactly this. every setting of photo restorations can be saved in a text file and will be loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo-Restauration is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can still last very long and take a high CPU load. you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the knob.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below, you can reduce as a photo with equilateral noise. the module is applied to an Ilford (TM) HP-5 movie with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the notorious film grading of the faces. the original image is under (1) and the correct below (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below, you can see another example of the photo restoration. this time, textures can be found on an old colour photo taken by using a scanner. you can see the scan artifacts and the photo paper. the original image is shown below (1) and the correct image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The & digiplug; tool Hotpixel allows you to remove hotpixel of photos that have been removed with a CCD camera. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project that are protected by Martin Dickp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, tote or hot pixels are particularly high-quality raw material photos, because many cameras with JPEG compression have a built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot pixels; and "quot; bright pixel quot; for a photo with a dark image subtracting method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file in the wizard with the button dark image. the tool will automatically determine the hot and bright pixels. these are highlighted in the image preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera, it's important to take the dark image directly in the connection to discover new hot or bright pixel by CCD Defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should download the appropriate dark image to correct image. a automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixel image. note that the assistant remembers the last dark image and reload this automatically in the next meeting.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and preview help you to correct within the image. the showcase shows the output of the filter with the current settings. bad pixels are highlighted in all advantages.</seg>
<seg id="560">Choose an area to preview the defective pixel by preview and the results of the Filters. choose the best filter method to interpolate this pixel blocks. these are the available filter:</seg>
<seg id="561">Duration: there is an average of the neighbouring pixel. the resulting colour is assigned to all defective pixels. for a 1-dimensional interpolation, this is separately available for horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a spacing of 1 pixel (2-Dim) or a group of linear curves (1-Dim) or a group of linear curves (1-Dim). these are then used to interpolisher in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the default method. all pixels with a spacing of 2 or less to the pixel block to calculate a bi-square surface (2-Dim) or a group of square curves (1-Dim), which is then used to interpolate the pixel.</seg>
<seg id="564">Kubisch: all pixels with a spacing of 3 or less is moved to interpolate a bi-cubic surface (2-Dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-Dim), which is then used to interpolisher pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the Hotpixel correction on a color photograph, from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposures to see the original image has been increased to 300% (1) and the correct image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The digiplug; vignetization correction is a tool to correct the vignetization, i.e. unexposed corners, an image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide angle lens, especially the entire sensor range cannot illuminate the entire sensor range. instead & quot; vignetting at which they reach the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light to the sensor there.</seg>
<seg id="568">But he has also disadvantages. many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 at aperture filters, which is impossible to hold the camera with hand. wide angle lens, also using center filter, an aperture of f / 16 or less, because otherwise unrivalled effects through movement arise.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the big exposure areas of today's film and color scanner, it is possible to simulate the effect of a Centerfilter, which without these filter is used, the transformation with a Centerfilter is turned on an image. the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three shelves you can control the vignetization correction filter and three other exposure of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of luminous efficiency at the point of the largest density filter. the standard density amounts to 2.0, resulting in an optical filter with a aperture adjustment of 1, or by chance to compensate a greater degree of vignetization, reduce it to compensate a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Leuchstrength, Contrinal and Gamma-Settings: the editing of an image with the vignetting correction is reduced. you need to re-adjust the exposure of the target image with these options, as you have to increase the settings only.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a more sensitive new adjustment of the target image, let the values for luminosity / contrast / Gamma at zero and use the gradation from the & digiplug; image editing from the menu Color Gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of vignetization correction to a picture. the original image (1) shows the vignetization in the corners and (2) the correct image and contrast correction was also done in the picture with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digiplug; lens separation is a tool to correct the impact of spherical lenses to photos. it uses a copyright protected algorithm from David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortion. colourless distortion cannot be corrected using this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second grazing deals the general geometrical distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third degree has a similar round effect, but shallow to edges. this correction is not applied in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient of the coefficient is corrected the remote corners to the second degree. if you combine these two, any geometrical distortion can be virtually eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">Generally: this value controls the thickness of the distortion of the second degree. with negative values, tonnage-shaped distortion can be corrected and positive values.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the thickness of the distortion of the distortion. this value is stronger than in the center of the image. for most lenses, the 'vertices parameter has the inverted mark of the parameter.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value scaled the image size and performs a correction of first grading through. negative values increase while positive the image.</seg>
<seg id="583">Brighter: this value adjustment the brightness in the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners, while positive values increase them.</seg>
<seg id="584">In order to help you find the best filter settings, the dialog with a preview the distortion error correction. values can be used for your image, are stored and used at the next start as standard values.</seg>
<seg id="585">The tonnage or ciential correction should be carried out before all cutting or size changes. at the best end, you execute a picture to cut and then perform a tonnage correction would be the effect of the False.</seg>
<seg id="586">In order to help you the best correction of the screen shows you a vertical and horizontal relief line. move the mouse button in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines on this site. in connection, you can correct the tonnage / cannular distortion with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you corrected a ciential distortion will correct the resulting image of black corners. you can remove them with the cutting tool in the menu and remove them from the image processing or via the Zoom regulator of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">For most images, the K-shaped correction is sufficient. the next logical step for some motifs such as photos from the front, frames and paintings it is possible to correct all angles in the picture 90 degrees. note that if you have the camera with the hand, you always have a slight distortion of perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the tonnage correction applied to a church in Norway. the original image is below (1) and the correct image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method to simulate infrared film of the vaccine and org web site. filter reproduces the well-known Ilford (TM) SFX200 Iinfrared film, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left hand side of the window, you can select the area for preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse, you can consider the effect on different parts of the image.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview you can set two parameters for film grafts and film sensitivity (ISO). if you want to simulate the gradient texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO knob changes the amount of film green (chlorophyll in nature) in conversion. green meadows are white as snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filter channels to reproduce infrared film, especially the green channel makes it not make sense to use the effect on black / white photos because the color information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared filmic feature applied to a landscape photo of New Zealand. the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values produce a kind of Aura in the top.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digiplug; filter trays is an easy-to-use tool to reproduce film gradient to your images. this is known by classic high-speed films such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X. to increase the sensitivity of the films, the manufacturer of large silver grafts of photemulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film grain effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past. if you want to get a timeless atmosphere get rid of everyday life. if you want to use this special, gallery-like, road photo, grained view especially in your monochromen photos, so you need to use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">With the knob the ISO sensitivity can be calibrated to control the intensity and granularity of the gradient. if you need more values, ISO-2400 is set. if you need more body, you can use the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the soundproofed effect on a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and the modified film sensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digiplug; filter oil paintings creates the appearance of a oil painting. it uses a protected legal algorithm from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digiplug; filter oil paintings gives your digital pictures a nice appearance like a oil painting. natural images and styles are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two knob to influence this effect. the upper selects the pin size between one and five. thickly brush are better suitable for large images. smoothing, the smoothing or, from the other hand, the hinges.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with the (1) and the user is marked with (2). brush size for this 640 pixel image is 1 and smooth 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digiplug; filter charcoal drawing uses paint and intensity gradient to create a carboneskizable. pictures whose gradients vary slowly, if you would like to imagine what scene you would have chosen you to skizzate. this would be good pictures to start.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two knob with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper knob chooses the pin size and the lower deviation the contrast (glass).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the carbon filter filter. the original image (1) and the modified picture (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digiplug; filter engraving the image in 3-D, as if it is stamped in wax. it uses a copyright protected algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & digiplug; filter engraving is a fast tool to restore your images with a 3-D effect. it works especially well with images with a simple structure. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image in a gray, mondaring landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows you to adjust the contrast of the filtration. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the worked picture (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">Using this filter group you can transform a normal photo in an artwork by distortion effect. it uses legally protected algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave blocks 1: divides the image in cells and can look it as if it is viewed through glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave blocks 2: analog to the wave blocks 1, the image is distorted here with a different version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require long time to calculate and create a high CPU load. you can stop this effect at any time with the knob.</seg>
<seg id="614">Using this filter group you can transform a normal photo in an artwork by unsharfe effects. it uses legally protected algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom Notice: distorted the image along the sterformal lines which go out from a center. this simulates a zooming camera and thereby generates a dynamic expression of often in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial infinity: wiped the image by rotation of the pixel by a focal point. this simulates the visual acuity of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distance acuity: wipate the image to generate the effect of a non-focused camera position. the object seems to come back in the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Motion of motion: wipate the image by horizontal movements of pixels. this simulates the sharpness of a linear moving, z: B: from a car or train photographing, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Turnout Unrife: wiped the picture softened in the dark and heavily in the bright tones. this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or to add a warm and subtilting light.</seg>
<seg id="620">Shook-sharper: wipate the image by accidental shift of pixels and simulates the sharpness of an arbitrarily moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent Insharfe: finds the Farms in the picture and wiped them without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: shares the photo in rectangular cells and then creates it to the colt with an average pixel value.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require long time to calculate and cause high CPU load. you can therefore break this calculation at any time with the knob.</seg>
<seg id="624">The shelves are a nice little tool to make radrops onto your image. this gives it natural your images a nasses look. it uses a Pieter Voloshyn urheberized algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Dripping size allows to change the size of the trophies. since the dripping size is not automatically reducing the size for small images. amount changes the number and density of drops. fish changes the optical effect of the drops on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can hold with the & digiplug; image editing a range freely from Regentropes. use the range, e.g. a face to stay free. if you start off the filter Regentropes, the area will remain free of raentropes.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the filter. the original image (1) shows a quiet sunset and the beworked picture (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photograph has the wrong orientation, you can attach it through mirror or turning to the right orientation. you can find the tools in the menu transformations and transformers.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo bubbles is definitely one of the most sophisticated tools developed by a photo to enlarge a minimum loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">A picture to be smaller is simple. the big question is how you can see a picture? how can you see a picture? how can you see the lack of dissolution? how can you see the lack of dissolution? how can you see the lack of dissolution? how can you see the lack of dissolution? how can you see the missing information? how can you see the missing information? try it here and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo is the wrong size you can change it on the desired size with the tool size. select the size in the menu and enter the target values. the dialog box is shown below.</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool for size change uses a linear interpolation method to increase the pixels. if you want to increase a small picture with a better quality, then try the tool to blow-up.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many educational programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. spine interpolation to enlarge an image. & digiplug; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm was developed by the IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS Labors in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You need to change the tool as you want to change the size. these settings are available in the rider New Size and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">The aspect ratio maintained: if this setting is activated, the new size is the aspect ratio of the original size of the original size.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is necessary, as it is difficult when it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh's Turbulence effect it must be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">Buttons Save as and load will be used exactly. each entry for photo increase can be stored as a text file and will be loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo bubbles is very fast when making it, but it can still last very long and take a high CPU load. you can break the calculation at any time with the knob.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example of photo bubbles, by adding a small color image to double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (2) is the result of the linear standard magnification.</seg>
<seg id="640">The cutting of a photos is not just a common operation, but also a commonly underestimated tool, you can simply use the rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and drag the rectangle, then you will see this rectangle while you move your mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">If you want to release the mouse button, the area of the photos will be cut off. thereby, you can cut a good overview like your picture. you can move the size of the rectangle, creating a new rectangle with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cut-cut button in the image processing in the toolbar and the photo is tailored (Ctrl; + X). use the file to store or file sharing in the menu file to store the newly designed photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the field of view, you can change the size of the rectangle by pressing the edges with the mouse. the aspect ratio that you have defined in dialogue remains.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the tool Following side ratio, you can specify the orientation as high-format or cross-format. in high-format, the greater value of the height and in the lateral format is assigned.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool is used for aspect ratio. this means that it is always equal, regardless of whether you are centimeters, Inch or any other physical size. you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photopapier and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog there exist two knobs around the selection automatically horizontal or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">Below in a dialogue with the Max. ratio knob to the size to the maximum possible, depending on the chosen ratio and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool According to the aspect ratio saves the settings depending on the image orientation (Horizontal or Veral). if you are stored on the image, these settings are stored in the EXIF tables, so the EXIF data is reflected the tailored image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of the compositions assistance enables to help themselves to assemble your paintings better. these assists are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonious triangle: harmonic particles are based on the principle of similarity. like the third party, harmonic triangles are designed to share a rectangle in similar harmonic triangles.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden middle: the golden centre is a partition that is based on different natural growth model, such as the spiral of a Nautilus sea or the bubble leaves of a sunflower. it dives in all possible things that we can find as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden division is the Irrational number 1,618033988... and it was used to design your temples and pyramids in all times when you have your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number runs from Fibonacci Episode 1, 1, 2, 5, 8, 13, 21, 21, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34 & etc. a composition that is considered as a visually harmonious.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden centre provides liquefied relief lines if you have a painting. the help below are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden spiral becomes a good results for your photos. in comparison to the third party, the golden spiral leads to the eye through the image. this kind of composition leads the gaze along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetric visual river.</seg>
<seg id="656">Another rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles to create the golden spiral. this can be one line or different objects. this little can be just because his eye can be moved without the eye, it will fulfill its task.</seg>
<seg id="657">The Golden triangles is also discussed by the top of the golden braces. its vertex points are the middle points of the golden rectangles. please note that in contrast to harmonic triangles, golden triangles. diagonal of these lines can place a static object.</seg>
<seg id="658">If you use golden triangles around your frame you create a effect of professional photographs dynamic Symmetry. try your image focus on one of the intersections and other visual information in the triangles. the result is very attractive composition that can't reach them differently.</seg>
<seg id="659">The options are reflected and the vertical mirror can be used to reflect the harmonic particles.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button color, you can set the color of the relief lines. if you have a picture of many colors and a high contrast, the relief lines can be invisible. on this type, you can adjust the color of the lines to your current picture.</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free Rotation is a tool to rotate a picture to each angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you make a photo, it happens slightly that you are not exactly vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture where things are turned around an angle. you can repair all the camera; image processing and the tool-free rotation. choose Free rotation and adjust the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Turn your image with the slider angle. the values on this slider are specified in degrees. setting the slider to 0 degrees. a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the image will be shown on the right.</seg>
<seg id="664">To help your help, the module features a horizontal and a vertical line. move the mouse button in the image preview to fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now, adjust the angle as described in the previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">Once you have shot an image, you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. one way to repair it is the function transformation from image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the image. select the function automatically. choose one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The option anti-aliasing smoothes the picture a bit after turning. note the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All performers transformations are carried out around the reference point of the so-called reference point. this point is shown in the center of the image and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">In order to change the perspective, you need to use the red squares on the corners of your image. the preview will then be calculated automatically. on the right side of the dialog, you will find some information which help you to change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: shows the width of the new image, including the empty areas which are produced through the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: shows the height of the new image, including the empty areas which are produced through the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle left: displays the current angle in degrees at the upper left corner of the transformed surface.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle to the right: displays the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the transformed surface.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle left: shows the current angle in degrees at the bottom left corner of the transformed surface.</seg>
<seg id="675">Bottom right: shows the current angle in degrees at the bottom right corner of the transformed surface.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adapting the perspective, the picture is slightly dirty. this effect is small, but two adaptations produce a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you have to view the perspective, you get unpleasant triangular holes at the corners. a possibility to use it is the image with transformations from image editing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The shot tool is used to shift a part of the image in one direction. this is no rotation, the image is distorted. with other words, a rectangle is turned into a parallelogram. you can launch this module about transformers.</seg>
<seg id="679">Scissors your image by clicking the horizontal angle and vertical angle. if you press the angle to zero, the angle will be set to zero. a preview of the effectual is displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be shown on the right.</seg>
<seg id="680">To help you get a vertical and horizontal line. move the mouse to a key point, like the lake, a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the lock tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After which you have carried out the image, the image will usually be scanned. for a single etching, this effect is usually negligible, but twice as much as per person, and therefore, you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After slacking the image has a beautiful triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate it is the image with transformations from image editing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digicame; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats, therefore from your system and, in some cases, such as these libraries were computed. in most distributions you can process a large number of image formats with & digiplug;</seg>
<seg id="684">Due to this dependence of other libraries, it is impossible to give a list of all available file formats, but you will always find JPEG and TIFF among them.</seg>

<seg id="686">Almost all digital cameras save photos in one of two formats: JPEG or TIFF. some cameras allow you to select the format. a detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia. & digiplug; supported both formats.</seg>
<seg id="687">Image compression is the application of data compression techniques in digital images. redundant information is reduced to save data on a more efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="688">JPEG 2000 is also supported. in general there is better, smooth results than JPEG during the same compression ratio. the 2000s can also be saved, if this is specified in the settings.</seg>
<seg id="689">If you want to learn more about the raw image format, you can read more information about Wikipedia, The Luminous Copper and Cambridge. you can read all formats images in JPEG or TIFF with the raw image conversion of & digiplug; in the section configuration you can find more information about the use of modules with & digiplug;</seg>

<seg id="810">The KIPI module for geographic localization sets tools to localise pictures geographic in the spherical coordinate system, which is used by GPS and Galileo is used to localize. height, longitudinal and latitude are used.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlated your pictures with geographical data, you need a GPS track as XML file in GPX format. gpsbabel and gpsman can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Picture Geographical localization Correlator. this interface can lead a number of selected images with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the pictures you want to correlated the menu in the main window and call the menu. in order to load a possible correlation between time and localization, you need to load a track file with GPX file. this file contains the same time to same places such as the pictures of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">When the file loaded, you will display the coordinates in red. GPS track data are recorded in GMT-time and thus the camera stops at GMT. this can be carried out with the time zone. put here your camera time zone.</seg>
<seg id="815">The adjustment for the maximum time deviation is a upper deviation for the GPS time and camera time. the deviation among them will be merged. the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you don't have a track data from a place, you can process the GPX file manually and add to the images. the time difference of 2000 seconds will then correlated all pictures in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options interpolating and difference in minutes can be used if you have no matching data. if you know that in reality a location in a large time difference between camera and GPS, you can put this boundaries here and then correlated the button.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be set manually with this dialog. this is useful if you have a set of photos on the same place. since the dialog you need to use the button OK button to set the data on the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found with the displayed map and enlarge it. choose the relevant region, and enlarge it again. the height must always be selected manually. the card can always be changed manually. the card can be changed between card mode, satellite photo and a mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Completely outside the KIPI module there are possibilities to hang the GPS data to the images. here is a small script that the exiftool is used to provide a stack of images with GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The KIPI module picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums than HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums in a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.01. you can select the albums selected as HTML pages. the character set will be encoded as UTF-8, to enable a best internationalization.</seg>
<seg id="823">The module has four riders on which settings can be adjusted. the rider can only select any albums. with the three buttons on the right hand you can select a large number of albums. in the area of them the Albenchmarks and the text of the HTML page will appear on the right side of the HTML page.</seg>
<seg id="824">The rider appearance defines the general look and layout for each side. this tab is a page open. if you then click on a picture, a new page will be opened on the picture. otherwise, the image will be displayed directly with your standard image viewer, & eg;</seg>
<seg id="825">The rider album defines the settings where and how the gallery can be stored in all your corresponding pictures. choose a folder on which you can write a folder on the name KIPIHTMLExport, which contains everything, will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you have selected the JPEG file format, the EXIF data will be stored in your original images even in the new pictures.</seg>
<seg id="827">With other colour depth, you can change the default color depth, and the file size can also be explained. all other settings are explained.</seg>
<seg id="828">The rider's impression allows you to adjust some of the settings from the album tab for the pictures, that are small images shown in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window shows the user as far the promotion is. press down to break the process.</seg>
<seg id="830">If the module produces the sides, the window will not be closed automatically. you can therefore read the program messages to display whether error occurred during the generation. the web browser will be shown automatically at the end to show the preview of the gallery. press Close to connect the module.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI image viewer is a very fast and flexible OpenGL-based tool to view images.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI picture viewer allows you to view a selection of images and put on them basic operations such as rotations, zooming or shift. the viewer can be made with short notice and quick access to its functions.</seg>
<seg id="833">After launching a picture by default in full screen mode, this can be changed in a window mode.</seg>
<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG Lossless module is a tool to alter images without any quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows to store images listed below, images in JPEG format, excluding the usual losses of quality and metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of the loss-free storage is that the file size rises, as no compression of the color information is taking place. these can be found e.g. at PNG format.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI module digital camera client is a tool to connect your computer with a digital camera.</seg>
<seg id="838">The KIPI module digital camera client currently has no documentation. if you are interested in writing, please contact the mailinglist of the KIPI Teams under KDE-imaging @ kde.org. Note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="839">The KIPI module metadata editor currently has no documentation. if you want to change this situation, please contact the mailinglist KDE-imaging @ kde.org of the KIPI team.</seg>
<seg id="840">With the import function of metadata module, you can copy data from one image to another. choose the image selection dialog with which you want to copy the image selection dialog with which you want to copy the metadata. the data will be copied after clicking on the button OK.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function does not work with all image formats. you can copy from anywhere but not in any target format. JPEG is supported by writing. please check out exiv2 to see which formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG Kodierer module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of a dip.</seg>
<seg id="843">The MPEG Kodierer module can be used to convert selected pictures in a MPEG video, using a defined length. this module uses MjpegTools and ImageMagick. between the individual images, you can add a basic image editing. you can also add a audio file in MP2 or WAV of the dikerau.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images are automatically scaled to the correct size for the selected video format. in addition, you can create a background color for the diashau. in addition, you can use the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player. finally, you can eventually use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">First you need to select the images that are packed in MPEG Diashau, and then you can start the Module via extras MPEG Diashau.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images selected by you are listed below image files in the portfolio. you can also change the pictures or content of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are satisfied with your list, you should select the other settings. if you're selecting the video format, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. in case you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is default and most probably the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">The next step, you should specify the time in seconds. the speed of the image process is fixed below. a low value produces very sudden, high contrast, very smooth image changes.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set as next. in doubt you should leave the name and the path of the generated file, you can set it under the name of the MPEG output file.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you want to specify a audio file under the name of the audio source file, you can start the production of the movie. depending on the speed of your computer you can now drink a coffee or drink at all the rest of your computer, if you are back again.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a hint appears that Kodiers or tools are missing, you can adapt the paths to the programs of the MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages on the right below.</seg>
<seg id="852">The printer driver allows you to print multiple images on a paper sheet together in standard Photovariables. the combined images can also be opened automatically with the Image Processing Gimp. this is useful to enhance you or to print the Gimp module to direct expression.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module you can import images in one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM formats.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command line mcraw from Dave Coffin. an original version of Him is not expect from dcraw, we expect the same results as the software of your camera vendor. sometimes you get better results!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First, select the RAW file to convert and run the module. the Raw-image converter window appears then in mode for a single image. you can preview the effect of your current settings on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option is to be adjusted if the camera settings can be adjusted for white and red / blue amplifier. if the result is not optimal, you can further process the image later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected to use the contrasting information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switch has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are satisfied with the preview you can save one of the three output formats. the filename is equal and only the extension will be adjusted accordingly. JPEG uses a lossless algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">Tagged Image Format, TIFF, retains all the information of your image and uses the lossless LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">In case you should select your pictures often or later, you should not use the JPEG format, as it is just a limited number of operations permitted before the image quality has deteriorated. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you want to choose JPEG format, the metadata is stored in the RAW file, which is stored in the EXIF information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adapted your settings, you can start the conversion button. if you want to reopen this process, you can turn off this process.</seg>
<seg id="863">The stacking processing mode allows you to convert different images to once. use this mode if you are safe, e.g. by testing at a single picture, which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical with the version for individual images. however, this is helpful to overwrite the possibility to overwrite this. a preview is however not available. the progress balancing shows how far the conversion is advanced.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to compress all images in an album. it uses the program convert from ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all images of a album. you can set the prefix, the starting number and the timestamp of the timestamps.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of several images of a picture collection. it uses the transfer program from the ImageMagick package. you can make the image smaller or enlarge. these are four types of image change provided:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in dimension. width or height of the image will be automatically selected, depending on the image orientation, the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): size change in two dimensions. here, the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option for example to customize your image format.</seg>
<seg id="870">Not proportional: not proportioning size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed at this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Printing process: prepares the image for the photo pressure. the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the photo paper. the target picture, including background size, marginal size and background color, is adjusted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected pictures with your preferred E-mail program. there is also possible to remove the size of the images in advance. further pictures can draw on the list of sending images and place there.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you start the module, the pictures window will be shown with the selected images. you can add more images to a file selection dialog box with a file selection dialog. for the last selected image will be displayed on the right hand side.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also draw images on the picture list and add there to the list of sending images.</seg>
<seg id="875">The button pictures will remove the selected pictures from the list of sending images.</seg>
<seg id="876">After you have selected all the pictures you can open the New Message -window of your e-mail clients. you must only add the addresses and bedding. the selected pictures are already attached as appendix.</seg>
<seg id="877">Don't pay attention to a lot of pictures at once. most e-mail accounts are limitations for the size of sending e-mails. it is possibly a good idea to send many emails if you want to send many images.</seg>
<seg id="878">The E-Mail window is used to change settings for sending the images. your configuration will be stored and reused anytime until you change them.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your e-mail clients from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you'll need to specify the right path for your installation.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you use the Google Mail Service, you must install the GMailies on your computer. you can download this here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After the election of comments in an attached file, the comments are added to the images into a text file and is added to the email.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format below the menu pictures file format is not very suitable to use the size of photo files, but it is best adapted to the loss of photo files, but if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed. otherwise, we recommend the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you want to select JPEG format files and original files in JPEG format, then the original exifconfig file will be added to send pictures.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is finished, the window will not be closed automatically, so you can view the status messages, in search of errors, you can see. your e-mail program will automatically start at the end. with the knob you can lock this window shlie? EN.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the module advanced Diashau appears to have a window with questions such as you want to have your Diashau. you can choose between the selected and all images of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">The OpenGL-transitions option in the presentation use very elegant images via OpenGL. however, you need to have a corresponding graph card, because otherwise the Diashau is very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The filename option ensures that the filename of images in the left corner is displayed during the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">The loop loop ensures that the presentation in a final loop is displayed. you can then break manually with Esc;</seg>
<seg id="889">The images can be randomly select that the images are displayed in a random order. so it will not be used the sequence of images in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">Under delay between the images can be set between the individual images. 1500 milliseconds match 1,5 seconds and are a good default. the best distance depends on your computer and the selected transition effect. you ought to test this so before you show the presentation your friends!</seg>
<seg id="891">There are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can choose. randomly chooses a different effect between each transition between the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="892">During the Diashau you can connect to a toolbar at the top left screen. move the mouse into this corner for you.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this toolbar you can hold the presentation and start to start the previous and start the next image and stop the Diashau.</seg>
<seg id="894">At the lower bottom screen of screen, you can see the current filenames, the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">The KIPI module time & date has no documentation. if you are interested in writing, please contact the mailinglist of the KIPI Teams under KDE-imaging @ kde.org. Note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>

<seg id="907">If you want to enter a character sequence or descriptions of the images according to this text, you can also select a date of the file, thus e.g. 1971, or the complete date. you can also use one area of two dates, such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the bottom part of the window you can browse all pictures according to certain name, as you can see in the picture. here, on which Jesper, but not Anne Helene are depicted.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user manual for & photo album; if you like to read manuals, but rather to try functions, have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the homepage of & kphoto album; and look forward to the fast, the screen photos and the introductory videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & photo album; and select the first dialog, if you start & photo album; for the first time, or select the menu entry to the menu entry; or select a few example images, and you can try the functions of & photo album; try out.</seg>

<seg id="917">& photo album; provides you two ways to create HTML pages with your pictures. it is integrated in & photo album; integrated and the other as module available (see). in the following part of the user manual, you can create and retrieve it via the HTML File menu.</seg>
<seg id="918">Before HTML pages are created you have to set some settings. these are split into the three areas of content, layout and destination. in the following field, each area is described.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, enter the title of the superstale and a description that should contain the HTML file later. on photo album; HTML example pages do you see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, you can choose whether a & photo album; export export file is to be created on the heading page. how to find export information about export files.</seg>
<seg id="921">For example, you can select which information is displayed on the HTML pages. for example, you can avoid information displayed on the HTML page. for example, all pictures are exported. you can not use this setting to hide certain pictures before specific viewer.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this section you can define how the HTML pages should look like. most setting options are unique, which is why not specifically received in this area.</seg>
<seg id="923">Below on the page you can watch different resolutions for the images. thereby, those who have to view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution of 800x600, no pictures more download, for example a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">You can change the resolution at any time you can change the resolution at any time. it can thus browse your images with low resolution, as well as a larger transmission time, it changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setting area you place the various folder and URL where your website is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">At best, select a basic folder for all your HTML files and for each subsequent set of a new subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="927">First, you will need to select the main folder where all your images are stored. this folder will be stored and select the default location for all future images. here you can select either a folder or a folder from KDE, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your images, you can check if this really are all for viewing, a web browser, after the pages were created, the URL you should be set here. otherwise the web browser should start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files created by you do not need to copy it manually in the final target folder, check it manually. thus, you need to specify the final target of the files. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the base folders in which all sub-folders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The just described options described here have all three to basic folders or URLs. in these, a sub-folder will create, whose name you can define the folder folder.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you're looking at a family celebration, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & photo album; if you want to view a HTML page for viewing the images, you would like to go on the pictures, recording, etc., then you have to do with & photo album; this work must not even make.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & photo album; you can export a copy of your images into a .kim file. you can import other into your database. the bilites are imported with ex- and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim -files, internal and external. they distinguish themselves if the images itself is stored in the file, that you can have all pictures together, and this file can be saved as independent. the obvious disadvantage is however the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can select a .kim file directly from the menu file exporting... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file along with a HTML file, this is an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">One external .kim file searches the images on two times. first, the images that are given in the file of .kim -file. if you are searching for creating the HTML files, it is possible only if you have created your .kim file using HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">The following is described in the following dialog for exporting images which allows you to export over the menu file...</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is to act whether internal or external .kim files should act. there are the following three selection options available:</seg>
<seg id="938">To copy manuals to the .kim file, you need to copy the images in the same folder as the .kim-file.</seg>
<seg id="939">Copying the .kim file to copy the .kim file to the .kim file, you can copy the images automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim -files are normal Zip files. as most images are already compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small it is usually worth to compress the files. if you want to compress this, then simply select the export file.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is maximum image size limit. if you would like to send your friends, as the .kim file would not be very large. here you can limit the size, by example you can say that each picture is at most 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you select a file with the Enter .kim from the web browser or from the menu file importer... select & photo album; the exported database as described in.</seg>
<seg id="943">The Assistent for importing consists of four steps. first, you need to select which pictures you want to import them, in which folders should be copied to import pictures.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you can personalise the category persons of the import file (if you are a Dane), while this category is asked for your database. therefore, you will be imported into the third dialog window that are to be imported into the following categories of imported file and correspond to these categories in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step, you can check the categories of the imported file with the categories of your current database. one example will see you on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="946">It must be simple to browse images and look: if you see images, you would like to see images of your Italy's vacation and see a picture with your friend, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is shown.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual you will find the information about your pictures (1) the information about your pictures, over (2) the search and look, up to (3) advanced topics and adaptable options.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoalbum was started as a program to manage your pictures. but it was extended and today it takes care. in many places in this manual will be spoken about images but frequently, this also closes videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& photo album; stores all of its information in the dx.xml file and saves you with a program of your choice, e.g. Normal backup tools, copy to a disk or revisions in CVS where you want to secure.</seg>
<seg id="950">& photo album; remembers the folder where your images are stored and used this with future Starts; if you want to start another folder with images, you can start & photo album; with the option -c. as an example: photo album -c ~ / Company / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Via the menu entry settings; set up... proceed to a window, with which you can change the settings of & photo album; change in the following section of the user manual you will be explained in the following section of the user interface.</seg>
<seg id="952">On the left you can see six different icons with which you can claim a preview of Preview and options for viewing the viewer. for each setting, you can call a button transfer to the F1 key and a click on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">It was described here as you can create several features for each picture, e.g. persons, locations and tags. you can also create your own groups such as objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">To see the dialog, which is used to process existing groups. for any existing group you can select a label and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section subcategories, subcategories have already mentioned. in the dialog, you can address complete member groups, i.e., all members of a group set up once in a group instead of all groups of a central glides as in.</seg>
<seg id="956">In view, you can see the setting options, which you want to configure the member groups. in the left window versions, you can select the category with the current category and in the right a list of subcategories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& photo album; the modular system with other graphics applications, such as digikam and Gwenview. this modular system is called KIPI and means & KDE; image plugin interface. you can find on the homepage of Kipi.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be called upon the menu modules. the modules can not be described, as it can not be distributed as part of & photo album; but most modules have a help-page you can use via the modules itself.</seg>
<seg id="959">As the modules of multiple applications can be used together, it can be able to test the modules with & photo album; only very little modules can be first tested with the command &gt; kphotoelectric Album -Demo &lt; username\ &gt; or via the menu Help. do not say, I would not have warned you!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that use the modules over KIPI, are very different, making it possible that some modules with & b photo album; do not work. this is the disadvantage if you share functions with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & photo album; and other applications that also use KIPI, is that the other applications can not support their images in albums; this kind of order is not supported, simulates it for some memory modules, so you can use the functions with & photo album.</seg>
<seg id="962">This is simulated & photo album; the current album, which corresponds to the current view, so all images that shows the picture preview at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="963">In addition to the current album, & photo album; the modules also has a list of albums. here goes & photo album; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & photo album; s browser shows the contents of a category, for example all people, then each entry of this category is an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or the category will be used as a category for virtual albums. if you use the category for virtual albums, so if you wish to use the category persons, so if you had selected persons to view and to view it.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & photo album; you can not be compatible from the list of modules. start the dialog box and select the modules installed in the modules installed.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example of a starting screen as soon as you & kphoto album; starting with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you can see it from any other KDE application, you can see above an menu and a toolbar. in the toolbar, you can see any information about your pictures. in the section, we will show you back on this window, but now just click on the entry pics, which shows you an overview of all existing pictures.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main features of & photo album; is the possibility to view any image with notes. if the image has been recorded separately or for a larger number of pictures specific notes. if shown on all images Jesper is depicted and all pictures in Copenhagen have been taken.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these notes may be used for searching and Browse, as you can read in the section. if you want to check this comment when you use the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">In view three lists with a text field by using persons, places and search words. these are a very important part of & photo album; as you will always use it again if you want to enter information about your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is the postpone of the pictures within the list: if you have a family celebration, and on all 50 pictures, the same 5-10 persons can be mapped, this means that the used names are moved up, can be found faster and arrange.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to get a alphabetically sorted list, click on the symbol for sorting after date under the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you want to select any notes for each picture you would like to edit any selected pictures and add these pictures with notes. Click on the right and back buttons which are located under the preview of the picture on the right.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have several pictures, e.g. with the same person, then it can be more convenient to mark all these pictures and add the menu item multiple entries to once with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all available in the USA. there are also San Francisco and Los Angeles in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">On the picture you can see a browser window of the United States as a surgroup. in order to show you it is a overlap, a special symbol will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of the feature dialogs it is possible to add an entry into a pre-existing or subcategory. additionally, you can also go to a category and place this entry to a subcategory of this entry. attention, this assumes that you just sort your categories in alphabetical order.</seg>
<seg id="979">"" "" "" "you can move the individual elements of the feature dialogs by clicking the cordial that form the upper edge of the frame, click" "" "and you can also make your own window by using it outside the window range." ""</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adapted the look of the window that you are adapted to your needs, click on the button options..., which offers you the opportunity to save the current setup and the look of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also leave a frame. if you want to finish this window later, use the button options... and here a window appears. this process can be seen in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you want to view images in browser, you will find an overview with preview images of the currently selected pictures, or all images, if you have no filter. you can easily configure the size of the mouse, simply follow the mouse with the middle mouse button. try it just once.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you have an image on the background of your desktop, this image will be set up as background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">Once you click on a picture, this is shown in the picture viewer. if you have no windows open with a picture viewer, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can delete pictures in the picture shows. just select the corresponding pictures from you want to delete and press the Edit menu button or select the Edit menu. now you can see the window that you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& photo album; you can also use a solution for this problem. you can also use & photo album; you can also use the images somewhere else. in the picture you can see images of & photo album; if not all the photos can be loaded from the hard disk.</seg>

<seg id="988">As you see this function you need to copy files from folders and to copy it again. if you want to avoid the inserting of the respective CD. if you want to avoid any other hard disk images, please buy a larger hard drive to save all pictures.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the menu pictures you can find a sub-menu with the name privacy. if you want to have a little more privacy, filtering the images so that you can see any images that may see your little sister, and choose the menu entry All except for current view.</seg>
<seg id="990">With this, you have set that images in the case of the Feverything should be hidden. if you have blocked your little sister, just select the images that you have blocked, when you want to get blocked, click on sperre.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to set a password to unlock the images to unlock the images. to create this password, select your password in the menu privacy.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please remember that this picture protection isn't sure to read or delete all the images on the hard disk and the other, which can be found on the file dx.xml. this kind of password protection is only intended to read the password with & photo album; not very familiar to hide the look at private images.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason why you have all your pictures with & photo album; manage and watch over hours of course you want to describe them sometime. from this reason, it has a photo album; from this reason, you can preview it from preview, as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">The viewer can be seen in view of course. it shows the picture, but additional all the information about the image, such as who is on the picture, when and where was it done, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If the Infobox on the upper part of the picture you want to see, so you can easily remove what information is displayed and if any information can be displayed on the viewer. all these options are available upon the viewer. all these options are available after a right click on the viewer.</seg>
<seg id="996">Some words in the Infobox are underlined. if you click here. if you click on Anne Helene, the browser shows you all pictures of Anne Helene. as if you had selected persons from the browser and then Anne Helene selected.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have uploaded multiple images in the viewer, you can switch between them and upload the keys image high and picture. you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos1 and end. these features are also available from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If several images are loaded on the viewer, you can download this as a Diashau. & kphotoelectric Album; then you can download it a new picture after a few seconds. how often it can be controlled by clicking the Ctrl's Ctrl button; S.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful ability of the viewer's image album is to switch to the screen mode. in this mode, the viewer uses the complete place on the screen. simply use the input button to switch and back to the screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1000">If you use the viewer in the image, you can simply use a rectangle with the mouse button. with the Minus button, you can return rauszooming The plus button zoomt is shown in the center of the picture. shows how a zoom rectangle is marked and displays the results of ZOOMS.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the point-button you can reset your zoom, so that the image will not be shown on the ZOOMS, so that each pixel corresponds to a pixel image of the image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zoomoperations that work in videos do not work with the Plus- and mini-button.</seg>
<seg id="1003">You can turn the image from the context menu. this does not work with videos. you can do notes on the actual picture with the menu item notes from the context menu.</seg>

<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to get a number of images to a printer to get the images on paper. in order to see what photos you can start the viewer with the pictures and do it as well or bad, while you can view one after the other.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above you can view the viewer's possibility to view images with features, while you can view them. features are the letters A to Z and you can press a feature that you can check the corresponding letters. in order to see the features A, B and C.</seg>
<seg id="1007">Once you have set features on your images, you can see them in your browser. if you have all pictures you edit, print, or whatever you have selected, simply add a module to copy the selected pictures to a CD or whatever you want.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and especially characteristics can be displayed in the preview view. if you can view categories in DRE, then you can press features to the pictures by pressing the letters for the feature, after the image was chosen. this can be seen here:</seg>

<seg id="1021">If you work a texture or a part of a texture, you can view a preview of Featography View.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Press preview in the self-image view and a small example of the scene is made with the chosen texture. if you want to have one part of texture (for example a texture within a texture Map and not the whole texture Map), cross to local.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screenshot shows the control points of the camera. you can pull this control points with the mouse and change the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">If a transformation is chosen, the control points and it will display a small cross in the wire-line view. this cross marks the center for scaling and rotation as well as the position for pushes. you can change the shift by pulling with the mouse within the entire window.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object has a wire level of line level. you can only specify this value relative to the visibility level or as absolute value. objects are displayed only if they are selected or equal to the visibility of sight of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a window order as a default setting. the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you don't want to save the standard window order, or if you need another arrangement, you can save them. you can also save several window orders and switch between different regulations.</seg>

<seg id="1035">If you have a scene, you can rench them. & kpovmodeler; used & Povray; 3.1g to renders, this program needs to be installed properly. as this handbook was written & Povray; 3.5 currently. this version is not supported in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0 does not support.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To renver the current scene, click the Symbol Renders icon in the toolbar or select the menu entry view.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A Render mode conforms to entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and quality of renders. if you want to insert a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can add many Render modes, from a fast preview to high quality images in highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the symbol The Render settings in the toolbar or in the menu View Render modes... choose the following dialog:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each Render mode has a name. you can choose any name, but it's a name that lets you recognize the characteristics of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the box card size you can enter the width and height of the picture in the picture. if you want only a small section of the image, select the check box and enter the image section to renders in the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In combination with quality, you can choose the properties tab, the & Povray; for renders. this goes from a very simple colour and light model to a model with complex diffuser Reflection lighting. a detailed description of the Render characteristics can be found in the user manual & Povray;</seg>
<seg id="1042">If a picture is drawn up with only one beam each. these pictures often have a moirè samples or stud effects in curves and lines, sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel. this effect is called aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; used a technique called anti-aliasing, to reduce the influence of this mistake. generally images with this feature is better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">If you turn off anti-aliasing, calculates and connects & Povray; more than a beam per pixel. this technique is called super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. as standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because each pixel is still divided and adaptive because each pixel is still divided and adaptive because each pixel is dependent on the calculated color values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you select the first method, POV-Ray passes a beam each. if the difference between the shades of pixels with super-sampling. if you want to adjust the default value to 4, a grid of 4x4 will be calculated additionally, at a depth of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional beams per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixels, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:</seg>

<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 beams per pixel. if the difference between the color values, then the pixel is divided into 4 subpixels, which can be used individually and tested on a further subdivision. the maximum depth of records can be set to the depth.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another possibility to reduce aliasing effect is the generation of noise for the beam process, called Jittering. if you switch jittering, changes & Povray; the beams around a tiny amount, to avoid regular pattern.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for the quality of the renderns is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental feature of & Povray; the diffuse light reflection are calculated. it takes a very long to calculate a scene with this feature.</seg>

<seg id="1066">Larger values result in a more accurate wire model and therefore a better nails for the shown objects, but require more time to renders. for some objects such as the sphere can be set to the detailed level for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you cross the highly detailed projections for extended projections, all the wire model is used, all projections are used, with exceptions from perspective and performers. this feature provides a better approach for projections, but requires more time to renders.</seg>

<seg id="1070">If you disable the edge of the scenes, the non-recursive antialiasing method for the renders of scenes can be used. the values for depth and vibration value can be adjusted. more information on parameters you will find in section Render modes.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page you can change the existing window orders or create new window regulations. in the window sakes section is explained, as you can create window orders and store them.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The combination field of standard window order: displays all existing windowels. & kpovmodeler; used the selected window order in the start of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list of revised windows orders show all existing windowels. a new arrangement allows you to create and delete a selected arrangement with the button.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Every window order is identified by the name. the name must be clear and may not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list below shows all views of the selected window order. new views can be created with the button and remove select Views on the button Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The position of the new window. with new column you create a new column on the right side of the existing window, with card card you can see a map postcard view together with the previous image, but creates a separate window in the main window, but it creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you have just & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installed and now you want to start without more accurate knowledge of the two programs. if you're able to create all the steps in this guide, you should be able to create the ultimate but easy scene with beginner: a ball on one level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should carefully consider the following warnings before you should make sure that you use as a result only a black screen. if you use a 3D program for the first time you should consider this important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you don't set any camera, no rules can be applied for the renders, as a result, you can get a black image.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you insert no light sources, your whole scene is in the dark and you will get a black image.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have all installed incorrectly, you can see at the first start of & kpovmodeler; the following default window order:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to know the menus and the existing symbols of the toolbar. read the documentation, so you can get a reasonable performance that you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will need to use this menus and symbols now, so you should remember the menus and symbols and also their applications.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. in order to follow these instructions, you need to remove all objects from object tree. mark the scene and then select the menu entry to edit. so you have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire-line view shows how the camera shows the whole scene that you create. in particular, you can notice the scene from the scene from the view of the camera. this is showing the outcome of the scene from the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the designation camera. if you click on it, see the contents of the view object properties, where the various parameters of the camera will find. in the user documentation to & Povray; you will find further details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Change nothing to the basic settings of the camera, this is later reserved, but note that the camera has changed in view control points, with which you can change the target point of the camera. just click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired place.</seg>
<seg id="1088">If you press the button to press or the entrances, the wire model Views and the object tree immediately change these settings. as a result, they see the scene from the viewpoint of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the ground for the scene. for example, you could add a Quader (inserting the body Quader) and the size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a comprehensible method to solution this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; offers actually a simpler way. you can use an infinite level as the floor:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the level in object tree, change the name and press the button User or the entrances. in the object tree, the new name will be displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire model shows now also shows the plain, although at the moment only a limited level. if you renaissance the scene, the level up to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If you can see the object tree exactly, you will find the entry for each new object: scaling, rotation and shift. select one of these options, change the possible settings in the view of the object properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene you should shift the soil to exercise a unit under the horizontal line, just so you want to know some of these parameters. choose the shift and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">Select the floor only to adjust its material properties. there are many different materials, but choose a little bit Easy.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases a dialog, where you can choose to select how the object is to be inserted. please select the name in the proprietary image (name = bottom pigment), with a click on the button preview it looks like the pigment now.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the preview of pigments only shows a matte black material because you can download the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview. now there are many ways you can now, but take the easiest way.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you are looking in preview no color on quader and sphere, click on the user button and then call the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is right now. if you are now with a click on the symbol, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course, this is not the colour bends. here you need to set two new attributes (you can do this entry). then you can do this entry twice (you can do this also more frequently, but the chess boards can be used only with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">In object tree every time, select the colors in the object of object properties:</seg>
<seg id="1102">This step, you should already run, as you should understand the basic working method of & kpovmodeler; the ball is just as easy as the ground:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the object properties you can immediately change the settings. set the value for the radius. otherwise, the ball rotates contact with the ground. otherwise the sphere would be pumped over the floor, as you would have postponed the soil to a unit downwards.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, the renders now yields a rare result: as already before, the ball surface appears like a matt black material. set in the following step a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have selected the ball, you can now add a material now. as at the bottom, give the ball a pigment as color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Choose First subobject and change the name for example in sphere pigment. Click on ball pigment, then select one-colour and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can achieve even more interesting effects, if you take the time to set some finish properties:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values as in the following screen photos and click on users or press the entrances.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The brightness of shine effect and reflection are already partly good visual effects, perfect for glass or chrome surfaces, even if metal is not selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression that provides you & kpovmodeler; and hopefully you have learned so much, that you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytracygen is a Render method to create a two-dimensional scene of a three-dimensional scene or one model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">If you have a scene raytracing, the renders hypothetical Rays from the view of the viewer. the Render is calculated, such as this beam is reflected in the scene, and like atmospheric effects of light sources, such as fog. so the scene pixel is processed for pixels.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you will see without a camera, the camera is your eye, with which you can see the scene. without a light source, it is simply black. obviously, any scene needs to be rendered, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>

<seg id="1125">A Bump-Map is a possibility to customize rough surfaces without any ferves on the surface individually and without changing the geometrical form of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is common to use the same file both for Bump-Map as well as for a texture Map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic body are simple geometrical forms which you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these fundamental body. these models are then processed to give them a realistic look.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture Map is a possibility to give the surface of an object color to pixel basis, by application of a image file as color card.</seg>

<seg id="1183">The DCOP-Interface of Amarok has many general functions which are mostly seen in other KDE programs. this section consists of six parts, and should describe the DCOP functions of collection, context-browser, player, playlist, playlist and scripts. a sample call for the DCOP function could be pause & zb; like this:</seg>
<seg id="1184">Amarok supports command line options of Qt and KDE; in addition Amarok has some own command line options.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should give the user a feedback if the script may not be executed because of a lack of dependency. please check if all the modules are present and use the dialog, so that the user does not run a script.</seg>

<seg id="1188">Using DCOP, your scripts can be exchanged with Amarok and Amarok. the simplest way is the use of the command dcop; which should increase every KDE installation.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripts allow to execute external programs and commands. this is usually the function exec (). in this way, dcop &gt; is relatively easy to be called. here, an example in Python:</seg>

<seg id="1244">Some features such as the OSD require that your window manager keeps the relevant standards of freedesktop.org, but Fluxbox will work on all platforms. we are trying to support amaroK on all platforms, therefore we use Kdelibs and Qt, because these are able to provide excellent development environment.</seg>

<seg id="1511">Opens the main setting dialog of & kaudiocreator; with different cardboard cards (such as Encoder, to set the Encoders). this way you must go before the program can be used successfully!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes audio quality, body and compression rates and helps you choose the right Kodierers choice.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is to be lost, a lossless audio format is needed. besides FLAC there are others like 'shorts' or 'Monkey' which may be available for these distribution. the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats, you lose information through data compression according to their psychoacoustic model, MP3 and OGG is the most common. OGG mag is a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but the differences are less important, since both coders are very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'Not so 'free, lame is supplied with most distributions free, but there are open licence questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high up to very high sound quality (at high bit rates), but compared to OGG slightly deeper quality at lower rates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is one of the computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG-playing devices are available.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music is also owned on other devices such as standard DVD player, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard disk) or special car stereo systems. today - early 2009 - support these devices usually only the MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of parameters to audio quality and resulting compression ratios for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for further parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting gives good transparency of most people and most of music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= This setting should usually offer most people and most music pieces of acceptable transparency, and has already high quality. good enough for hi-fi systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset Extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. requires up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and somewhat less for less complex parts of the product. good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. needs 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a titels. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h '= 128 kbps CBR joint stereo, compression rate approximately 11. 128 kbps for all pieces of a titels. good enough for music from adolescents, portable devices and autotestosterone plants. but not good enough for better fi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting is exaggerated for most people and most environments absolutely exaggerated, but if you absolutely do the absolutely highest quality, without view to the file size, then select this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information, manually entered or via the program automatically via the Internet, are available as a list of parameters. it can be used as a list of parameters. it can be used with & audiocreator; and to create the file name as well as the characteristics of music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with Kodierprograms there is often a combination of program settings for the coaster and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the codiers explain the switch for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example to add the & CD; title to the keywords (English: day) if MP3s with lame is encoded, the switch -tt of lame and the title parameters of & kaudiocreator must be added; the result looks as follows: '... -tt {Stop}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudiocreator; parameters that can be used (= button designation in the assistant):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the FreeDB file is: a free database, in which persons can read the audio CDs, the information can be downloaded, so that all other these information can be downloaded from here: & CD; titles, artists, names of the pieces & etc., not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I'm not lawyer. however, nobody can prevent or get information on the & CD; however, nobody can prevent any information on the & CD; but all the information can be done by a & CD; business, physically or virtual.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & audiocreator; it is active to choose a check box (sending an address). in this type of configuration, it seems that the e-mail address will not be used when the server is not used (This can only know the programmer that has the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">In many countries, copies of the main database. if & caudiocreator, the geographic will be used to use FreeDB; this saves bandwidth in the network and resembles the load between the computers.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to Friedb.org provides a current list of mirror vern for online demand of & CD; information during reading a & CD; alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which reading program is used to store pieces from the & CD; to save WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There is rumor that cdparanoia is used to search in the source code.... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD; s. to note that the cdparanoia package from the appropriate distribution must be installed first if this is not yet done.</seg>
<seg id="1537">For saving the stored WAV files, the coaster and that the desired file format can be selected. during the first opening are the predefined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (a lossless compression for audio data). other coders can be added on this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Kodierer package must be installed from the respective Linux distribution prior to the coaster. this is also necessary for the predefined Kodiers. more information about Kodiers are in chapter Welcher Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a Kodierers more information about his switches can be obtained through the input of a command like lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console). it must be replaced by the name of the installed Kodierers.</seg>
<seg id="1540">This may have many causes. check the device name of the & CD; / DVD drive, writing and whether both cdparanoia as well as the audio coaster of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for OGGs). try to retrieve both programs with a command line in a terminal. this could give a note that which is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you don't want to read a copy protected audio CD; check the shell of the & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter by step by step example. even if you use other settings, this tips can be submitted to how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">If you read the complete manual, everything understood but somehow are still uncertain what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will prepare enough information to create those areas that you want to make the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time, everything is set up and our first & CD; we'll be able to create MP3s with a VBR (variable bit rate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3v1 sample words (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">There must be cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be installed as a pre-compiled package for your Linux distribution as it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd is made and that you own write permission (eg; try to copy with the cross-section).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section deals with basic setup of & kaudiocreator; something which is probably only done once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the approach to read a & CD; what needs to be repeated for any out & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the data compression of music (lame) and audio format (MP3) as well as the resulting audio quality (MP3) as well as the resulting audio quality (MP3) as well as the audio format (MP3) as well as we are lazy to use the program to download the FreeDB file to download the & CD; download data from the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings anytime, we'll be very likely to read on any reading of a & CD; if once the matching settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name will be handed over to the reading program to read the & CD; -data / pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Frequently, / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your drive. if this is not working or if more than a & CD; / DVD drive can also be accessed using existing entries, such as / etc / frod and an attempt to download existing entries for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The map controller General settings. here it's not much to do. here, an additional conversion will be defined. in our example, everything will be bellow as shown in the screen photo.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only For incomplete information may be found, so that you will be informed when data is missing (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1555">The ticket card CD; settings. simply select both entries. we are comfortable and let the & CD; data automatically download via the Internet from a FreeDB computer.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the calculator must be connected during the reading of the & CD; connected to the Internet, so that it can access to the FreeDB server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection box is simpler, a & CD; entry is found immediately, if you are later unsatisfied with the database entry and the filename or filename files can be easily changed. the directory and filename is changed, and the ID3 Tags with Kid3, the & KDE; tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, if you want to enter all manually, the selection fields and FreeDB file would not be used. however, you can select the database fields. however, you can select FreeDB in off-line mode, at least the first selection criteria must be selected, at least the first. the mode is set up on the following card card.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is for us FreeDB. these are settings for the retrieve of the & CD; information from FreeDB server on the Internet. how to know the system which data can get the CD? read the section about FreeDB. do all such as shown in the screen photo.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we don't have downloaded the database, we want to work only with the remote database on the Internet Server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB server: please go to page freedb.org and looking to a mirror server in your vicinity. on this way the load between the computers will be distributed as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both will function equivalent to the server, as much as many firewalls exist the protocol 8880 standard, maybe more luck with the protocol 80, as the & HTTP; protocol usually is open to surf on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example, we want to transfer any & CD; data to the FreeDB server. the first check box should be enough.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Simply take the settings of screenshot. (make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of simultaneous pieces: apologies, is there a reason why more than one at the same time when using only one existing drive? parallel reading and encode? the author knows not so easy to try.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; after reading the latest pieces: take this to the & CD; at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">Custom files for temporary files: if you can present this folder, then the path / folders can be stored in which the WAV files can be stored. if you don't have space on another drive, you will not forget that folder if you want to make something with the WAV files.</seg>
<seg id="1568">Everything is as shown on the screenshot. the command is somewhat long, under circumstances require something to the right and to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset Extreme 'defines the audio quality of MP3s. as previously mentioned, this is a very good audio quality, even for very good HiFi stereo systems. it's a good balance factor is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and storage consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for the limitation of production of tags on version V1. Kid3 is an excellent 'id3' tagger for & KDE; in case of subsequent modifications of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the names of the inputs (including the complete path) and the output file (including the complete path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Use the rest as in the screen photo. some comments for future use outside of this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of simultaneous WAV files: with a Dualcore or Quadcore or even a multiprocessor machine can be tried to encode more than a WAV file simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1573">This is what we have just finished the basic setup of & kaudiocreator; this configuration will be used as standard for any reading of a & CD; if you have chosen the organisational structure of your music, you'll never need them to change.</seg>
<seg id="1574">This section is described as the process of the reading of the & CD; we will be able to create files on the hard disk. first, we will be able to recover files on the hard disk. first, we will be able to recover files from the FreeDB file. the process of which is described in this section has to be repeated for any out & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we have a & CD; the screen photos are not included a little different than those for a & CD; with successfully supported by FreeDB files. hence, you will learn the & CD; data are manually entered, instead of using the Internet. comments are displayed on the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Try not to find the & CD; this example is a 'special' edition of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this has not been done, now the & CD has to be defined in the drive which has been defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment, pieces and its length should be listed in the window as shown in the screen. this only if the & CD; as audio CD; identified and can be read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this is not done, you are looking for questions and answers after the help or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the & CD; successfully used by the FreeDB file, all titles of the pieces are already completed and in addition, the name of the artist and the album will be shown.</seg>
<seg id="1581">For the case that there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; key to your & CD; there will be a window embedded, and you can choose the database entry, which your opinion is best on your & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you don't have the check box for the automatic query of FreeDB (on the page & CD; settings dialog for Settings), you can also solve this manually by choosing the first anopfs in the toolbar. if you pick no local database, but you need the connection to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 Step 02: the CD-Editor - input of CD data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; according to the pattern on the next screen photo. the title of the piece in the first row of the input field 'Update', the rest of the data in the input field 'Album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist must not be entered in the input field 'Update title' unless you have an arrangement with different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The lower comment field can be used for the individual comments of inidially per piece, the commentary box of the album is used for comments on all the pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after successful retrieval of data from the FreeDB file, the CD editor is not empty, but it does not only have a good idea to start the content of the CD player (e.g. whether all words with major letters or not...), but also to check whether there is any undesired remarks.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example we use ID3v1 tags. this is limited to the length of the fields on 30 signs for the artists, album and title of a piece and only 28 characters. this option is set up on the tab tab. take a look in the section 'basic settings'.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the day information of the generated files later at any time with the tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with him you can also create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags will not be supported by all codiers or file formats. see also in the help of Kodierer to get more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Just choose an entry, obviously with the style of the extended CD; in this example, this is not important, since we do not exceed the & CD; read the information about the categories. pop or Rap for example are under skirt.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After the election of 'OK' you come back to the main window. Click on the line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD-Editors appears again and you see that the fields for the album has already been filled with the specified data, which we wish for the first piece. enter the title of the item in any case and other information you wish.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next row in the main window and process in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window appears not when you have downloaded the data from the FreeDB file. it is already sorted into one of these categories.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the tool bar. note that the artist and the album will appear on the list of the list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there is a check-in before each line of a piece. only the titles are selected, or use the button All pieces select the bottom edge of the screen to select all the pieces at once.</seg>
<seg id="1598">By clicking on the button selection of the reading process, this window appears to confirm. on OK, then we will take a look at the window with entries and track what is running.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on a rider to turn off on the order window. it is in the left upper half of the window, directly under the buttons of the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window on control of orders. the first piece is currently read on the hard drive. the status of the program is displayed in the lower part of the window in the status line.</seg>
<seg id="1601">"" "this error message you will see if you are trying to work with a coaster which you have not installed yet. if they have not been encoded with a red 'X' in the list list." ""</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the TMP file and the target folder are not what we have entered here in example. have you checked if you have a write access to the folder for the temporary files and the target folder?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear that the error occurred immediately after the end of the reading of the first place.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The order 1 reads the first piece of which he is finished. but we have completed a new entry: this is the coding of pieces 1 into the format MP3. thus we read and coding parallel. note the status message in the lower part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has no configuration settings to read and encode the number of parallel processes. with high-weak machines, the calculator with an AMD64 seems to have no problem with simultaneous evaluation and encode (of however two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read, while another piece is coded, and a third order is encoded in the queue's queue. after the last piece is coded, a small window will be embedded in the upper left part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & caudiocreator; you need & KDE; 3.x. / 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to generate compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG, you need the Kodiers of your choice.</seg>
<seg id="1608">& kaudiocreator; if you have already known a pre-compiled package, as & caudiocreator, you can download from there an anonymous copy here. if you want to consult a anonymous copy there. if you read this package you have already done this package you have probably already done it...</seg>
<seg id="1609">This section is aimed at people who compile the source files, and not intended for users to use a pre-compiled package of their distribution.</seg>
<seg id="1610">If you are searching for assistance according to your needs, if it runs once, it is the following correctly for you:</seg>
<seg id="1611">A program that calls for many different programs, has many variations of settings. on the best, read the step by step example to know the options and settings. it shows screen photos of different map cards of the settings and also contains comments for options which are not used in the example.</seg>
<seg id="1612">Hello, still on reading? even if only the help menu was attached after the initial start of the program, no audio CD (especially if at the time of program starts no audio CD; in the drive), or from the unusually short menu?</seg>
<seg id="1613">What's it? who reads this, probably the program started. it should look something like this:</seg>
<seg id="1614">A bad example: unfortunately no e-mail. the author can't stop this manual. it is the first version for a manual to & audiocreator; let's do it. if you want to read and read this section. and if you read this section, he has undergone this section and is therefore agree with this suggestion.</seg>

<seg id="1624">First, you can open... from the menu file. it appears the usual file dialog, with whose help you can choose the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1625">You can also drop a file from a & conqueror; window will fall into the & kmid; window will also work with several songs simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To play a music piece, open it and confirm the button playing in the toolbar, select the entry check out of the menu piece, or confirm the empty button.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; one piece will start automatically, as soon as you go on the & kmid; windows. (with multiple pieces are added to a collection and played in succession.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">Once & kmid; one piece plays, you can jump on any spot by using the middle button of the mouse and drive to the knob.</seg>

<seg id="1632">In & kmid; you can set what the events will be displayed, and even better: the event type will be selected, so that you can select nothing manually. if you want to select the karaoke text, but you still have the possibility to change this if you want to see the other way.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to adjust a event type, select from the menu settings the entries text messages or lean experiences. the same function also have keys 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files which you can summarize, these will be played through the series. in this section, how you can use the collections.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, open the collection manager. this can be found in the menu collection under the point.... Click on New and enter the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy a existing collection by clicking on copying and then specify the name for the new collection. this collection will include the same songs like the original.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than a collection, you can set up the setups on a collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">In the temporary collection, all songs you want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When leaving the application, this collection is not saved. consider the if you add many pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, it must be selected in collecting manager. there you can add to a song. there is again the file dialog, with whose help you can choose the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song, depends on the attitude Automatic add to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">If automatic add to the collection is activated, a piece of opening (using file opening or drag & drop) is automatically added to the active collection.</seg>
<seg id="1643">If automatic add-on to the collection is not enabled, when opening a piece set the temporary collection, then the collection will then be added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you need to open the collection manager, select the collection and select the desired song and then click button.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order where the songs are played. if you select the series after the submenu sequence of the menus collections, the songs are played in the order, as they added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">If you add songs or remove or accidental order in the menu, the order will be set.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in collecting manager, or use the selection list above the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To jump to a song, select the button next song, the entry next song from the menu piece or press the arrow right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To jump to a song, select the knob piece, the entry pre-piece one from the menu of the menu or press the arrow on the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection, and click the button Delete.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be deleted. however, it doesn't matter when leaving & kmid; not stored.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizers, which are non-MIDI-compatible. in this case, the MIDI-Map General-MIDI events that understands the synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map that converts all the change of the Change patch to Bright Piano in events of the Change Change patch to Trumpet and thus always a trumpet snares if originally a piano should play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you only have a sound card, you don't need MIDI-Map because all sound cards GM are compatible (including Awe - and GUS maps, FM-devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">Sorry, there is no programs to create MIDI-Maps. you need to edit the appropriate file from hand (with your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI-Map is a text file, which stores all required documents for playing a unit.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may appear only once, except the KEYMAP section, which is so often appear as desired. the requirement for this is, however, that every occurrence has different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define KEYMAP "Name of Keymap"... END Define CHANNELMAP... END options... END...</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that dephins is needed to view that a section begins (except for options) and END, that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your Map file as an e-mail, so that I can offer in future versions of & kmid; support can not be compatible for devices that are non-MIDI compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section, the patch of General MIDI is shown on your specific keyboard. the general use looks as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the same sign is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are in the right order (from 0 to 127), you may not change the order and also no line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllKeysTo M will be used to insert all sounds that supports this instrument with number M (GM-Patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with tone 60) that can take you similar to the PATCHMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1664">For example, if a MIDI file is to play a note with Patch 127 (rifle), it takes a patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the tone 60, independent of which sound is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here with the term drum patch of patch, if any sound is a different perverse instrument (drum, cymbals, maracas & etc.), and not one that means the sound height of the same drum means (like him some keyboards).</seg>
<seg id="1666">KEYMAP section is needed to specify such as tones on a specific channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">Like the PATCHMAP section, the order of lines is very important, as well as their presence. you need to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define multiple Keyboards for each channel and you need to use several devices only in the first row.</seg>
<seg id="1669">In particular, Keyboards will be used to finish sounds on the perverse channel. check out as an example the supplied Keyboards.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to transfer some channels to others. if you want to exchange, if you want to exchange the first and second channel, take advantage of the CHANNELMAP -section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are useful for keyboards on a specific channel (General MIDI to Channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, built according to the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel, which is depicted on the Channel N. if you use the keymap option, the Keymap will continue to change all events that try to change the patch on this channel. in this case, patch is then used patch x.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch option can be useful to use the Perkussions-Patch on the perverse channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for Pitch Bender ratio are multiplied, in which proportion of Pitch Bender events can be multiplied by the value n, this is used with the formula n * (r / 4096) and then redirected to the value of 4096, so that in the map file is no decimal number).</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM is presenting a keyboard, which is a pitch Bender event to play a tone higher. unfortunately, some keyboards will be playing for two tones up to one octave higher. in order to try the right value on your keyboard, you have to try a bit with & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use an MIDI map, just open the MIDI settings dialog. you can find this in the menu under settings, point MIDI settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a wide range of claviatures (one for each MIDI channel). you can see that sounds are just played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel. if you have changed an instrument, the button is not changed green but red, to view that no more the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has (until now) two different views to view the played tones. you can choose the menu settings under the point channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The pace-LCD displays the speed, with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the pace of a song. if you find it, a song is too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the pace, use arrows to the left and right from the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file which contains information about how a music piece has to be played. it contains the notes, rhythm, speed, & etc; so it can lead the same MIDI file on two different devices, as well as two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Well, I can never compel to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while a mp3-file needs a similar sound quality. with a MIDI file, you can also change the individual instruments, speed & etc. you have the control of everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">That can happen if you compiled a binder distribution (rpm, deb) of & kmid; without AWE support, you need to download and install a source distribution (for example from kmid; 's home)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I don't want to add any files separately.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Understood, therefore supports & kmid; drag & drop. just open the folder you want to add in & conqueror; select all files from, and drag it to the & kmid; -window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">Previously, activate the attitude of automatic add to the collection. otherwise, files are added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can double the arrow on the left of the Tempo- LCD to slow down the playback. to restore the default tempo you can double to the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have played on a & KDE; -window with my MIDI file and & kmid; if I want to play a MIDI file (if I want to play a MIDI file) or if I want to play a file, only in the & conqueror; -window will change and drag the desired file into the window of & kmid;</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you want to listen to a file without taking them directly to a collection, switch the setup Automatic add to the collection, and the new; file will add to the temporary collection. opening files</seg>
<seg id="1692">Let's take you to play the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid., just want to play the first file. thus, set the setting automatic add to the collection and open up to A.mid. your temporary collection then contains exactly these a MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then you can connect, also B.mid and C.mid and create a collection of all three files. how do you do that?</seg>

<seg id="1710">It is possible to use the preferred connections under the menu bookmarks, but these are individual entries. if you want to create a list of entries that can be played after each other, then you should use the category continuous playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups to receive an additional HierArchiestufe. if you have an entry, its group and all its subsets are copied to the current category and play it with the attached entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' current pieces', television and continuous playlist can also be changed by a editor, but can also be changed by a editor, but also through the application itself. for example, the different files can choose from the menu View and the next processing mode. by clicking on a sub-group, only the XML content will be displayed by this part.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, you have to choose from the menu with playlist and choose either the processing mode, or select a different category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes are lost if the working mode is left or a different group will be selected without any playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">As a result of the convenience of the author of & kmplayer; some features can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation at starting and editing can be disabled by editing ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc and change from [General Options] No intro = 0 obiger option on '1'. if the option is not available, it can be simply inserted.</seg>

<seg id="1722">There is no rider for this rendition in the configuration dialog of & kmplayer; everything must be configured by manual editing of the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc. here is an example how a 'flash' is played with the squeeze-Mozilla with the module:</seg>

<seg id="1728">For configuring VDR (video data recorders) Settings in the kmplayer, the dialog box can be found in the settings under - &gt; Quelle- &gt; XVideo Port. you should be found out of which one will be selected. to reuse encoding (e.g. it is PAL for West Europe), the correct name probably contain a DVB.</seg>
<seg id="1729">As the VDR support of kmplayer can only use Xvideo (probably the only works only). this is also supported on the first screen (: 0.0). for this reason, the videoforlinux extension has to be functional for the X server. it is therefore necessary to be included in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config.).</seg>

<seg id="1761">All documents are usually divided into some elements. & Latex; encourage the subdivision of the document in the following items (part is the whole and subjective element):</seg>
<seg id="1762">With the view of the document in the structural view, the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a single mouse click on the respective section.</seg>

<seg id="1769">In consideration of the Edit toolbar, the three large-scale selection fields should be developed into the document. the first selection box is designed for fast casting of the document in parts, chapters, sections,... The available finalized & latex; commands for subdivision are:</seg>
<seg id="1770">The selection box is similar to the items of articles such as keywords, joints, or references. the options are:</seg>

<seg id="1776">The brackets according to the command\\ documentclass contain the settings for the command. setting the text [12pt] specifies the font. if the font is not specified at the beginning, this can also be done in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">As soon as the above mentioned source example, the & Latex; source code must be compiled. the simplest way to this is the use of the construction of building or the button.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be stored in front of compile. & kile; for storing the storage is automatically created.</seg>
<seg id="1779">The compilation of the document should be sought after errors in the protocols. when using quick construction, the eyepiece should be started automatically. if it is not the case, the log should also be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1780">A environment (English environment) is a text that will be treated differently than the remaining document. for example, the command\\ Begin {environment},\\ Huge and\\ end {environment) is to have a different font by the font in the environment "" "" Protected "" "" (English Huge).

<seg id="1781">The interests are only permitted within the vicinity (of\\ Begin {environment} until\\ end {environment}). there is no decision type (number) for free changes within a environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many denominations for an increase of readability and usability of the document. for example, certain fonts, fat printing, cranks, etc. these commands are either using the command\\ end or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ Begin {reception}: this command is closed for short, until he is closed with a\\ end {reception} or another environment. a single word in a set can be displayed with\\ emph {word}.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ Quote: created a quote in document. the quote begins with\\ Begin {quota} and ends with\\ end {Quote}.</seg>

<seg id="1786">As soon as the assistant, a little text was entered, a few adjustment for the better readability of the document should be done. this should be a quote, a few jobs in the fat and curve printing and a poem to the application to see the differences of these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document was viewed, it can be returned to editor or Ctrl Editor (at the internal viewer). at an external viewing, the window must be closed.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI; file created, the document can be printed or converted into a & PostScript; / PDF file can be converted. simply try and fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is a comfortable file format (English D e V ice I nd.). these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for the readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of .dvi Edition as printer, & PostScript; / PDF conversion or computer screens.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For printing a & DVI; file the same steps as for the compilation of the document (see). on the 7th step - after clicking on DVI, the document can be printed using the file (if the printer is set correctly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The conversion bar code displays the conversion of DVI; file into other formats. once the DVI; file from the & Latex; -Source can be created, the conversion can begin to recover different formats using the buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The detailed search for the direct jump from the editor to dawed position within the DVI; -file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& kile; provides a corresponding attitude for all & latex files; for this purpose, only Modern under Settings can be set up... tools of building views.</seg>
<seg id="1794">In order to be able to adjust the mouse, the mouse has to be positioned in a row of the source text and then connect to the background. the jump to the corresponding point in DVI; viewer is then sober.</seg>
<seg id="1795">Using this function in & eyepiece; document the corresponding & Latex; document the corresponding & Latex; document the corresponding & Latex; document must be specified in & eyepiece; used in & eyepiece; used as text editor (settings... Editor)</seg>
<seg id="1796">If the use of quick construction of the & DVI; viewer cannot be displayed, an error should lie. should this error be displayed in the log file or in the message window.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The log file extension refers to the error source in the source text. in the editor, the log file can always be clicked on the error. in order to consider the faulty line. in order to be clicked on the error in the protocols, jumps & kile; jumps to the error line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Once you clicked on the respective button in the toolbar, a window appears to choose the template for the document.</seg>
<seg id="1799">When selecting the empty document a document can be used either from the reason to new or the assistant to the fast creation of a new document. further information are included in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">Basic users of & Latex; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents. templates can be created in & styles; created, saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, either an existing & tex; - / Latex; file can be created or create a new file using the existing document and selection of file template from document.</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document by a new document, some character labels will be replaced by other data (e.g. name or character encoding). these variables can be set in settings... settings can be submitted.</seg>
<seg id="1803">In creating your own template, it is therefore necessary to know what character labels will be replaced by which variables:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $: this character string is replaced by entering the document class. typically they are using document class:\\ documentclass [$$DOCUASSOPTIONS $$] {4}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The simplest way to create a template is the use of the assistants and the therefore associated entry of the commands in Editor. once the document was created in this way, the following steps can be completed:</seg>
<seg id="1806">"" "when creating a new document then the own template can be filled instead of the standard equipment." ""</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any & latex; files will be created. a simple way to create a template should be searched for an internet and the steps described below are described above.</seg>

<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes any element in detail. everything about the possibilities and limitations is described in simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of an TagXML document. it can only contain once in a document. it can contain the definition of many tags but does not contain anything above itself.</seg>

<seg id="2024">The & descriptionrc; file is just fairly simple and there is a editor, accessible via DTD uses DTD settings; for a newly created & DTEP; for a newly created & DTEP; a simple & descriptionrc; should be created with the following entries:</seg>
<seg id="2025">[General] version = use 1 for & quantaplus; version & lt; = 3.1.2 and 2 for any higher version. name = DTD (/ / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional). if not specified, the name is used as Nickname.</seg>
<seg id="2026">A action can set to set up actions... to be created. Click on new action to the same dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2027">This action is assigned to the referee. with pressing the user-defined user can be assigned a keyboard player; with Kone is the current key pendant.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. it can be entered into the detailed settings and displayed this text in the document on the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful action type. using this action you can change external applications (typically scripts, but it is not limited) that can change the document or as input (or parts of the document); yourself are the quick start dialog or the various See in... actions for the (X) HTML-DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">The first must be specified as the name of the script and interpreter. example: SH / home / myHome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are permitted, it is recommended to use the% script.sh.In this way: $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / scripts in their path: $Path There are other special variable that can be used in command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we are replaced with the URL of the current document. in case of a local documentary file will be removed: / from the document name.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: is replaced with the PID of the current & quantaplus; trial is replaced by & quantaplus; only one instance is running, if DCOP is used to control the PID number; this is useful when DCOP is used to control & quantaplus; used by the external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameters for this event, usually the File Name of the current document or the path to project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the above mentioned methods, a script could take a script of & quantaplus; in the selection dialog box can be determined, which is to be sent to the default value. possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected section of the document is transmitted to the script. the% input variable is normally just with this attitude.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to the input, the output of the application can also be redirected. there are two types of issue, to the standard issue; error messages, which should be done with the default output text, which is set to the value of the selection list:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in Markup language, it is recommended to create the tags in logical groups. it is necessary to create a specific toolbar. in the case, it is not too many, therefore you can create a toolbar with the name of the market.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a tool bar is added, you must add the actions and configure. choose Settings actions.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are pretty self-explanatory. press the new action button at the bottom end of the window starts the editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill out all necessary fields and add the day to the matching toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete all, if the day has attributes and you are planning to edit, activate dialogue "day" when available, so that an input when using the action is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is the ugly symbol. who should remember the action in conjunction with this icon? we replace it before we have difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2044">For creating a symbol no means that the action will be better, we will use & kiconedit; select Other Programs (or where else it is located in their distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; used by default 32x32 pixels, but we need 22x22. to change this, select Edit size.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created symbol does not only help you to remember what the action does, but also all other users of the & DTEP;</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to the fact that the day is called, I decided to create a starting button as a symbol. by using green (green is usually interpreted as less, rigid, further interpreted), or should, at least, a message will be signposted on this symbol no more & lt; starting in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After the creation of the symbol no means it has to be connected to the action. this happens via the menu with settings... (in & quantaplus;) and selecting the desired action. next to the text box is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder where the stored icon is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the user button and continue with other tags, so it still gives, or confirm you to complete with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some usual & quantaplus; functions for tool bar, or should set it to a better overview through several separators. open the tool set via settings. make sure that the desired toolbar can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I would like to choose the separators (top left) for my tool bar. after selecting the element that should be added to the tool bar, press the arrow button to the right. this adds the element to tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">I want to preview a fast way to access the conqueror preview. I will select it and add to the tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note, as the separator support group. someone who doesn't know my tool bar could believe that the & conqueror; -button is the opposite of the start-button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested through Try of all symbols to ensure that everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Secure the right folder. after RebeXML does not exist, it will be stored in the right folder, but your tool bar (s) should be loaded in the right folder. please adjust their tool bar (s) if a file is opened from the appropriate type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the preferred extension of & quantaplus; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the script language or the formatting language which you like to do. this chapter describes how I create a & PHP; document-tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before you start your own documentation, you could check out & quantaplus; -Repository, whether someone has done this already for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first, you need to create a existent documentation for the formattainment / scripts / etc. then you need to create the docrc file. the first part we will be able to treat you the second.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE configuration file [Tree] Doc you = path, relative to this file, for example php42 / # Elements Section 1 = 1.html pages 2 = release 1.html pages 2 = release 2.html tag1 = tag1 html tag2 = tag2html tag2 = tag2html tag2 = tag2html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The tree defines the visible part of documentation in the documentation. for example, see in the & PHP; documentation as something:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE config file [Tree] Doc You = php42 / # top level element Top element = PHP 4.2 Documentation = Table of Contents = Reflex.html... Language Reference = Basic syntax,... Basic syntax = flat synchronous tax.html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this shows that it is a good place in the tree with its own content. there is no known limit for the chess table (except by reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the table of contents directly to a file is referenced (and consistent on the upper end of the module & mdash; file is displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces do nothing influence, but pay attention to & & lt; sign. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; resourcendatters will be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The content section is the area of docrc file which serves the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array _ array of documentation. there are only two types of entries here: the context menu (Context List) and file attachments.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of supporting separate context elements that should be available (for & PHP; these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can save your file docrc to store up to $HOME / .kde / Conanta / doc / Quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / doc / Quanta / doc for local and global use. then create a folder (as you specified this in your file docrc) and copy your HTML documentation there.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that these good and it is worth to be shared, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. which documentation were used to be done by the & quantaplus; -community. they are not rich, but are proud to be with the best web-development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus; you are not alone. it is possible to share the forged resources (DTEP packages, tool bar with actions, scripts, templates) with other parts. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can send an email to friends, partners or else to whom are sent. at different places there will send an email with email, tool bar toolbar with email, in context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded to our main archives, from where all other & quantaplus; -users can be reviewed and only available when our team is checked and made available to sign the resources, for which it is ensured by a GPG / PGP key, both for our team as well as for later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">While uploading you are asked after their Passphrase for their private GPG keys (the Passphrase will not be saved), or in the case that you may have one key. in the dialog New resource, you can continue to stay one. in the dialog box (URL preview can stay empty) and with clicking OK it will be started.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Uploading can also instantly upload the menus DTD DTD (DTEP) tool bar tool bar, and in context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading of a resource, before installation, examines & quantaplus; the integrity of the resource is warns and it can be lost. if the integrity were given and the resource needs to be signed, a message with the indication of the originator of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work on XML languages, which is currently not yet supported by & quantaplus; however, it can work timely, because hundreds of day files could be needed in tagXML format. there is simpler way to automatically convert a DTD to a DTD package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the menu DTD charging and convert a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description which should be used. afterwards, the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Objective: the newly created & DTEP; is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! Doctype definitions: the string that appear in! doctype tag such as HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / HTML4 / loose.dtd should appear</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine adjustment of the DTEP after conversion: if enabled, & quantaplus; after conversion the & descriptionrc; Editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this possibility.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus; there are some key concepts that make sure to understand and full use of & quantaplus; this chapter tries to develop exactly these concepts, without their understanding & quantaplus; little benefits.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus; the work area is divided into three areas: global, local and projection related. this distinction affects a series of components in & quantaplus;</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for everyone, the & quantaplus; uses, available as globally, in common stock structure of & quantaplus; saved. this enables the group of administrators different toolbars, actions and samples in the global tree, which are then available in each user-user environment.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web-development agent for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and tools. local elements are stored in the user directory, so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project related elements are only available within a specific project. this can be all done by & CSS; patterns can be specially designed for the files of a specific project. all elements are stored in the folder's tree-tree, which is the common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the editorial windows, the building views, the cartography with information and tool bar. please beat in, and for further information about these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click on the right mouse button to obtain a context menu with the right mouse button, such as close the current, other or of the cardboard, restarting or upload the document, jump to a bookmark or execution of CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right click in the editorial area lead to a further context menu regarding the processed document (cut / copy / insert), editing the file under the mouse, or open the file under the mouse button a file.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top end of the editors, the toolbars of the Editors are currently focussed, and quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional will be shown as a standard, for which a set of tool lines will be displayed. in the course of further expansion of & quantaplus; they are adapted to the new functions and therefore associated user requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of machine bends is really easy. if they want to insert it, e.g. & lt; then you can insert the data for this straight day, then you can insert the data for this straight day. if you want to insert multiple attributes (like anchors), you can fill in a dialogue with different fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The installation views (QIT;) enable it to open and streak in the information about & quantaplus; for files, project, pattern templates, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool, the & quantaplus; provided this view shows all files in the project using a right mouse click. actions like adding, remove, upload or deleting the files from storage media can be carried out with the displayed context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2093">A further possibility of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, program components, a whole website & etc. there are all options open.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided in three categories, depending on which connection it depends. global templates are still available, local templates only for the respective users and templates in projects are available in the project. more to templates are available.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you can find information on the available script. the concept of integration in Global, Lokal and Project works also here. by clicking with the left mouse button, you can download the available information to a script file, such as the script will be able to edit or send an email.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With this view, one shows the internal structure of the active document. by left-to a Elementes, the cursor opens on the position of the Elementes. by right-clicking a Elementes opens a list of commands in terms of navigation and view of the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears among the other buildings. with him, managerial Attributes and Namespace can change the protection of all available attributes with a few clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation for the web technology for your development. it can be downloaded documentation for & quantaplus; from the quantaplus; it can create your own documentation, and through adding a folder's doc to create project-specific documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus; two cartilreers at the bottom end of the window that can be reached via the useful information: the message window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This cardboard box shows information about each in Quanta running script. for instance, e.g. the DTD being used for the current document and all changes to DTD.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This cardboard box shows all the error in the current document. & quantaplus; -scripts that will be executed, give all error messages (such as there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantaplus; tool bends are extensive expanded and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and it will receive the corresponding command. the choices of the tool bar is the possibility to define own commands as symbols in & quantaplus;</seg>
<seg id="2103">A further function of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a toolbar with email. & quantaplus; sends the toolbar as a compressed Tar-Archive via & kmail; you can get them in & quantaplus; like any other backup and load!</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to adjust the place of & quantaplus; files on your system. this has autoconf a number of options to get to configure options. / configure --help. the options are easy to understand and not done here.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems when starting & quantaplus, you should check whether your path contains the & KDE; 3 am folder. also you should make sure that no older version of & KDE; 3 in the Path before her bin folders. the same applies to & Qt.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantaplus; is a web development tool for the KDE surface. & quantaplus; was optimized for rapid web development and combines a fully mature development environment with a wide range of powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">During an effort to create the best & HTML editor, the developers of & quantaplus began to deal with a close idea: what would be if & quantaplus; an independent, extended market-up languages? well, this would make him an absolutely great web development tool for & KDE; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer to pure & HTML; is limited & quantaplus; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. if you can define it & XML, then it should be & quantaplus; it should be the suitable & IDE;</seg>
<seg id="2109">Well, at the above mentioned claim must be noted that & quantaplus; as product is based on the outstanding efforts of the entire & KDE; rumour is not only possible, but it allows users and developers, & quantaplus; so to enlarge how they need it for their need.</seg>

<seg id="2183">The password will be kept in the core memory and be forgotten by program. this possibility is useful if common uploading files is necessary, and the rather unsafe password on the plate does not come into question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your opinion in front of the upload.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantaplus; many high-ladeprofiles can be uploaded and therefore the project (or parts of the project) can be uploaded to various servers. when editing or creation of a profile will be shown this dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2186">That is the name of the server that should be copied to files. either a fully qualified domain name or IP address work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for the uploading. the list depends on the version of & KDE; and the installed Kio slaves. at least you should choose from & FTP;, file (locally) and NFS.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for the transfer. usually, this must not be changed, except the network administrator operates a service on the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your attacking shaft, this is either a time-saving function or a risk. if your password is stored on the plate, so that it can't be easily read, but everyone can see it in clear text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is only one set of files and tool bar. it can be loaded in a project a lot of views, i.e. through simple diving views, you can load several files and toolbars, and replace the currently opened files and tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be opened in the menu project or the project toolbar, can be accessed via Settings tool bar toolbar, open or deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus; with which one has to do most. this helps not only increase productivity but also allows adjusting the adaptation of & quantaplus;</seg>
<seg id="2193">As already mentioned above, tool bends in & quantaplus; best possible on the menu tool bar. use and add tool bars can be treated below in the section of toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbars and symbols can be set either by context menu (right click on the toolbar), which will be able to set up other promotions such as toolbar, tool bar renaming or tool bar, which can be specified in the dialog, where can be able to be visible on these or other tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu on a toolbar (symbol) on a toolbar, additionally the entries must be removed and action displayed, which are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbars and the actions of them can set up in the menu with settings... and settings can be set.</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are in the essential document, code-Schnitzel and files for linking. & quantaplus; used templates as a common filesystem with advanced organization and interfaces. you can copy, move or any of the system available in the pre-level system. templates are in & quantaplus; in about restrictions that is presenting itself for the file system.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus; supplied templates have the conditions for their use. please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary is everything that is not pure text. it can be inserted any file except text, i.e. images, & PDF; s, flash files & etc. some examples are usually available in the pre-level under global templates. further information on templates is available in.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be created by any text document. on the basis of these templates, new documents can be created. usually, a simple rumor can be found in corresponding way to efficiently. some examples may be found under global templates. see also for more information on templates.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This type of templates is useful if not a new document should be inserted again on a template but the same text area can be found in documents through a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl. some examples are listed under global templates. see for more information on templates.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name suggests, this templates for all websites as templates. they are a collection of different documents, which can be organized in a folder tincture. there are no examples in a compressed tar archives. currently there are no examples in & quantaplus;</seg>
<seg id="2203">Create a document structure according to Belieben (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;) and choose File As template as a local template....</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once this is done, note that (even if it was stored as a project preset) the template is not visible in the project tree. check out in pre-tree under project templates.</seg>
<seg id="2205">In your document, select text in your document and store your selection to a selection of a local / project template. alternatively, the selection can easily be drawn with pulling and lay on the basis of building templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: the file can copy only in a pre-file folder. you can copy all file management functions, such as pulling, and insert or insert about the file tree of Konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">One can click on a folder to click on a folder on the right and to secure a folder to backup and secure a name for the template, but of course, it can be stored as a local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project preferences enable a very well-oriented approach. you can add headlines and footlines, or linked files, or linking them. in addition, some things can keep some things using templates very deep in mind.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The initial structure in the subwindow templates is based on the $KDEDIR / share / apps and $HOME / .kde / share / apps and files. each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers, such as above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To order to select the behaviour of a folder with the right mouse button on the folder and select the context menu tab. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection box with the three previously described types; files, text or templates. this selection is blown off, as soon as Elderly attributes are misulated.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is activated by default and fits all except the root folder. if a root folder would be set in principle, unless it would be explicitly enabled. in case of a normal folder would be enabled. in case of a normal folder would be activated. if nothing appears, you probably be in a stem folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows a set or tested text for templates in this folder. this could be general headlines or footlines for all templates into a folder with special headlines / footsteps a whole presentation already with the appropriate headlines / footlines.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Additionally, we have a full screen menu (pressing the right mouse button) over a full command collection for adding folders or copy and add templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; offers two modes: VPL; editor and VPL; & Source Editor, which can be reached via the menu View. the first mode replaces the source editor in two parts: the source editor and the VPL; Editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; Editor works as follows: he will load a document as a normal & HTML; - or XHTML; -page and a cursor appears. then you can edit and disable the source code editor in which the amended changes in the VPL; Editor is visible in the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; editor on a document, which contains & PHP; it is not possible to edit this directly with the VPL; Editor is not possible to edit this directly with the VPL; editor is still the source editor. there are no plans to change these behaviours.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode is just like the first, except for the changes both in the source editor and in the VPL; editor, this mode is active as well as compared to the active cursor from a window to the others, where the position is retained in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronization distance between the VPL; Editor and the source editor can be adjusted via settings.. After choice of VPL; View, the recommendation can be set automatically between synchronization after a click or automatically. in principle, the recommendation: a small span for fast computer and a large range of slow motion.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Suppose you want to change the title of the website, so it is possible to choose the documentation of invisible tags when working with the VPL; Editor is also called, as soon as a new document is created with the VPL; Editor is also possible to change the suspension of the hands.</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta-tags set up the storage of information about the document themselves e.g. tags for internet search engines. meta-elements can be added or removed. one click on the list allows changing the inhaltes, e.g. keywords on the column name and key keyword key.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way of design in the browser. you can add CSS rules using buttons under the list or delete. a change over the list is not supported using the meta-elements. editing of CSS rules is currently not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to insert a external CSS style selection by clicking on the file button and select the appropriate file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The use of cursors is as in a text processing, thanks to the arrows, possible. under rare circumstances, the cursor works as usual. text can be inserted as usual. text can be inserted by plugins and extinguish by pressing or distances.</seg>
<seg id="2225">The insertion of tags is done in the same way via the tool editor, as described in the source editor, e.g. if an anchor-day is inserted as an anchor tag, is encircled with text, each other surrounding anchors must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some tools such as the tables assistant or the lists of tables are disabled. they are later used in & VPL; do not work in this release, tables or lists of tool bar must be used.</seg>
<seg id="2227">& xsldbg; is a tool for investigation of styles. in contrast to other programs for styles, search for certain elements is possible and the execution of the styles can be pursued.</seg>
<seg id="2228">To compile & xsldbg; we need to compile, except & KDE; the libraries lixslt, libexslt and libxml, which are already available in a typical installation of & KDE; already available.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Stop in a template, placed on a spot in an area of xsldbg loaded styles or xml file or at current knots. new in xsldbg 3.1.4: in gdb compatibility mode, you can set points in a specific file and line number and later to be activated later.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Xsldbg determines the full path from a filename for a filenames. filename in the same folder as the top-loaded styles to work Folcon xsldbg is the following input possible for example: / en / xslack.xsl, the following entry is possible:</seg>

<seg id="2274">On systems with installed Readline library, you can browse through the arrows on / off by the data memory of the commands.</seg>
<seg id="2275">Multiple commands require more than an argument, to be used as an argument. & eg;: with the command "Break & quot; * _ BAR _ @ quot;" as an argument, set a holding point in a file named "Break & quot; * _ BAR _ @ quot;"</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools for the same. why so & kdiff3;? let me tell me why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merger was very complicated because one of the contributions had been made and simultaneously corrected to many places. another programmer had changed much text in the same file. the result were many conflicts when shooting.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program used by me was just the changed lines, but I could not see what exactly had changed within these lines. and there was no evidence regarding the places where perhaps, there was perhaps one of these changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">That was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could display differences within one line and changes to white characters. later, any quantity of more useful features were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">If you want to compare text fast text, copy it simply into the clipboard and add it in one of the comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function of work, was the same and merge of folders. this function was turned & diff3; almost into a full file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-way encoding is fully supported. this is useful if two persons can work independently from each other one piece of Kode and the modifications at the same time. in this Editor, you can even edit the result. in this editor, you can even edit the result. the screenshot shows three quotas files when assembling:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& low diff3; helps you complete the same and merge folder. this screenshot shows & kdiff3; in the folder merge:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; shows the exact differences and is based on the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you often have to check this function you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white characters and tabulators are visible. if lines are visible in a certain number of white characters, one can see at a glance at the summary in column at the left side. (no trouble more, if any one changes the influence.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is equal, and the others distinguishes itself in one row, then depicts the color which is different. red color means that both files are different.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files are in the same name, but in different folders, you can facilitate the tippment by using only the filenames of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Diff3 Folner1 folder and diffuse folder with diffuse 3 folder: diffuse 3 folder, folder 3 folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">The opening dialog box allows manual type filenames, select the selection via the file browser (file...) or the exit of a last modified file. if you need to specify a third file; if you have no third file, the analysis of the differences can be carried out with two files.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Via the button file... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the same or combination of folders will be selected, for B and C but a folder will then use & kdiff3; the filenames are used in both other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">When assembling, the input field is active for goal and can process itself. it is not necessarily necessary to set immediately an output file. you can do this step later when saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The setup button opens a dialog with Settings. you can set up options before you start with the same / merge.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you want to compare a text but only parts of a text. & low diff3; allows you to select text parts from clipboard into the active comparison window. compared to the opening dialog, you can simply select the dialog with the shutdown button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use drag and departure: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from a editor and let it fall over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">Which thought is behind it? sometimes contains a file e.g. several similar functions. if you want to figure out these functions, they would like to compare and compare these functions. now you can easily copy and compare the relevant sections.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently, you can't pull out any out of & diff3; only the case can be supported by text in a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the drag and lay text into another program as cut and insert (instead of copying and insert). in such a case, your original data might be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">In the upper part of each text window, the info line contains the characters A, B or C, the filename and the line number of the first visible row. (if the path comes to a file, let the mouse rest on the line. then a small relief window will show the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source windows are assigned to letters A, B and C. A has the color blue, B the color green and C is magical. (these settings can be changed over the settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">If a difference is detected, you can see the color which file is differentiated. if both files are differentiated. the color scheme is especially useful when you compare three files. this is well visible in the next section (merge).</seg>
<seg id="2306">Left next to the text is the summary column. if differences were found, the column displays the appropriate colour. with some programming languages, white characters is not so important to see the relevant changes only in character cassettes and comments, for the preprocessor and in few, more rarely relevant cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line, which separates the summary column of text, is interrupted by the digits, where the source file has no lines. if the line is enabled, the line is shown on broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The outcome window (below the comparison window) has also an Info line with the inscription edition:, the filename and [Gechanges] if you have done the result. usually, it contains the automatic compilation, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts have disbanded, the deposit is disabled!!! (use the buttons to next dissolved / unsolved conflict in order to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparative windows is used, any difference is to be replaced at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By one click with the left mouse button in one of the windows, the group is shown in all windows, where the first group is highlighted in the windows. this group is then highlighted in the beginning of the group. it will be highlighted the color background color for current section and on the left is a black beams.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes, by automatic interaction, or by manual edit any further line, no further line is left; it is not only a placeholder for the case that you may change your opinion and perhaps once again a different source. this text appears neither in the final file, nor in a mark which you might want to copy and somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; merge setbacks; however, in the clipboard, if you copy such a text from the spring window. go carefully with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: if the options are able to ignore the options listed below or Ignorers C / C + + comments, changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">This will navigate mainly with the images and mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you're in one of the window, you can use it in one of the window. if you can use it from other programs, Siw as you can also use other programs. in addition to the vertical frame bar, you can also click navigated to navigation.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the eye window, you can also use the other buttons to edit. using the insert button, you can switch between single feet and overdrive mode. (default is the set-up mode).</seg>
<seg id="2317">One click with the left mouse button in one of the summary columns synchronizes view of all windows at the beginning of the respective group (as already in the section and the editing output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons to navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / previous difference (Ctrl-down / Ctrl picture), to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-down / Strg-picture) or to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-down / Strg-picture). therefore, all non-dissolved conflicts continues to be regarded as a conflict. therefore, between solving and unsolved conflicts has to be distinguished.</seg>
<seg id="2319">In order to copy the marking into clipboard, you need to copy the copying button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl-Insert). if this option is enabled, it will automatically mark you into the clipboard. be careful with this option, because you could see the contents of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Zeiling are stored according to the underlying operating system. UNIX variants use a line curtain\\ r\. KDiff3 retains the ceiling of the source files, therefore you should use & kdiff3; also do not use binary files.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and the list of the files used are automatically saved and re-produced during the next start. (setting up menu &gt; KDiff3...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Choose a script with fixed width. (in some systems, the dialog provides fonts with variable width to choose, but you should not use it.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you activate this option, differences are displayed in short font. if the selected Scripture does not support this representation, nothing happens.</seg>
<seg id="2324">In systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors could not be available in its pure form, but would be infiltrated. in these systems, the button defaults automatically provides an unstable color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">If this option is enabled, the tabulator button is inserted the corresponding number of spaces. otherwise, a tabulator will be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">When entering or return, the insert on the previous line will automatically be used for the next row.</seg>
<seg id="2327">If this option is enabled, each selection will be copied automatically into the clipboard. manual copying into the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can choose which type-type type you prefer to store. the default value is the generally usual selection at the used operating system.</seg>
<seg id="2329">During the same time attempts & diffuse 3; first, all fully identical lines can be found in the source files. in this step, white characters can be ignored. in this step, white characters are not ignored. even when assembling, white characters are not ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) save a car jack '\' at the end of one line, but then you could save files with different sizes in side-side comparison, but if this option is activated, but like a white character will be disabled, but this option has to be deactivated. in default, this option is deactivated.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In default, this option is disabled. in the first part of the analysis are numbers and related characters ('0' - '9', '.', '-') ignore the differences, but they will be treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2332">In default, this option is disabled. changes in comments are covered as changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intensely after even smaller underdifferences. option is enabled in the default setting. it is effective in complicated and large files but slowly at very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In automatic further jump mode, this setting, how long will the result of the selection will be displayed, before the next post-sale conflict will continue.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Dissolves automatically every conflicts in white characters by selecting the chosen file as a source. if you need it only from time to time, then use the automatic selection of conflicts in numbers or comments, if the options ignore the numbers, or Ignorers C / C + + comments are activated.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are described in chapter for scanning of folders and execute a merge. look for details under documentation for the directory comparing and merge.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is stored and already an older version exists, then the original version is the Suffix .original file, if already such a backup file with the Suffix .original exists, this will be deleted without backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">The language of the user interface does not adapting the current program. you must finish & diffuse, so that the change is active. (this option is set in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is set up to the control centre globally.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following coefficients settings can be set separately for each entry. if you use this option, the following adjustment is used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">Over the selection fields for coding is a short note that the local coding is. (this can't be changed here and has for you pure informal character.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file coding for source files. this affects as special characters are treated and interpreting. as the coding for each file can be adjusted individually, even files with different coding can be compared and combined.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have a file, you can define which coding is to be used for storing.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define pre-processing command, they could not be able to work with your codec. (e.g., your files can't work 16-bit ASCII.) Using this option, you can define the coding of the output command line.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Switch this, to suppress the modifications of changes in white characters in text or oversight. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments when the options ignore the numbers or Ignorers C / C + + comments.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available if you compare three files. however, the differences between two of three files are displayed. however, you may only want to see the differences between two of three files. according to the selection of A & lt; C, A & lt; C, C or B & lt; C is indicated in addition to the normal a second overlay column with the required information.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you would like to use the available square on the screen for long lines. simply use the less important window. (this option is located in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">The comparison window unks each other or over each other. this can also be useful for ads of long lines. (this option is located in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you consider the differences and then choose the files to compile the files. current file will continue to compare the file names and use the filenames of the last source file as an voiced name for the output file, then the name of the last used output file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">At the reading of a file it will pass first to this external command. in & kdiff3, the output of the command is visible, and not the file itself. you can use your own preprocessor that corresponds to your own requirements. you can use this function for example to cut or correct parts or correct.</seg>
<seg id="2350">At the reading of a file it is given first to this external command. if also a normal preprocessing command was used (see above), then the output of command is used only in line spacing. you can write your own preprocessor that corresponds to your own requirements. each input line needs to have a corresponding output line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind it is to enable the user more flexibility when inserting the diff results. however, most users would like to program, and most users would like to program the good news, that in most cases SED or Perl is completely sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this preprocessing command for line tributary directly to the input in large letters: SED's /\\ (. *\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other versioning systems use some key words (info: / cvs /\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While she experimenting with SED, you may be able to understand and perhaps do you like this regular expressions even. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">The noignores of numbers is actually a built-in function in KDiff3. but it's good as an example of a further processing command for line tributs. SED's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Each character between' and ']' is a hits, and any hits will be replaced by nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you would like to perform several goals at once. then you can use the Semikolon ';', in order to split the goals of one another. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead SED you can also use anything other such as Perl. Perl -p -e's / REGEXP / replacement / switches' allerdings are needed at Perl. where SED\\ (and\\) are needed, Perl needs only (and) without the set '\\'. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data according to the normal preprocessor are retained for the ad and to build. further operations change only the data that the line spacing like-Algorythmus.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases when you use a normal pre-processing unit, the line of the microprocessor looks like input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The preprocessor commands are very useful, but as in any function, the text changes or differences, you can't notice certain differences and destroy significant data in the worst case.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often, programmer must process many files in a folder. for this reason, you can compare and assemble complete folders with & diff3; complete folder.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... for any object a suggestion: you can adapt the suggestion before the start,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate the simulated changes to simulated the simulated changes, without interrupting them,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... leads selected actions either with all (F7 key) or only with selected objects (F6-key).</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is similar to the same and merge of individual files very similar. you must open a folder on the command line or in a dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">If three folders are merged, folder will be used as a basis. if no target folder is indicated, uses & diff3; folder 3 as a target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders will start automatically, not the merging of folders, select the menu entry or press the F7 key. (further details follow.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">During the reading of the folder you will be informed of a small news window over current progress. if you cancel the folder, only the files are listed, which were compared to then.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When scanning of the folder is completed, shows & kdiff3; a list window with results on the left side,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Any file and every folder that was found during the scan is displayed here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder tincture is normally folded. you can double click on the + / - click on the + / - click on the + / - click on the + / - click on the button or show all subdirectories with which you can open all the folder.</seg>
<seg id="2372">If you double-click on a file, the file is started and it appears a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The symbol in column name reflects the file type in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in different folders, this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detailed windows to the selected object. in such case, the clumps action cannot be selected automatically. if the merging set is started, you will be informed about problems of this kind.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As in the above picture you can see in the columns A / B / C the colors red, green, yellow and black.</seg>
<seg id="2376">In identical entries, the color is also identical, even if the age of the entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered as identical if its entire content is identical. then, folder the same color. in folders, the age is not considerable for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea to this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colors reflect the colors of a sheet back, which is only green, then yellow and later when it is old, red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C identical, but not B: copy B (or if B) does not exist, delete the target, if it exists)</seg>

<seg id="2385">... A and B exist, but not identical: assemble and save the result in both folders. (the user looks as the visible file names for the output file only B; directly after assembling, copied & diff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">If two folders will be merged and select the option of new file instead of merge (unsafe), but the date of files are different, but the date is identical. if such errors are not removed, the folders cannot be launched.</seg>
<seg id="2387">During the collision, a file is done after the other hand. if the collision was successful, and according to other reports, if something unexpected occurs, you should take a last review and see whether the status is everywhere in order.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If in the installation dialog box is selected to view the file's comparative analysis, KDiffusion is deleted, is dissolved, non-white and white conflicts. (the column for solving conflicts is displayed only if three folders are compared to or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either set the selected entry (file or Odner), or all entries at once. if you have selected all collation actions (also in all subfolders), you can start the collision.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you have no target folder, then the Three-file-merge mode C is used as the objective, when two folders will lead B as a goal and when synchronize, A and / or B is used as a target.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you select a target folder, please check whether all entries must be displayed in the target folder. there are some options to be skipped with specific entries. check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To start all entries: select the directory together / continue in the directory menu or press F7 (keynote). in order to move the current entry, select the current element to run or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If by contradictory file types still exist, a message appears that shows the faulty elements, you can choose to select a valid promotion.</seg>
<seg id="2394">If you merge all entries, a dialog window appears with the options, simulate and break down.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Select Simulate if you would like to see what would happen if you really want to change without the really changes. you will get a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& diff3; then led certain actions with all entries. if a manual procedure is necessary (summarizing a single file), then a merge window will open (note the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">If you are finished with a file, select the directory together / continue or press F7. if you have not saved again, a corresponding dialog appears. then leads & kdiff3; his work will continue with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If & kdiff3; on a mistake, a message appears and detailed status information. at the end of the list, you will be able to try out the cause of the problem. if you have the option to select the problem of the problem or to solve the problem in any way before you proceed to the problem.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries are summarized individually, please note & diff3; these entries (in the current session) and leads them not again in later. even if the interact has been carried out or not saved, these entries will be stored as done. only if you change the merge action, these entries will be merged again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & kdiff3; (menu settings - &gt; KDiffusion...) now has a section called directory merging with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that are displayed on the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree. separate placeholder: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). the default is *. folder must not correspond to this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be used as a sample, use the semicolon; as a separator. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. default is * .original; * .O.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be used as a sample, use the semicolon; as a separator. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. default is * .original; * .O.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignore files that are also ignored by CVS. many autonomous files are ignored by CVS. the great advantage is that this folder can be set with a .cvsignore file. (check below info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file systems you have a default attribute. in other file systems this option lets you decide whether these files are displayed in the element tree or not. this option is switched on in default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">Links to files: if the option is switched off, symbolic corrections are compared. if the option is enabled, the files are compared to the links. this is deactivated in default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">If the option is switched on: if the option is switched off, the links are switched on. if the option is switched on, the links such as normal folders will lead and recursively reviews. (note: if the option is switched on, the links would lead to a link.) This option is shut down on a link.) This option is shut down in default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The full analysis of each file carries out the statistic columns. (the number of dissolved, non-white and white conflicts.) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and much slower, if they are applied to files that does not contain text. (specify an appropriate anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare big folders through a slow network, it may be faster, only the date of change and file size. however, this speed advantage will cost you to be careful. please check this option is in default.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to confidentiality of date. there is no real comparison instead. the files are considered as identical if it is equal to, for example, if copying the change date. please use with caution. this option is retrieved in default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activating the synchronizing mode if two folders are compared to and no target folder. in this mode, the proposals will be identical to both folders. also the results of the files are stored in both folders. this option is shut down in default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, the copy of the newer file is suggested as action. (this will be considered insecure, because it is not changed that other file would not be changed.) This option is shut down in any case.) This option is shut down.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or file is replaced by another file, then the original version will be renamed and will receive the extension .original If an old backup file is already deleted, this will not only be able to run the entire folder. this option is switched on full folders. this option is switched on in default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally the folders remains visible to the merge of individual files; you can switch the window part with the mouse. if you like this, you can switch the window window in the window menu and switch between the two views between the two views.</seg>
<seg id="2415">Probably, you prefer to compare a file via double-click. however, you can also install a single file without loosing the folder. if you use the file, the status will be done automatically and the file will not be merged again when you run the folder.</seg>
<seg id="2416">However, this status is lost, if you read the list here: directory -menu: new reading</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparent with the help of KIO slaves. KDiff3 uses this to read files and folders. in this way you can specify files and folders to open, which are on local or remote computers.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with one on a FTP server. the second command line compares a folder inside a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has another syntax than local files and folders. a few things you should note:</seg>

<seg id="2481">& kmag; is a very powerful application that is constantly expanded by new functions. it is optimized for use on performance weak computers.</seg>
<seg id="2482">If you are & kmag, a window appears as shown above. the main window of screen. in the following will be displayed as a magnification window. the image, which is displayed in the magnification window, is called an enlarged area of screen and is called below the selection window.</seg>
<seg id="2483">In the standard settings are increased & kmag; the area around the mouse indicator as a mobile magnifying glass. alternatively, you can display & kmag; for a selected screen range in the magnification window (selection mode) or the environment of the mouse button on the screen (eg; on the left screen).</seg>
<seg id="2484">If you want to avoid the mouse indicator in the enlarged window, select the mouse button, select the mouse button. please note that the mouse is not able to detect the form of the mouse. this is always the default KDE; / Qt.</seg>

<seg id="2497">& kmousetool; emulates a mouse click on the same spot as soon as the mouse has been running on the same spot. it is thought to help people who suffer from RSI syndrome (repetitive strain relief syndrome) and which each mouse click pain.</seg>
<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulates a mouse click on the same spot as soon as the mouse switch on the same spot. it is intended to help people who emulate a mouse click on the replica of the mouse. it also requires a little exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& mousousetool; can handle the pain that occurs in order to use the mouse, and helps so many people to assemble the computer without pain. unfortunately, do not suffer pain that have been merged with the use of your computer, if this is not yet done.</seg>
<seg id="2500">In order to make it even more clear: even if & kmousetool should be avoided by clicking on the mouse, it is necessary to prevent pain that applies through the mouse because of the mouse is, useless. and as with all ergonomic support, the result can fall for each other.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse moving and leads a mouse click, as soon as you break the movement briefly.</seg>
<seg id="2502">If the smart transfer is activated, makes & kmousetool; a break after the pressing of the mouse is emulated. you can now move it until the end of the mouse. the smart transfer requires a little exercise, but you get it quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">At the end of the mouse movement, before the end of the mouse movement, before & kmousetool; a mouse click brings out.</seg>
<seg id="2504">If you are switched on, the rotation speed is switched on (1 / 10 s). this is set the time limit, the & kmousetool; after shutdown the mouse button is waiting before it takes off the mouse button if there is no maintainer due to the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2505">& kmousetool; now support the click to right and back, followed by a break, followed by a break. this moves are saved in the file $KDEHOME / share / kmousetool _ estkes.txt. the first time is started, but they can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">When the sound is delayed, you can move & KDE, to move the response time. open the & kcontrolcenter;, go to sound & multimedia, choose a sound system and here the rider. there is a slider sound buffer that allows you to reduce the response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting is marked, & kmousetool is launched; at each start of & KDE, this function is currently only under & KDE; available. at GNOME or other window environments please click the corresponding documentation to find out how you start a program automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Sets all settings on the values back when opening the dialog. have already pressed the button on the user, the settings will be reset to the user after the last pressing of the user.</seg>
<seg id="2509">Best use & kmousetool; initially with default settings. in particular the smart slide should be switched off at first. if you want to click on the automatic mouse, you can leave the smart transfer later.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it is necessary to reduce the response times of & KDE, if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2511">At first, you should make a mouse click without effect: clicking on the neutral components of windows or on positions within the browser window that does not display any link, does not run the mouse on such places until you want to use it again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">If your mouse is printed, you should clean your mouse. this is normally rather simple. the trick is that you don't just clean the mouse balls, but also the rolls that are in contact with the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First you need to remove the mouse ball. as it happens, is from mouse to mouse, but it should be clear when you can view the bottom of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you should have to see the reels. these are in the sides of the Locking, which the ball was used. the Dreck and the soiling, you can easily scratching the ball.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations, the operating system has started the version of & kmousetool; if you're using this case, it means that & kmousetool, this means that & kmousetool is not able to terminate the operation no more through the batch of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens if you are & kmousetool; using a different window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem exists that you can run a mouse click. here, the status of & kmousetool; reset and you can work as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, tries & kmousetool; continue to perform mouse clicks and sets the cursor to a different place.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor there. however, you do not want to bring the mouse on a neutral area of the workspace, if you want to bring back the mouse on a neutral area. safe zones for the mouse, you can do the gray surfaces around the tool bar and menus and cover lines of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with intelligent shift, but I do not create it to edit text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The intelligent shift is a advanced function of & kmousetool; and it takes its time before you want to move it into the clipboard. if you want to move it back to any other action. but it will probably be able to prepare any problems for them. here are some advice to them:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Don't use the smart slide if you just start to use & kmousetool; click on a mouse click on a mouse click on the end of the text box, while you move the mouse button to the other end of the text and reuse the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible click. therefore, if & kmousetool; the mouse button is played. so, you can use the sound like a mouse click. later, you can use the smart transfer without the audible mouse click. but it requires some exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To use & kmousetool; you can use the Xtest extension for & X Window; installed on the most system already.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible clicks is only available when the system has a sound card and speakers, and are set up correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; operated the mouse button as soon as the mouse has been running short. this program was developed for people who suffer from RSI Syndrome and to whom the firm has been prepared for pain.</seg>

<seg id="2723">Currently & ktts; SSML only partially and only in basic functions. the following restrictions are available:</seg>
<seg id="2724">You need to install the Rab _ diphone voice (British male), since this is the standard one that uses the festival of SSML.</seg>

<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the normal propositional filter filter is automatically set up when you start the tsmgr for the first time. it cannot be removed only. do not change anything on this filter, unless you do what you do.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Amendment of boundary filters compare text with a regular expression for propositional sign (decimalcode 8) to the propositional sign (decimal number 8) in front of the filtering automatically from the text. note that the standard movement filters will retain the character sequences.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filter never be applied to & KDE; -News (crayfy), warnings, messages or the output of Screen Readern.</seg>

<seg id="2839">This section may not replace more information about IP networks. in this appendix, only basic information about the integration of the PC in a small (home use) network.</seg>
<seg id="2840">Currently, IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv5 has never expected big spread. this description focuses on the widespread IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is the knowledge to assign IP address of a network interface. in strange networks, am & eg; workplace is the network administrator can be used or if available, DHCP can not be selected, if the IP address can be easily selected!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When using a private small (home) network, the IP address is provided for this purpose, to avoid IP address flickering with the global (internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not relayed on the internet, therefore it is any use.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the Internet for such machines can be made by setting a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, usually used addresses in the range from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254. the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask is usually set on 255.255.255.0, so that all the computers are in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the second the loopback address (localhost = the own computer). the default route is required for the IP resline.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The Internet address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in local own machine. usually, the address 127.0.0.1 is an own so-called loopback interface which works like a closed circle.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& dat; is a security program for tape on the basis of tar. it also offers the opportunity to create multiple archives on a band. the second goal was to answer a question that my wife introduced: how much longer lasts, if you are secures?</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a band can be used, it must be bound by & dat; it can be done on three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& dat; do the band back and read the prestressing of the bandes. recognizes & dat; the spell on the band will not be asked if the band should be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Recognize & dat; the advance, looking for the matching index on your disk. can't be found, you will be asked if the Bandindex is to be created.</seg>
<seg id="2897">Everything is smooth, changing the symbol for the tape drive, to show that the band was bound. in the status bar a corresponding message appears. the content of the tape can now be searched for the tape.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before the throwing of the belt, initially the integration must first be solved. there are three methods to apply this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& dat; gives a change of symbol to the band that the integration for the band was solved and shows an appropriate message in the status bar. the band can now be cast without any danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a band of & dat; may be used, it must be formatted by & dat;</seg>
<seg id="2901">A band types must be formatted before using data. this process does not correspond to the storage of data. this procedure must not be formatted before using the band by & dat; the floppy disk drives cannot be formatted. floppy disk drives do not require a formatting of the band, DAT drives on the other hand.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the band called and the capacity, the band will continue. all data on the band are lost! after completion of the process, the band will automatically be mounted, and is ready to use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you ascending the backup process, you must select the required files. this can be done on three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in local file tree. only this file or folder will be secured.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Mark a backup profile in the tree. only the files specified in the profile shall be secured.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Mark files in local file tree with a skins. only the selected files and / or sub-folders are secured.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Click with the right mouse button on the local file tree and choose from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup was initiated, the dialog opens up for backup. in this dialogue you can test the selected files and change the settings for backup.</seg>
<seg id="2909">If you have confirmed the settings, the dialog box backup. the dialog shows the progress of the backup process including the data rate and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Select a file or folder in one of the Archive for the drive. it is checked for the selected file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Mark the files in one of the archives created in one of the archives. only the selected files and / or subfolder will be tested.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Click with the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu entry....</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the test procedure was started, the dialog for Settings appears. in this dialogue you can check your selection and check the work file for checking.</seg>
<seg id="2914">If you confirm the settings for checking, the dialog appears. this dialog shows the progress of the test process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before you can manage the reproduce, the files must be recovered. this can be done on two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives which belong to the entry for the tape drive. only the selected file or subfolder will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Mark the desired files from one of the archives with a Häkchen. only the selected files and / or subfolder will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2918">With the right mouse button on a file or folder in one of the archives and choose from the menu...</seg>
<seg id="2919">Once the restore process was started, the dialog for recovery. in this dialog you can check your selection and check the working folder for restoration.</seg>
<seg id="2920">If you have confirmed the settings for restoration, the dialog appears. this dialog shows the progress of recovery process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it is necessary to create the indexural file using the band's indexes. this process deletes all existing index files for this band. you can rebuild the index on two types of tape:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This is provided by a backup profile with the just selected files and the default settings. you can use the following settings for a backup profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current working folder where the backup should be made. the list of securing files will be updated automatically according to the specified work folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all folders that are listed under backup files, that only the files are stored on the same file, such as the folder. file, which are on other file systems, you can add separately under backup files. each entry is considered by tar regardless of the others.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Perform an incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is secured. only the files have been backed since then.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file which is used to determine changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Deletes the snapshot file before the call of tar. this causes that all files are backed up and a new snapshot file is laid for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of knobs files & gt; and lt; lt; files was not completely implemented at the time of compilation of this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">The settings can set you over the menu item KDat... in the menu settings. the following settings can be displayed:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The complete path to device file for the belt drive (normally / dev / Tape). this path has to refer to the non-rewinding option of the belt.</seg>
<seg id="2931">This setting is active, transmitted & dat; before the band is bound to the command. at some drives it is necessary to be performed before reading and write operations.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is switched on, tried & dat; the expel to lock the tape. maybe this setting is not working with all banding drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is switched on, when loosening the integration of & dat; automatically put the tape. use this option not at Floppy Streamers.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is switched on, try & dat; the hardware-line blocksize for the tape drive. no matter whether this adjustment is active or not, you must have & dat; in any case the block size for your tape drive.</seg>
<seg id="2935">When & dat; a band formatted, it writes a file at the beginning of the band. this file should only show a memory block on the tape. the contents of the file is composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n °) The band-ID. the format of this character sequence is computer name: second, whereby computer name of the system is formatted on which the band is formatted. seconds is passed since the epoch in which the band has been formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $HOME / .kdat /.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The remaining files on the band are pure tar-archives created directly with & GNU / - tar. even other tar versions should work as long as it is not related to incremental fuses.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Check the contents of a backup association. this symbol is only active if a band is mounted.</seg>
<seg id="2940">& kslog log; is a & KDE. the program is suitable for inexperienced users where you can claim information about your system or where the system is stored on your system, or where the system offers the various protocol files. furthermore it enables users access to quick access to information about problems that occur on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksandlog; helps users to understand what your computer makes in the background. the program is suitable for experienced users who can't know where you can access information about your system or where the system is stored on the various protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, the system loglog; experienced users to enable quick access to information about problems that occur on their server. & ksystem log; try to provide some advanced functions, filtered and evaluated the protocol files of certain programs and evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 & ksellers log; a number of useful features include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of the Syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other features are also included in addition to the other chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you can see in the following screen photo, displays & ksellers log; functions can be easily filtering and sort the individual protocol lines of a protocol file easily and sort. the individual possibilities to sorting and filters will be shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After launching, & kslog log; initially the most important protocol file of the system - the system protocol allows you to open a small news window, and it will be open under Linux in the file / var / log, for the normal user normally does not have permission to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filtering the filter bar according to the selected filter button. in the default setting, the selection box contains the entry list. in the default setting, the selection box contains only displayed, if in one of the columns the string of the filter search is included.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can also select one other entry in this place. select the string process in the protocol process, and enter in addition to the entries in the filter Toolbar the name of a process, which shows you & ksystem log; all protocol lines, which were transmitted or created from this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to detect the important protocol lines. protocol lines of level mistakes are displayed with a conspicuous color than Protocol lines of level notice. the color representation of protocol lines can be shut-off.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to display only certain process (e.g. in the system protocol or in the cron Protocol), so you can examine the process identification (PID) in the column process. this may be useful for example, if you would like to examine the issuance of the Samba server. in this case, use filter bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">Furthermore, you can activate the option to the new lines in the context menu of the main window to display all new protocol lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& kslog log; allows display of several protocol files in separate subwindows. to open this function, use the entries in the window window to open and manage. once you select a sub-window, select the menu to display a protocol.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& kslog log; has a dedicated website to http: / / ksystem log.forum-software.org. dort you find further information about the supply of & kslog log.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& kslog log; find also in the following folder of & KDE; -Subversion Archive: ksburg log; in & KDE; -Archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & KDE; System V Init Editor, rather known (and in the following also called) as & ksysv; this section leads a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv;</seg>
<seg id="2957">The system V Init is quickly evolving to control the program starts when updrive the system into the & Linux; world. therefore, because it is easier to use, more powerful and more flexible than the traditional BSD intit.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go further to historical aspects (e.g. because I know nothing else: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The init binaries is under / sam and not under / etc. this is therefore important because someone could try to set a machine on System V Init without a reinstall and new format. therefore, you need to make sure the old Init was removed from there if there was there one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init differs from the BSD Init that the configuration files in a sub-folders of / etc are instead directly into / etc. this folder is called rc.sysinit and the following further folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a whole amount of scripts. basically you need to start a script for any system service, which do not need such things such as network, NFS, & shipmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not include such things such as offset serial that is only launched. such calls belong to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should lie down below / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even if it does not have any use of it. you can also run a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to run a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to run something with the serial port.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel is looking for different places after the program init and starts the first to find it.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default Runlevel is registered in / etc / inittab. you should see the following line as the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point you can cast a look at the second column and probably determine that the default Running 3 can be carried out. if you want to change anything, then you can fix it, then you will repair the system by restart the system and execute the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start all the correct scripts? if you enter -l enter in rc3.d, then you will see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no right files in this folder. instead, each entry is here a link to one of the scripts in the directory init.d.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How to start and stops init actually system services? simply: each of the script is so written that it actually accepts a argument like start and stop. you can actually start this script by hand on the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would hold the httpd server. init reads the name, and if the one contains a K, the script will be accessed by the argument. if it includes a S, the script will start with the argument.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people wish to create a simple way to create machines for many purposes. I could run & eg; a server running level, which can run only httpd, & shows;, network & etc. also, I could have a user-running, the & eg; & kdm;, network & etc.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you can learn the use of & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointer is simple to say trivial: simply drag an entry in the area of availability system services to one of the six running level to start it on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can shift scripts between Runleveling or modify the position within a level by taking it somewhere else. in this way, the entry is found out of its original Running (or his position). this happens only if they go an entry out of the price of the availability.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries will be postponed if you want to select this in a new area. in order to select only on a new Running menu, and then insert it in the target range -- even then, if the same entry exists in the target range of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of a entry can be sometimes not calculated. in such a case you need to edit the sorting numbers in the environments before you can try to insert the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: currently there are no possibility to restore entries that have been thrown into the paper basket. be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the Tabulator button to activate the various workareas (available system services, Running 1 Start, Running 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection of upper or below the previous.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move into another running level, push it with cut into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it to the desired Runlevel with insert (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the sorting number or the name of a entry manually, press the button key to change the tab button. connect the dialog button to accept the changes in order to accept the changes, or press Esc to reject the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of data loss require all entries in the menu file a confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. defaults to the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc), if it is available. otherwise they are stored by & ksysv; changes to default settings are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I tried to experiment with the standard Runleveling and now starts the machine resistant. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">In lilo -Prompt linux single and press the input button to start in single-use mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the standard running level to a reasonable value (3 should normally be in order).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have some system services with & ksysv; for version under Running X, but they are not performed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you use & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), you must process additional files in / etc, which are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of the distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way, such as system services started in these distributions, the configuration for proprietary inserting programmes of this distributions is equal, but unfortunately no standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using another distribution: check whether all configuration files are available, which are required by the respective system service (and also if they are in the right directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache or httpd) just terminate when your configuration files are not available or false.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The meaning of the & Linux; Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you use a different distribution, please send me information about Running, that this manual can be added.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation is based on & user; 1.0. with this program you can manage the user and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & user; it's enough to read the chapter adaptation of & user;</seg>
<seg id="2991">Once you have made changes, you have to save this. either use the corresponding symbol of the toolbar or entry to the entry in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& user; is an easy application. the main window consists of two cartography cards, the user and the use of troops. to edit the desired user or the desired group with a double click on the entry. it appears the dialog or group properties.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some cards are only displayed if you have extended system settings. only if you have advanced system settings, if you are able to set individual settings, if shadow passwords appear if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd installed in BSD uniforms.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The board card password will appear if shadow passwords or such as / etc / master.passwd installed in BSD -Unix.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This map card appears only if required for at least one hour's file system (Quota) is enabled and initialize (recognizable at the file quota / quota group on the file system). here you can change parameters in each user, depending on the file size:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be adjusted individually for each file system. the current file system is selected by means of the field file system</seg>
<seg id="2997">The map map groups informs about the selected user of the selected user. the standard group, to which the user belongs, can be found in the primary group. furthermore, the user can mark in other groups by increasing these in the large field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The Group's dialog features a list of all users. to add a user to the group, mark this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or a group, add from the menu users or group or click the matching button in the toolbar button. the editing or deletion of the selected user or the selected group will be analogue.</seg>
<seg id="3000">Using this module, you can add the lilo boat manager, remove and change the time to boats of the standard operating system, remove the standard operation system, remove, change operating systems, change and more.</seg>
