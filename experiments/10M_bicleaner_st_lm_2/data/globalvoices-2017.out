although I visited the USA since 2012 at least once a year , I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love to America is exceptionally great .
as many of my generation I grew up with American movies , American writers will be read and operated by American music .
in fact , this country had a great pro@@ found effect on me that I was mainly based on an American film journalist .
when the 14 @-@ year @-@ old I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gray Gran@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , a fear@@ less Rep@@ orter , who raised his interest in the Supreme Court with judges who wanted to occup@@ y his interest .
I was caught .
&quot; &quot; &quot; free after Method Man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was if that is the absolute truth , forget all others that I would like to do with my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the year that I lived in Arizona , had only intensi@@ fied my ad@@ mir@@ ation for the USA .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; America is the only country where I ever lived , whose diversity is so inv@@ iting , that you are always that you are , and it is easy to accept in a community of equal human beings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I had even written a very plain Liebes@@ brief about his size .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much has been written about the x@@ en@@ op@@ ho@@ bia and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his asc@@ ension is for me , as he goes with its commitment .
he never stops away with his mind behind the mountain , as you say so beautiful .
he says exactly what he th@@ inks , like a former colleague it express , and publicly declared his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro@@ American and Women .
nevertheless , people had to re@@ acts on his statements and agreed in Sch@@ ars for him .
the 13 million votes which he won in the Republi@@ can elections , was the highest number that had been nominated by the party .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans that supported this big@@ uous person , asked me ?
I could not know Tr@@ ump and his voters in line with people who I learned during my time in Phoenix .
as for example my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism program , which takes people from around the world , a deep faith man , with whom I could hold me about Islam and his past .
also voted by Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the present editor of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati Inqu@@ ir@@ er , who is the present editor of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati Inqu@@ ir@@ er . &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to watch the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game .
tr@@ umps In@@ toler@@ ance is also in contrast to the gener@@ osity of movement that I strug@@ gling with Sandy B@@ ahr , who fighting her life for the environment , and her husband Dave , my family , who treated me like their son .
even it fits to the engagement of Krist@@ i K@@ app@@ es , who always helped me with patience and wor@@ m@@ wood , and helped my colleagues to get us to the complexity of the American life .
then there were Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors who helped me a lot of my career .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these people and those characterized by them per@@ ished my love to America . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while Tr@@ ump on his way to the nominated republi@@ can presidential data , they give me a stop and the counter@@ part of his limited vision of America .
however , it turned out that they were the exception of rule .
on 8 November 2016 there were over 50 million Americans , mostly white , the presidency of a man , despite - or perhaps because of his cont@@ emp@@ t against non @-@ white people .
the con@@ front@@ ation with the idea that people voted for Tr@@ ump , because they were either distributed to his rac@@ ism and fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism , because they were ready to over@@ see these things , broke out almost the heart .
perhaps it is un@@ fair to describe Tr@@ ump @-@ voters as the b@@ assist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people said , one of my friends , is exactly what has led us to this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is super@@ ficial and respec@@ t@@ less and indicates an in@@ ability to understand those who act on a different way and think .
it shows the people that their wor@@ ries and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their congregations will not be taken into account .
could it be that these voters have voted for Tr@@ ump , because they would like to re@@ win the control of a country , which they have disappointed ?
in other words , they perhaps wanted to say that they are still important in this America ?
perhaps too .
however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ n@@ ick , who comm@@ enting the cruel decision to collect a man who looks down with cont@@ emp@@ t on those who look different than he .
this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( An@@ m . ) . : as much as &quot; re@@ jection of the White against all other eth@@ nic@@ ities , &quot; The Word of white in An@@ gle on the White and wh@@ i@@ pl@@ ash , which means as much as the big Van Jones called , has exactly what did America did so great .
millions of people around the world estimate the American Ideal - no matter whether myth or reality , it is still a powerful idea - what faith or background you always like , America is called every welcome .
because this country chose his president twice the son of a Ken@@ y@@ an@@ ers whose history as he himself says , no@@ where else in the world would be possible .
with the election of Donald Tr@@ umps , there is a huge part of white America &apos;s promise and says : to Hell with versat@@ ility , religious freedom and the whole term of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in the America after 9 / 11 the white man is again at the Ru@@ der , say .
at all this I think at K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
at a rally for Hill@@ ary Clinton Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , my son , Captain Hum@@ ay@@ un K@@ ahn , had a place in your Americas ? &quot; he asked Mr. Khan .
the multitude answered with a loud &quot; No ! &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your United States ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; ro@@ ar the amount .
&quot; have Lat@@ inos a square in your Americas ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
have A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American has a place in your Americas ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they called them and their voices were killed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if someone , who is not so as you , have a place in your Americas ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he received a single and loud &quot; NE@@ IN &quot; !
Mr. Khan ended with the words : &quot; God is thanks , Mr. Tr@@ ump , isn &apos;t that your Americas . &quot; 36 hours later he has been corrected .
the country , for which his son was fallen , sent him a message .
this is now Tr@@ umps Land , told the message .
and all the people that look like Mr. Khan , could not find no place in this new United States .
and this is my heart .

what has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero congregation in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca , with the children of the par@@ agu@@ a@@ ic city of Cat@@ e@@ ura together ?
that the music played on both places , not only the life of the children has changed , but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with the waste
Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a great gar@@ bage dump , only 16 Kilometers south from O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial city , which is very popular among tourists , but worlds far from nearby pre@@ heated ruins and its world famous cuisine .
for some years now the La B@@ anda de M@@ Ãº@@ sica ( Music ban@@ de ) is now playing in the municipality : one of the children and an adult symph@@ ony orchestra , which has found a possibility of over@@ coming the surrounding poverty .
a music school with 100 students is become a central interest for the municipality of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the church , which is located in one of the p@@ oo@@ rest provinces of Mexico , is known for her drugs , abuse , and the gangs violence .
however , this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot , who started a musical project and the youth offered a rare hope .
the young band members take their obligations towards the music group very serious , the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI :
once they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch , they run through the dust roads to reflect their great passion .
they are always busy and playing with shining eyes and play in the bust@@ ling day for day trumpet , tromb@@ one , Pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , forest horn , Pau@@ ke , Bon@@ g@@ os and the Con@@ ga .
music from the gar@@ bage
more than 7.000 kilometres south of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero play the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura - a village , that is practically on the largest gar@@ bage dump of As@@ unci@@ on in the capital city - on instruments which are made of restored waste material :
music with restored instruments , which consist of local firm waste materials , made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ e@@ ura where the Recycl@@ er under management of F@@ avi@@ o ChÃ¡vez started to trans@@ form parts of the case in instruments .
the instruments im@@ itate violin , viola , c@@ elli , double @-@ b@@ asses , gu@@ itars , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trumpets , tromb@@ ones and percussion instruments .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ische and Latin American music and music of the Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra , etc .
in an article the Los Angeles Times F@@ avi@@ o ChÃ¡vez is remin@@ is@@ cent of a local eco @-@ biolog@@ ist and musician teacher of the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura , at the beginning time :
first it was very difficult because we had no room for rehear@@ s@@ als and we had to teach the parents in the gar@@ bage . the children knew not music and it was very difficult to contact parents , because many of them do not live with their children .
this changed when F@@ avi@@ o was shown something that he had never seen before : a violin made from waste .
today , there is a complete orchestra that plays for instruments made of recovered material and is called the Recycl@@ ed Orchestra .
a documentation of &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic gar@@ bage dump ) shows the musical achievement :
the world generates about one billion tons of rub@@ b@@ ish each year .
those who live with him and of him are the off@@ ence - like people in Cat@@ e@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they walk in something beauti@@ es .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspir@@ ing spectac@@ le of gar@@ bage @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra played his music even before Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team work successfully fight illeg@@ ally f@@ isheries
photo Â© F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that combat wild illegal f@@ isheries .
this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine published by international , practi@@ ced solutions for environmental problems .
the re @-@ release is happening within a agreement with Global Vo@@ ices on the common use of content .
in West Africa , it was known that this ship had already run illeg@@ itim@@ ate fishing waters before it had sought out the other coast of Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the East African countries were brought to this way , and some inclined , a lawyer of this species to be called on their coasts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the compres@@ sors , Mozambique and the Seychelles mobil@@ ized quickly against the ship . they refused to condemn one of their har@@ bours and refused to give him a fishing permit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prime minister was surrounded by countries that you simply refused , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a leading employee of the Ken@@ yan fishing authority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is part of a team that discovered the ship &apos;s time and followed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 , the ship was driven out of the waters of the region : it was not succeeded to catch the fish .
in the end , there was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia , due to pill@@ aging the fish stocks .
the core of this initiative , the criminal practices and resources , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the N@@ RO Stop illegal F@@ ishing ( Il@@ legal fishing ) .
the members of this network are in addition to Somalia and Madagascar on six countries that had been displac@@ ed from their waters at that time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are equivalent and work together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts Project En@@ ding illeg@@ ally illegal . this project offers F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal f@@ isheries is un@@ regulated by the definition : what is cap@@ tiv@@ ated , is hidden because it is extremely difficult to replace it . thus , Il@@ legal F@@ isheries is a main cause of over@@ fishing by regions .
by the clear confusion of existing laws , by which certain hab@@ itats and species are to be protected , the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems , which have a delicate balance .
however , during the actions against illegal f@@ isheries , by bureau@@ cr@@ atic hur@@ dle with the information between individual countries , these actions took place in real time , with tra@@ ce@@ able on F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communications platform .
there you can exchange the individual countries together for example lists of exist@@ ent licenses , news to be suspected activities or details that you had experienced or experienced during a do@@ cking inspection .
fish @-@ i persecuted the activities of ships also very atten@@ tive if these are moving along the open sea , using satellite data .
this allows to mark the authorities to mark ships , which seem to fish in prohibited areas - about such that a ship invites you to fish caught on other ships .
ideally , such investigations may show whether the ships have a fishing licence , where they were on the road and possibly even if they have a criminal .
countries that are opposed to illegal fish catch , can be refused on the basis of such ships in their har@@ bours , which means that the ships could not be used to sell their cargo . and that they could even be comp@@ elled to the numbers of pen@@ alties , as in the case of the Premier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then there is considerable financial losses for the owners , which means the illegal fish catch is fin@@ anci@@ ally worthwhile . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that &apos;s what we want to achieve , &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , Chief director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a Ber@@ ater@@ ina , supporting the fight against illegal f@@ isheries in Africa and also F@@ ISH @-@ i also supported .
a closed front
the already mentioned platform was created to win over 20 million USD in lost sales , who lose eight members of the network H@@ ISH @-@ i every year due to illegal fishermen , penet@@ rate in East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive t@@ una fish shops , essential for the region &apos;s commercial fish from around the world . also these illegal fishermen use it .
these practices include actions like the sailing under false flag , counter@@ f@@ ake license documents , indication of ph@@ as@@ ien@@ amen , fishing protected species and fish areas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; simply use the missing international cooperation and make the weak@@ nesses of a non @-@ neutral control system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could not let a ship illeg@@ ally fishing and a land could say &apos; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You must not let my harbour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but another country could say &apos; Com@@ m to me &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and precisely this leg@@ ale hat@@ ch is trying to close F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so far the closed front works .
since its inc@@ eption F@@ ISH @-@ i was involved in more than 30 studies .
it was criminal networks uncovered , the counter@@ f@@ eit licenses in Tanzania had discovered . it discovered ships that used several fr@@ au@@ dul@@ ent ident@@ ities and found it @-@ vol@@ at@@ ly ships and found it .
due to his co @-@ operation with Inter@@ pol , the international authority on com@@ b@@ ating crime , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share information on illegal f@@ isheries across large distances and preserved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it builds a system that can help F@@ ISH @-@ i to be suspected ships more precise .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which has always been developed further , helps to hide illegal ships .
&quot; the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position . &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , Head analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg Mat Tra@@ cking , a N@@ RO , which deals with fishing data and F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support .
some of the ships can switch to its automatic identification systems , where they can no longer be changed by satellites .
Cop@@ eland helps to build a system that combines various information on each other . F@@ ISH @-@ i help to find criminal ships with greater precision .
a model program
but F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations can actually take effect on the und@@ ou@@ b@@ tedly global problem of illegal f@@ isheries ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that .
recently , Sky@@ wards recently opened the platform Global F@@ ishing Watch : a platform that offers satellite data , and through which the position of each individual tra@@ ce@@ able ship can be displayed worldwide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order to get a better picture in order to get a better picture of it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to help themselves and to bund@@ le their resources for the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this at global level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project to run on which a global system has the persecution of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities did not only feel crime , but also to re@@ loc@@ ust@@ s .
ships that previously explo@@ ited without license and barely possible to reck@@ on with consequences , we know that they will be observed .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the F@@ ISH @-@ i participating countries have meanwhile a 33 % increase in fishing investments , since then fishing boats could buy more lic@@ ences .
after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia had helped Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found there on board locks , whose use is prohibited .
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other countries notice that success . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is therefore strongly , that we also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have become a study object . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in West Africa , several hundred million dollars annually killed by illegal f@@ isheries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are six countries together , to the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . also , the Il@@ legal F@@ isheries , according to exactly the same model like F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; with safety , the aim is to emer@@ ge even more such initiatives and structures even in other regions , &quot; says Cop@@ eland .
recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s most recent member country asked his first major triumph in October : in October , Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was travelling under false flag and were not only used to drive tra@@ pp@@ le networks , which are now prohibited .
the ship was still so@@ aked in banned waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; take a strong sign that they go against illegal fish catch , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for F@@ ISH @-@ i , this is a further success of many . and at the same time the evidence that such special , collabor@@ ative work is actually working to protect the oceans .

they are considered to protest against the decision of the government to stop the referendum on the President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro .

after the government rejected Venezuela &apos;s request to a referendum on a referendum , the Ven@@ z@@ ol@@ ans responded by negotiations on political and economic crisis in the country , having gathered themselves together in the streets .
at the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the return of Venezuela ) can be found in both pictures of this demonstrations as well as arguments for them .
the debate is also led in other parts of the country - among others in the low@@ lands of Bar@@ inas , in the Andes regions of MÃ©@@ ri@@ da and T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira , centrally located in the central region of MÃ©@@ ri@@ da and Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .

many representatives of the opposition were seen in the opposite of the current President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro . the probability of a re@@ election of the official authorities was finally blo@@ cked .
Mari@@ anne D@@ Ã­@@ az , co @-@ acting at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ ises the context of the Government of Government as follows :
during the framework of social , political and economic crisis , the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % for the annual financial statements , and in which the inflation rate is considered the only way to rec@@ ap@@ ing his institutional structures and close a new government alliance .

particularly large waves beat the news about police repression in the centrally located city of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
there , demonstr@@ ators returned to the local cathedral in order to protect themselves according to his own statement before the police and armed forces .
hours later they were able to leave the cathedral again , but the protests went further .
in other parts of the country some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop police forces , including those woman in the An@@ den@@ staat T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira :
the women in T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira don &apos;t bear a sk@@ irt because it could not see what many nation@@ alities do not have .
meanwhile , there is already a inf@@ ographic the round that forms the magn@@ itude of repression per day :
so the dictatorship has supp@@ ressed the land .
many representatives of the government had asked the validity of the demand for an official approval procedure - this was now demonstrated in the eyes of many people by the presence of numerous people on the street .

the interview was translated into English and is published here with friendly permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qu@@ i@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to view the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argentine city of Cordoba .
as now , Qu@@ i@@ j@@ ano said in the context of the large La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera &apos;s trial in the province of Cordoba against his father .
in the process that ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes were investigated , which have committed during the Argentin@@ ean military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qu@@ i@@ j@@ ano have not found his life .
starting at the BÃ¼r@@ de , same names as his father bear to the brutal military operations in the prison La Per@@ la , which he observed at the age of 15 , he has suffered enough .
for 34 years he held the family secret for himself .
in the situation it was , I thought that was fine .
I felt like a secret mag@@ ician .
as a child with 15 years you do not notice that one is manip@@ ulated by his father .
I could not know that my father was a thief , Fol@@ der and Mur@@ derer .
Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qu@@ i@@ j@@ ano was G@@ end@@ ar@@ eri@@ e@@ beam@@ ter . during the Argentin@@ ean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a period of stat@@ es@@ cal@@ ism , was his father from 1976 to 1978 , had been deputy chief of Intelligence 141 in the prison La Per@@ la .
Luis Alberto Qu@@ i@@ j@@ ano .
archive recording .
this is not the story of Luis Qu@@ i@@ j@@ ano , the oppressed , who was accused of kidn@@ apping in 158 cases , torture , murder in nearly 100 cases and the kidn@@ apping of a 10 @-@ year child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , this is the story of Luis Qu@@ i@@ j@@ anos son , a man who had witn@@ essed over the years the extent of the atro@@ cities which he had experienced as a boy , and he testified against his own father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his story shows what great power is a par@@ ental in his child , and as this child chosen for himself a way of redemption .
from the Sports Hall to the military base
when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . there I went up with a boy who made the fight sport .
all they called it &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ and @-@ white photo and called me to identify my boy@@ friend .
he said :
you are a dick@@ head , you are pleased with one of the ERP .
pass only that they don &apos;t carry you a day , and I must save you .
the ab@@ brevi@@ ation ERP stands for E@@ j@@ Ã©r@@ c@@ ito revolutions of Pueb@@ lo , the Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the Revolutionary Workers Party of Argentina .
therefore he charged me to go into the sports hall again . some days later he took me with the work on the military base .
he said to me , I would be secret .
I was 15 years old and I thought I thought that would be fine . for so my father had moved to me .
on the military base , I had to destroy Pap@@ ers who had heard the det@@ ain@@ ees .
these were all possible documents : university circuits , handwritten notes , Literature , certificates , Prop@@ ag@@ and@@ amat@@ eurs , books , just everything .

&apos;@@ da@@ h the prisoners are tor@@ tured &apos; .
my father took me a total of four times after La Per@@ la with - everything in 1976 .
at the first and last time he left me at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time , he ordered me to get off . he led me to a bar@@ ac@@ ke , in the cars , furniture , television , refriger@@ ators - just all possible - stood .
everything was stolen .
he gave me a small in a blan@@ ket wrap and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a large cl@@ umps in silver .
this day I went to the other end of Bar@@ ac@@ ke , where there were stolen objects and under@@ took me with a guard .
suddenly he interpreted on an open space and said :
then the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
I saw , and saw a song , tor@@ tured on the man .
she looked like a field bed and metal springs .
later I found out that it fast@@ ened to the end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who had just caught there .
they stir@@ red a man with hand @-@ sh@@ ank on the bed , cast it with water and pursued after him a charge of 220 volts to the gen@@ ital@@ ia .

the st@@ ank there was un@@ ce@@ ful ... like a dirty win@@ del .
years later , when my father stood under house arrest , the same smell of his room came .
I recognized the smell immediately and I was clear that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I asked me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How is it possible to do a man so much harm ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ I knew that these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the det@@ ain@@ ees were folded and connected to the det@@ ain@@ ees .
he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; L@@ op@@ ez ( Jose L@@ Ã³@@ pe@@ z , a civilians who was also indicted in the trial ) and I used the opportunity to throw a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background I saw a number of matt@@ resses , on which naked people with the face down below - all were folded at hands and feet .
near the surgery was still quiet for the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father noted that I saw to the prisoner , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you look so , ar@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why did you meet me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed by soldiers .
I know this , because my father told her home .
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms have been designated as offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rom@@ ero had a husband and killed there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( according to survivors of survivors , Jorge Rom@@ ero , who also was indicted in La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera &apos;s trial , was also charged to death Ra@@ Ãº@@ l Mat@@ eo Molina ) .
in the following video , Emil@@ io F@@ essi@@ a , the head of the memorial La Per@@ la , through the former fol@@ klore chambers .
the path , which you came in here , is also the way where we arrived here .
if you look at the map , see that they took about this path and then were tor@@ tured for the first time .
here , their names were changed and they were assigned a number of the process of de@@ struc@@ tions .
when she survived the acts of torture , the prisoners were thrown into cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order of the above mentioned that they should be re@@ located .
this was the lie - the eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of people and disappearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; War yield &apos;
my father brought all possible stolen things to home .
at that time I had no idea that the &quot; mar@@ tial arts &quot; - as they called it .
but when I was later on the military , I was in the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie - I was clear that the yield of a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military badges are to attack an enemy that has fought one enemy .

but if you go into a house and the fridge , the record player , clothes , paintings , money ... ste@@ als , then there is no war yield but V@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
I always asked me how my father , the leader of the security forces , could join this V@@ and@@ alism .
I don &apos;t understand it .
I was an officer in the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie and me it had never fallen to enter into a house and steal all things in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do this .
once he called me a crime and I answered : and you , which you took cars on the street ?
you are no crime ?
he explo@@ ded when he explo@@ ded me , and cried , saying ,
if you walk so far , I will find you and put it on you .
we need none other !
so my father was .
I have no only good memories of him .
when I heard in the process , I showed a photo of that I had a jacket and a roll of wool . both had my father out of La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he still brought clothing with home .
at that time , the defence accused me to have compassion on this crime . I said , no problem , they can lay me at last , what they wanted .
I was anyway to speak .
&apos; the disappearance is the last ab@@ h@@ or act &apos; .
now , where I am older , delicate I Reu@@ ter .
I have children . if you have only children , you know the value of a life .
it develops further and recognizes that it is wrong to kill .
I even went to say so far :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well , you have expressed the dictatorship of mankind during the dictatorship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why do children perform ?
one day brought my father a girl with home , whose mother was killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that a little girl was .
I turned again the question : they were tor@@ tured : but why were they killed ?
they would have just put them into prison .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I guess it was simply chosen to kill those people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they didn &apos;t have families to give up their mort@@ al remains ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the disappearance is the last ab@@ h@@ or act that one can do to man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my father told me when the democracy was re@@ introduced to eliminate them machines to eliminate the mort@@ al remains of the det@@ ain@@ ees .
they were crushed and somewhere - no idea where . &quot; you will never find something , &quot; said my father .
but anything remains of course forever .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen how you killed people ! &apos; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just to declare it : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just simply said the truth about 20 crime - including my father .
the idea to view my father , was originated during a conversation , when he was under house arrest .
I made him homage to him because of all the cru@@ el@@ ih@@ ood that I had to take account of him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he said suddenly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt inner and asked me , why the whole bu@@ oy@@ ancy Patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which they were supposed to have been doing well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then I cried :
how can you say about me ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed terrible crimes and you ur@@ ged me as a child to participate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then don &apos;t forgive me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
exactly what I did .
I depos@@ ited the first ad in 2010 .
I finally knew that he was a criminal responsibility .
no one can re@@ ject me that I am vo@@ re@@ ingen@@ ious . I finally told my own father .

translation errors makes older people in Kyoto on &quot; terrible drivers &quot;
the sign with the translation errors in a center in Kyoto , where one can extend its driving licence .
the photo was spread in the social media .
editing of the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened center in which one can extend its leadership , in the last month witnesses of a completely failed translation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on a shield , the Japanese word ( co@@ rei@@ den@@ ten@@ sh@@ a ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; means , sp@@ aw@@ ful - perhaps also with b@@ ying back@@ drop &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; as &quot; fear@@ ful motor@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was reading from 1 to 20 September to electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself .
adaptation of the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine , which was multiple divided into social media .
the error was the trans@@ lat@@ ors of Julian Holmes , a inhabitants Ky@@ ot@@ os , had fallen , it was too atten@@ tive to the local time .
the Kyoto @-@ based daily Kyoto Shim@@ bu@@ n wrote :
&quot; how could it happen to such an English translation ?
this proves that no man has read the translation correction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a question for elderly people and an international city as Kyoto simply un@@ acceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holmes &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the faul@@ ty English translation was initially removed . the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear@@ ful drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) was later replaced by the appropriate time when the gramm@@ ar is not correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ der drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police pre@@ fecture in Kyoto was responsible for the translation errors . still explained that the error was already contained in the text which they had been checked by trans@@ lat@@ ors and that the translation has not been checked for their accuracy before it was published .
a blo@@ g@@ ger reported as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sorry , we &apos;re sorry that older people were off@@ ended with the in@@ sufficient correction ( the translation ) on the other hand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Japanese online news service J @-@ cast News continued a bit more detailed with the phenomenon of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot;
the word &quot; aw@@ ful &quot; was taken as an adequate description for older drivers . according to the police , the proportion of elderly drivers who are involved in accidents are in accidents , but are quite anxi@@ ety .
in the Kyoto pre@@ fecture , for example , 1.@@ 9@@ 41 of a total of 19.@@ 460 accidents caused by the elderly in 2005 . this corresponds to a share of 10 % .
ten years later , in 2014 , seniors was 1.8@@ 03 from a total of 11.@@ 850 accidents .
this increased its share to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents fell down in total , the proportion of senior citizens caused by the elderly in the same period .
the well @-@ known repor@@ ter was published in the article comments published by the article comments on the light that show what pre@@ judi@@ ces some Japanese are seem@@ ingly against older drivers :
the article on Yahoo about the translation errors got the following comments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is this ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear@@ ful drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) is not the reality ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
- &quot; If f@@ law@@ less is the translation actually not , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
- &quot; I don &apos;t think that is a real translation error . &quot;
there are not few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is widespread in all Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and all Asia .
the En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com website is a true foundation stone for these bizar@@ re errors in English .

the reasons for the wide distribution of translation defects are diverse .
for example , you are needed to understand two important abilities : passive language skills to understand the output text and active language skills to transmit him into the target language .
the latter requires the active rule of the target language - something that is in the native language . generally , trans@@ lat@@ ors shall be in the target language - not in the language language - not in the language language - native language .
so , a French mother language should translate from the English into French - not from French into English .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r users Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies employ no staff with English as a native language that could translation translations into English . this may have a lack of understanding for Excel , cost @-@ reasons or the relatively small number of English speakers that speaks Japanese .
some companies that have no foreign employees have to make translation work together . then the Japanese employees , whose English is the best in@@ scri@@ bed , trans@@ lat@@ ors - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really good .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r users Karl Baron .
machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results .
the wor@@ r@@ enti@@ oned phr@@ ases that arise from mechan@@ ic translations , show that this technique can replace another human trans@@ lat@@ ors . this applies to some languages .
some of the most strange English formulation in Japan , among them also decor@@ ate the sound pressure , which often uses T @-@ shirts or pockets , are only used for stylish reasons - not to be read or understood .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ User Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors like jewelry still un@@ acceptable or at least harm@@ less . but by major companies or from the government who have funds to ensure higher standards , you can expect more detailed translations .
the city of Kyoto uses in future hope for their translations .
Venezuela : protests and affiliate measures on the Internet and television
main page of Port@@ als &quot; Nav@@ ac@@ con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( Free Sur@@ fing ) of the IP@@ YS ( Institu@@ to PR@@ EN@@ SA y Soci@@ ed@@ ad , Institute of Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , 7th April , Venezu@@ elan Internet users that they had no access to online broad@@ caster Viv@@ op@@ lay .
later , other users wrote that the Internet connection of V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV must be no longer accessible .
other online stations also contributed to the protests of the protests in Caracas , which were organized by op@@ positioned groups who re@@ vo@@ ke the Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ u@@ ros government .
the protests began in early April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the tasks of the parliament to the executive and the Supreme Court .
Luis Carlos D@@ Ã­@@ az , journalist and author of Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a Tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection is to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet .
# Z@@ ens@@ or@@ ship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that internet pages of Venezu@@ elan providers are re@@ closed again .
that is from the site of @ Viv@@ o@@ Play@@ Net .
offers like Viv@@ op@@ lay during vene@@ ers with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest .
in 2014 , traditional media has been on protests in excess of protests . then the Commission threatened to report them with money @-@ pen@@ alties and closure , when the Commission would continue to report this as a &quot; call for violence . &quot;
without cable TV and informative national TV channels , I log@@ ged in @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
amazing that it &apos;s still cheaper than two liters of lim@@ on@@ ade .
the local NGO Association @-@ fil@@ tro confirmed that only Viv@@ op@@ lay was not accessible due to a blocking of the domain name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online broad@@ casts . this also concerns the website where the National Assembly transfers its sessions .
earlier re@@ resear@@ ches of the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had revealed that the local Internet providers can use DNA . these are a technology , which answer the DNS server of certain domains .
if a website is blo@@ cked by DNS , the server answers a faul@@ ty or refuse the request to enter such a website .
we confirm a DNS lock : @ el@@ il@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
at V@@ P@@ IT@@ V , a third party , the transmission was discontinued on Thursday , April 6 , when the V@@ P@@ IT@@ V @-@ Camera @-@ camera Elvis Flo@@ res was carried out live in Caracas .
Flo@@ res was beaten , while he was found in police custody .
eight hours later he was released , and V@@ P@@ IT@@ V returned to con@@ sign@@ ment again .
although some channels are still accessible from YouTube , so that the government regul@@ ates the Internet connections : this means the dental vene@@ ers of access to multi media coverage about the current events in the country is still better .
in Paraguay many girls will become a slave to get a training
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a child of Cri@@ ad@@ ita . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
today Tina is fighting for the rights of children and collec@@ ts witness other Cri@@ ad@@ itas , who were exactly like they were victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the licensed version of a report by Kur@@ tur@@ ally , which is published by Global Vo@@ ices with the friendly permission of the authors .
the article is part of a series with the title &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ elan , es@@ cu@@ elas , Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; F@@ lying cows , falling Schools &quot; ) which will be edited by Global Vo@@ ices in Latin America .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived for eight years in a household , where she was not living together with the family who lived there .
shortly before their study &apos;s degree in the university , she returned once again into the house and heard how the owner of the house full of pride over them said . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the one that has become something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old , she started working as Cri@@ ad@@ ita for the family . as Cri@@ ad@@ itas , one named in Paraguay the more than 46@@ ,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the shop is very simple : a big family with little money over their min@@ ors son or her minor daughter to another , more abundant family . in the exchange the child receives food , an apprentices@@ hip and a roof over the head .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but what would not be mentioned , the children must be paid for countless days of work , who can never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go , practice is widespread in Paraguay due to participation and acceptance by large parts of the society and in spite of numerous symptoms of human rights organizations .
after completing her studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked some years for an organization that fought for the rights of boys and girls .
in the case , she said with Cri@@ ad@@ itas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected testimonies , calcul@@ ating and delayed .
in general , you tried to call the things in the name , because the feeling of grat@@ itude , which is vacc@@ inated in Cri@@ ad@@ itas .
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
there is also the family that their daughter in the faith , that they will improve so their training , their position in society and , &quot; there can be something of himself to another family .
on the other hand , the family , which takes the girl with itself and whose exploitation is just@@ i@@ fies with faith , that they would not give someone a chance that would have won &apos;t be hungry , and maybe even was hungry .
the Vic@@ tims of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
when the girl is har@@ assed , his family will be experienced only many years later .
sometimes they never experienced it .
so far , in January 2016 , the relatively unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the secret households in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , but a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n arrived in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ Ãº in hospital , showed her body traces of severe b@@ lows . shortly after , she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ ad@@ ita in the household of former military officer Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ re@@ ira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as an officer in the residence .
Mar@@ Ã­n lived with them in the house of V@@ aqu@@ er@@ Ã­a , a small town located at only 3,000 inhabitants , located 250 kilometers east of the capital of As@@ unci@@ on .
at the end of January 2016 Fer@@ re@@ ira struck Fer@@ re@@ ira at the end of January 2016 until it suffered deadly injury .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
some days later the media reported about the incident .
they emphas@@ ized that the murdered child was a Cri@@ ad@@ ita .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; organizations such as UNICEF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the deep in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen Society of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go for the death of the girl . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they recorded the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came to protest attacks together and demanded that there will be no further Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widespread in social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay more cows are registered as children , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
without papers , it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children .
without official documents it is very difficult to control , under which conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbours of the wife and nearly 60 civil society organizations demanded an excellent investigation of the case .
they want to be sentenced by Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ re@@ ira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl who had been sentenced to 30 years in prison .
if the fall of judgment comes , the case of Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n could be setting up for the first time in the history of Paraguay , a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go before judgment .
everyday life of a Cri@@ ad@@ ita
Cri@@ ad@@ itas will not only explo@@ ited as labour force , they are also isolated from other girls in their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bi@@ k worked as the Far@@ bi@@ k , where their father had to register and lost his work .
your brothers had to go all work and started to sell money on the road or on the market swe@@ ets to earn money .
but they went on to school .
only Tina was sent as Cri@@ ad@@ ita in the capital As@@ unci@@ on .
in the house of its employer Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was working between four and six hours every day .
it had to divide the time so that you still remained for learning to learning .
it stood every morning against five o &apos;clock and prepared the breakfast for their employers .
on Friday for example , she cleansed the refrigerator , the living room , polished the furniture and the infected ground .
when the school was at the end , she went home and had time for learning .
the more they were ready with learning , the more leisure had her .
but this time was limited , because they had to make dinner for their employer .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she had to hunger , but did not get unlimited food . &quot; I could get more books from the library of the house of the house as food from the fridge , &quot; she reminds me .
the library was well equipped and belonged to the budget , a former military and sympath@@ izers of the Parti@@ do liberal , a liberal party , who belonged to the dictatorship of Alfredo Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who belonged to the opposition from 1954 until 1989 .
in some evenings of the N@@ var@@ eng@@ a House@@ hold Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , next to him and guiding article from opposition time like &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pueb@@ lo &quot; .
in doing so , he tried to convince her to give the reports of the official media about the regime of dict@@ ator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he was indeed for intelligent , but did not take with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the stew@@ ards had found someone who heard of politics while he spoke about politics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they didn &apos;t allow me to visit my family because they were there again &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bad An@@ hab@@ its &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they mean that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a that belongs to the indigenous group of the Guaran@@ i , at home again &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Guaran@@ i &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their lord feared that they had the education that they had made , they would lose it again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it was completely clear that she had paid for everything they had paid for them with their hard work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also in school , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discrimin@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing that is almost never spoken , mo@@ b@@ bing and ch@@ ic@@ ans are exposed to those Cri@@ ad@@ itas &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because the other children have their parents , they immediately acknowledge that someone who has no parents , a Cri@@ ad@@ ita .
I was able to invite you to home . I had no circle of friends in school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , at the time where friends are created , I felt very much that I was one member .
the isolation was the worst of everything , &quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a explains .
the Society approved the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a fac@@ ebook group in which you can have priority for cleaning staff and child care in Paraguay .
the administration of the group is pep@@ a Kost@@ i@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a city of city in As@@ unci@@ on .
hello ! I &apos;m looking for a small companion for my little daughter , who in the morning and in the afternoon with her .
to learn .
please call you .
beginning on Monday , if possible .
the ad got five &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; and many comments .
a woman from the site Ã@@ em@@ by wrote that she would have a year @-@ old girl and gave her phone number .
another woman , which also came from Ã@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 @-@ year old ni@@ ece . &quot; she loves little children and is very pretty , &quot; wrote her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the third commentary &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a girl from the Interior , which wants to work &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the author gets into the ad once more :
Dear friends , I have found one . I look , if it works with her .
thank you , I am writing , if something is something .
the shop was complete .
in the Pro@@ log report to Cri@@ ad@@ itas , Â¿ Hair sta cu@@ Ã¡n@@ do ?
( Cri@@ ad@@ itas , how long yet ? ) , a collection of testimonies , former Cri@@ ad@@ itas , writes Or@@ ti@@ z :
in the course of our history we managed to raise up systems like slavery , Cu@@ Ã±@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( one practice from the French conqu@@ ist@@ adors &quot; ) , at which the Spanish conqu@@ ist@@ adors had to give them tribute to women and boys in one system of slavery , where they will always give light victims for abuse and exploitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the social in@@ equality in Paraguay and the show of power are the key to the understanding of the phenomena as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Legislative bill to register social media in front of the government to register against the government

sixty Egyptian members have recently agreed a bill to &quot; regul@@ ating the regulations regarding use and use of social networks . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he is adopted by the Parliament , users must register for social media in Egypt with a government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law then a place would then be established that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; civil servants and citizens would have permission to share social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
within six months with the adoption of the law , users would have to register for users with their right name and identity numbers to use social networks .
if it is missed to do this , this could bring a penalty of up to six months &quot; imprisonment or a fine of money .
the bill , which consists of six paragra@@ phs , and in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media than &quot; jed@@ we@@ de application that runs over the internet and used to communicate with others by voice , video explanation and text . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is un@@ clear how the law shall be established , as Egyptian government shall not make suggestions , such as Egyptian authorities should not register upon account of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently not able to guarantee the regulation on the level of social media companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , Parliament of Parliament , told the magazine Al Monitor , registered users and users received a password &quot; to enter a password by the Firewall gate , the Facebook . &quot;
that could mean that Egypt is planning a fire@@ wall on national level around Facebook . due to them it would be necessary to submit information to the Egyptian and Egyptians to access the network to the network .
but it is not known so far that such plans exist .
experts and experts are sc@@ ep@@ tical regarding the technical fe@@ asi@@ bility of the alleg@@ ations .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ological ( in German &quot; senior Resear@@ chers &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices :
I strongly eng@@ aging the technical capacity and the understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things that have to do with technology .
in my opinion , they imagine that just as they were able to control physical public and private spaces , it could also be done online .
if I think it , then means that they are able to establish a strong surveillance system to con@@ struct citizens , or not . and this means a crazy system to monitor the activities of the people and to bring it to a trial process .
this is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed at the elections of the Parliament and the Constitutional Commit@@ tees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether his acceptance and en@@ forcement has been successful , or not , the draft &quot; stands in line with a pro @-@ military thinking in parliament , whose sens@@ es shall be changed and ensured that no different sc@@ ents are present on the image area , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of .
last year , Tam@@ er El @-@ Sh@@ ah@@ aw@@ y proposed a legislative position against cy@@ ber Cri@@ me in which a life @-@ term sentence for those intended to thre@@ aten &quot; public order to thre@@ aten &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; to protest . &quot;

high above in the mountains of the region of Kurdistan in the Nor@@ theast of Iraq have been working on the animal hus@@ band@@ man H@@ ana Ahmed R@@ aza and their team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organization Nature Iraq to protect the intellectual le@@ op@@ le@@ op@@ ards .
a sub@@ species of the bigger family of le@@ op@@ ards , which through Africa and Asia belong to the Persian Leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . in total , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are due to Wil@@ der@@ ei , loss and frag@@ mentation of their hab@@ itat , and as they always find less prey .
why is this certain type of le@@ op@@ ards so important ?
like R@@ aza in the video shows , &quot; the Persian is the only remainder of the Kur@@ dish ecos@@ ystem &quot; and the health and the growth of the ecos@@ ystem also depends on that a big cat@@ fish is present .
the chance to see a Persian Leop@@ ards indeed in the free bo@@ bs@@ lei@@ gh , is low and goes to zero . as the team in the video is that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera , R@@ aza breaks out of pure joy .
as trained Bi@@ olog@@ in shows R@@ aza passionate about another site of their country , which consists not only of war and conflict .
she has been involved in field studies on wild animals and educational programs for six years .

at the beginning of March 2017 , the daily newspaper K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o , the progress made in the northeast of Japan were affected by the &quot; Thir@@ ty catastrophe &quot; of March 2011 . a massive earthquake , an ts@@ un@@ ami and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hima had triggered the catastrophe .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Zeitung is located in An@@ ai , which lies in the Pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ fecture . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ fecture in Japan . the Pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was to experience both the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neigh@@ bor of Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate were forced , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had van@@ ished from the map .
even for this , the Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ fecture had experienced a nuclear accident , even so alone , 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their houses .
the special report of the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o shows the progress made from local view which have been achieved six years later to re@@ build the life of local companies .
the detailed report of the newspaper includes both statistics of Japanese re@@ building authority as well as survey results of the affected themselves .
the housing estate in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Zeitung reports that 77 per cent of the planned spare parts ( the world &apos;s planned spare part ) , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate were finished .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i &apos;s greatest success could be found in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i &apos;s three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , 80 percent of the planned spare parts were completed .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 per cent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hima remains the final light after Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
nevertheless , six years after the catastrophe , evacu@@ ated by accommodation in the catastrophe , evacu@@ ated by Beh@@ el @-@ contrac@@ ted ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) in final spare parts .
after the Thir@@ ty catastrophe , almost 80 000 people were forced to live in accommodation at home .
still 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate still lived in such services .
almost 40 per cent of the Fu@@ kus@@ hima happened in the evacu@@ ation of Fu@@ kus@@ hima . more than 75 per cent of the evacu@@ ation that were evacu@@ ated after the disaster in accommodation , were settled in final homes .
for I@@ w@@ ate the number is 34 percent .
the state of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
like the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Zeitung , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools have been affected by the cal@@ am@@ ity , opened its doors to December 2016 , which makes nearly 98 percent of schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later , the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures are far more difficult .
while nearly 100 per cent of f@@ isheries airports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are back into operation , only 30 percent of fishing ports have been re@@ opened their operation in Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and nuclear accident , took place in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures agricultural land large area .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i could restore 93 percent of its agricultural land , only 66 percent of the farm@@ land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed the farm@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
it is un@@ likely that this is just a result of atomic fact , because only 690 hectares of vineyards destroyed the farm@@ land of Fu@@ kus@@ hima , in the nuclear sector . &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has once again recovered , but there remains Fu@@ kus@@ hima far back .
the tourist figures in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are back up to 90 percent on the same stand as before the disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hima however can only have 75 percent .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Zeitung reports that since the disaster has almost half of the coastal towns , it is more difficult to earn their hab@@ it .
is the native population prepared for the next big earthqu@@ akes ?
in order to determine the overall image , the newspaper introduced numerous surveys under the local population and under the evacu@@ ated population . she asked them about the state of re@@ building and also how their receiving can be changed across the ts@@ un@@ ami risk .
in her introduction of the article the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Zeitung explains :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o led a survey conducted by more about the ts@@ un@@ ami consciousness among the native population of experience .
the survey carried out that 8@@ 3.1 percent of resident population have taken hold , to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.9 percent of respon@@ dents say that still not enough in cat@@ ast@@ roph@@ es prevention has been done .
as it stands for those who had to evacu@@ ated from the Fu@@ kus@@ hima Pre@@ fecture
in its issue on the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper has strengthened their attention to the situation of evacu@@ ated Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
Fu@@ kus@@ hima had not only had to experience the devastating earthquake and devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima was also a witness of the worst , disast@@ rous accident in Japan .
nearly 63 000 people were moved from Fu@@ kus@@ hima region , nearly 63 000 people were moved outside the pre@@ fecture .
at the beginning of 2016 , some more than 23 000 people were settled back to Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
after 2017 , still 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hima still live in their home pre@@ fecture .
most of the evacu@@ ations are most of the evacu@@ ations , which still are still in behavi@@ our@@ ers , because the efforts are competing for the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hima . this is a building projects that are part of the Olympic Games in Tokyo by 2020 .
the world is small : our Pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
if one met people from other countries who speak a different language , the differences seem to be bigger than the simil@@ ar@@ ities .
however , after a while , you often recognize that one more links to the first sight .
these global links are important , since they require our pre@@ judi@@ ces , our perspectives expand and remind us that the world finally is very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we &apos;ll show us exactly these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we deal with topics that often get less attention when they earn .
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who recall a moment in which they have felt very strong with someone about language and country limits .
Veron@@ iki Kri@@ kon@@ i speaks about the simil@@ ar@@ ities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i M@@ aci@@ as speaks about the time where she worked with people from around the world in London ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences which he collected in a small village in Madagascar .

a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the Inten@@ sive Care : last Friday , a police officer was defeated in a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , with a stroke against the head . in nationwide , millions of demonstr@@ ators participated in a protest march towards savings .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , studied social sciences at the Federal University of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s , has suffered a skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma and several fra@@ c@@ tures .
doctors worked it on this Saturday , and now brought him into an artificial comp@@ el .
its condition is considered critical .
the local photo journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus which quickly spread themselves within a few days .
on the pictures , the face of the police officers can be seen , who identified with a stroke attack . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s announced that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o was suspended until the end of the investigation of the previous service was suspended .
the pictures show the police officers , as he proposes in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia and his stroke on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
would be a police officer of a demonstr@@ ators by demonstr@@ ators and on the Inten@@ sive Care Station , would be able to see his face six months in television and the whole oppression would be justified .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ ol@@ al@@ iz@@ ador , &quot; a press channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , divided by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z , in which one sees , as Mat@@ eus sitting by the police officer and several sanitary ware shortly after him .
another video with the same scenes , but from another perspective , is also di@@ pped in social networks .
clip shown below shows the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus , which lives in another state , Internet users have donated 10,000 Brazilian re@@ ais ( approximately 2,@@ 700 Euro ) to stay one part of the cost of medical treatment and to stay in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , while he is in the hospital .
be vali@@ ant , Mat@@ eus .

on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for more violent attacks against activists in Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s
Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s experiences a wave of political force : here is the activ@@ ist Gu@@ il@@ her@@ me Irish of his father , because he was murdered in the intensive care of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , who had been attacked by a polic@@ emen who had been attacked by a polic@@ emen who struck him with a stroke .
police disp@@ rop@@ es
Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s was not the only state in Brazil where there was a police custody on the last Friday in the last Friday .
polic@@ emen sat at protests in the center of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had built a stage for Red@@ ner , rubber and dr@@ unk@@ en@@ as .
member of the Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Peace Party ( PS@@ OL ) , asked the police via loudspeaker to sei@@ ze violence against demonstr@@ ators .
it also includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers throughout the country .
once again , the Brazilian media street protests , having their focus on another , unexpected prot@@ agon@@ ists : a window disc .
the following ha de S. Paulo and est@@ ado de S. Paulo reported specifically about a broken glass window to illustr@@ ate with a photograph of the cover page .
on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o preferred a title story with a fire on fire .
there is no pl@@ au@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason , more about a broken window disc than the protests of thousands of people who serve the defense of a special thing to report .
this must also be seen , if you are stri@@ pped against any form of non @-@ damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also here the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ and@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is ab@@ sur@@ d , disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ate importance , and the typical violence of the military police are dealt with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; demonstr@@ ators on con@@ front@@ ation course with the police &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the villages of un@@ du@@ str@@ alization forgotten villages in Cuba
with the introduction of the law of Ã@@ l@@ var@@ o Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugar tubes factories throughout Cuba is the doors ( Photo : Juli@@ o B@@ atist@@ a ) .
the Municipality of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ i , who is located in the western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is widely known as el Central - on Spanish sugar mill - known , regardless that there is no significant sugar seriously harvest@@ ed on site .
it is two years ago when the activities in the sugar cane factories were laid .
after the nar@@ ro@@ wer the sugar cane industry in the region , and the factory lost after and after its plants , until only the rum@@ or made of steel and concrete remained .
about 272 workers had to inv@@ ent themselves .
some changes the work .
others signed and comm@@ its daily to the factories which still grin@@ d .
N@@ ene , a solo veter@@ an , who stand up every day at 4 : 00 am , the crisis in the sugar tube industry does not smoke his sleep .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he heard that in the east of the region of sugar pipe plants , which are back in operation after long in@@ active times , because they were received . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was something that he was not expected .
N@@ ene reminds itself exactly that in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ I would receive the sugar cane factory , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar cane industry resist@@ or already the pl@@ agues , the fall of Soci@@ alism , the low market prices , the ill @-@ efficiency , the poor management decision and climate change .
in 2016 , the production was 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than 1910 produced .
the message would have been a motive for some decades ago , but the bad ones have already been no new .
why was the Cuban sugar tub@@ ing industry switched off ?
the old railway platform of the congregation already saw even better times .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ atist@@ a )
the reduction of the sugar tube industry was an economical necessity : the 155 sugar tubes factories were technically ob@@ sol@@ ete , and hardly competitive they were in@@ car@@ able for the country .
the initial idea was to concentrate on the most efficient factories , the annual production target was 4 million tonnes .
they left only the factories that can produce sugar for maximum 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the moti@@ fs that led to such measures were the low productivity of the sugar cane plant@@ ations and the future rise in the world market .
nevertheless , the sugar price increased from about a decade .
from 2017 to 2025 , the prize of un@@ refined sugar between the ages of 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os must remain , according to the report , &quot; Agricultural Working Perspectives &quot; by the OECD and FAO , the Agriculture and Food Organization of the United Nations .
if the current production would achieve the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar would generate about $ 85 million for the country .
not all ran good
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day with security in history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were the first words of the Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began .
in the following years the dis@@ closure of a total of 98 sugar tubes , more than 65 million people received their full support for further education .
the same thing happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ Ã©e Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ i on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto PÃ©@@ rez worked in the factory since 1967 .
when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , about the closure of the factory , is the word that he repeated most repeatedly , &quot; deceit . &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents are in the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
so that the place will get , they watched a full time - Working Group .
before the first break year , the first letters began to come .
it was officially written documents that are only classified as part of the parts that would be removed , the address sat and the date .
all were signed by Ul@@ timo Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the Minister could appro@@ ve any withdrawal .
from there the responsibility has been transferred to the responsibility and the letters were more common .
Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the set @-@ down factory for two years , and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money , insured for the still in operation . &quot;
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , waiting for retirement in another plant , Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was involved in his will at the stand@@ still of the factory , whose construction he helped himself .
with every part that he removed , he dismant@@ led one of his 31 work years .
the best developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important work producers developed .
in many cases , there were no alternative alternatives for work and services that were generated in the churches in which they found themselves .
we will never know whether during the Mamm@@ alog@@ y speech of 21 October 2002 , then president in the eyes of the present persons saw , when he guaranteed for the areas whose factories had no longer run in operation since five years .
the price of the population for closing the sugar tubes
since 2004 , sugar cane is only extracted by grinding .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ atist@@ a )
after two years the community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ I learned that there will change many things , but not always for better if a factory is closed .
when the sugar tube factory lock , or better said , when they started to destroy it , they also heard that the road list@@ ens to asp@@ hal@@ ian , this also dis@@ advant@@ ageous to other establishments .
without work in the region , and with advanced ages , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy other factories had to be present .
they were too spare parts .
without a future perspective , many young people left the region .
in the area a food factory created , whose production is not used for the supply of the assembly .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant is still impressive .
at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene came back to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he started working .
Ne@@ un@@ und@@ alk bring the old soldiers to spend a R@@ ente of two thousand pes@@ o per month to spend the years in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ i .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man black skin colour , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is no subsequent person , yet he awards the lies that told him .
they have been qu@@ eu@@ pon for ten years .
N@@ ene goes with 65 years in R@@ ente , not because it is missing at power , but because it is bitter .

the youth of the First Nations communities in all Canada are dealing with topics that are important to them . they do they do with hip hop , thanks to a number of hiking workshops .
as part of the N &apos; we J@@ in@@ an @-@ Tour since 2014 workshop manager mobile audio studios directly to schools and youth centers to accommodate young groups Song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live appearances .
the original workshops were initiated by the ped@@ agogue David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and in North @-@ Quebec , with ten cre@@ e communities , and then working with the Cre@@ e H@@ ip @-@ Hop @-@ Gruppe The North@@ Stars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the workshop will increase that the young participant in talks like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cultural identity , language , conflict , love , self @-@ acceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or what can still be found in the sense . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos , in which the young people are the main actors .
because workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organ@@ ise similar workshops with the trunk of Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the U.S. state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
for example , this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ yo@@ o is told in the area of the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , called Highway 16 , also &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; in which almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered .
the cases were largely implemented .
the next video of the Nem@@ o Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motif of a video player to mediate , as important of the receipt of traditional customs and customs despite the influence through glob@@ alisation .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people are not always alleged to rule the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation will have recorded the refra@@ ction in Cre@@ e .
the young people received a little help of Gary J@@ olly from the North@@ stars H@@ ip @-@ Hop , which gave them a stub@@ born in dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e .

sometimes I feel when nobody would like to be interested in me
but I try to go on earth my days on earth
that is the day that you will take our scre@@ am
because we lost our way as a youth in life
but I believe that we will lift up one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
so they can grow and also ours of our youth
so you can do it , for what it is appointed to the Creator

in Japan you can see nearly every restaurant plastic dishes .
to show the potential customers , what exactly is on the menu , are located in the vicinity of the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( the fact , &quot; plastic models of dishes &quot; ) of each food which is served in this restaurant .
the customers can see these plastic dishes and decide whether they enter the restaurant or continue .
there are one industry , dedicated to manufacturing of these plastic dishes .
in the K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi &apos;s district K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi there is a multitude of these small companies that produce those plastic film@@ makers W@@ im Wen@@ ders in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago .
for most Japanese these are these plastic dishes so usually that they are not even more to all . a new trend turns them today into a consp@@ ic@@ uous mobile accessory and other g@@ ad@@ gets .
at N@@ aver Mat@@ ome published the B@@ logger it@@ ini@@ i series of social media links and photos , which show this unusual tw@@ ist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin purple .
now in special sale : new with plastic shred@@ ded mobile phone t@@ apes , as shown in K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u Kauf@@ haus .
many of these artificial foods were turned into kit@@ ten items such as in this case , e@@ at@@ ched cabinet :
here are some Sho@@ es e@@ at@@ mag@@ nets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom of the essence is increasingly more complex .
in this case , a ka@@ isen @-@ don ( a popular travel shell ) was transformed into a mobile stand .
for these tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use of mobile devices .
also this part we have produced for the exhibition in Tokyo Train Station .
and here is a apple , who hold your mobile phone :
designed to look like a apple , with a guy for the mobile phone , this is a great design .
and this is just the beginning of an increasing flight .
some phone support and mobile designers allow you to create your own artwork . in this case , ik@@ ura or sal@@ mon will be used , a popular T@@ opping , which is served with white rice .
on Twitter some users had their doub@@ ts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is someone who would say that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wow , cool , now I can beat my mobile with sal@@ mon ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
this interest in plastic dishes can also assume a less appet@@ ite form to surprise colleagues or family members un@@ pleasant .
our latest mobile stand has the shape of melting ice .
furthermore there are rice balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , earrings and hand@@ rails of dried sal@@ mon .
more sk@@ ur@@ r@@ ile plastic dishes can view it at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s N@@ aver Mat@@ ome Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow Twitter on the h@@ ash@@ tag # , the belief of the world .
if you want to know more about the origin of this trends , then you will give you an insight into the district of K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi , which is dedicated to the restaurant industry . like , for example with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ be san@@ pur@@ u .
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes actually are manufactured .
a Mexican project tells the stories of the survivors of fighting against humanity .

in reports in@@ - and foreign media reports about the not@@ ori@@ ous &quot; fight against drug traff@@ icking in Mexico . these reflected not only in statistics . these reflected not the extent of the human tragedy against that this struggle with itself .
the reporting on drug bos@@ ses like El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ Ã¡n , chief of the Sin@@ al@@ oa cart@@ el , ur@@ ged the stories of the conflict in the background .
on the day after a violent incident , someone looks to the grief or to the churches that have learned to live with the pain .
behind each tin , behind each bone structure in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners are never able to heal their wo@@ unds .
for this reason , the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ ti@@ co has called the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vi@@ r C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; with the drug traff@@ icking , &quot; ) to give a voice , and stories of man tells the battle between the prosecution authorities and cart@@ els .
animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ ti@@ co describes the project so :
organis@@ ational crimes can not only fear our lives .
the effects are much pro@@ found .
for example , if business close , because they are threatened by drug traff@@ icking , and throughout the congregations will have to leave many kilometers to buy something like milk .
the pain of the victim
a video with the title &quot; Vi@@ das que cam@@ ore p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; how fear life changes &quot; ) tells exactly these stories .
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father , who sear@@ ches every weekend secret graves after his son .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ Ã­@@ guez that lost their father and two brothers and their ne@@ phe@@ w in just one day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; priest : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how every Sunday we prepare ourselves to the task which we have asked us to get rid of the graves after the people who loved us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in a electro@@ shop in El N@@ aran@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
on October 15th he was back again , but he never returned . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very difficult for me , because I am now with three children who need training .
there is also my mother , which is also with me here .
at the moment it has no income .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you will not receive the insurance of my father , but they don &apos;t pay off , because a death certificate will require . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
where should we get it ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ un@@ a vivi@@ r con el nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must show the international community , the conflicts , frag@@ ility and the State . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ HB , a reader of Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ ti@@ co , wrote this article from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in Central alm@@ ex@@ iko .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your contribution reminds us that violence should never be considered normal , no matter , in which form it occurs : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have been aware of the disease and sens@@ ation journ@@ alism since some years now .
I pass every day on newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks and see the cover pages with pictures , which actually only consists of a textbook for crimin@@ ology or out of specialists .
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I feel the feeling as if I am the sin@@ ful , the attached or sad . it works as a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body .
I can not be equal or consider this as normal .
she writes on :
no , it is not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old c@@ ousin is considering that he is big . and it is not normal that people songs over the &quot; hel@@ per &quot; of the offen@@ ders , when they go through the streets .
for me , it is , as if they have lost those who have lost someone and those who fear them also something .
I see our weakness when stories are going to blo@@ c numbers in a statistic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the facts of man is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students will be justified in a neighbouring village . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think they are trying to speak of such trage@@ dies if they are not stirring and still . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution &quot; four months of Er@@ press@@ or in the main city area : like a family with thre@@ ats . it describes how armed Cri@@ me month was destroyed by their business until they were not only destroyed by the business but also her family fell apart .
you think about everything you lost and remember how many people can change your life in just a few days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the pain will never go , the trau@@ ma remains very high , when you are alone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hab@@ its have changed , phone numbers also .
we just contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
each other we are removed , the better .
she completed her report with the words :
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to be arrested for others , because they don &apos;t know when they will kill you or kill you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I asked myself in those fear@@ ful days if weeping would redeem my deep@@ ening feelings , but the answer is no , because I have forgotten , as you weep . I have to learn how to live with the pain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ Ã©r@@ rez published the article &quot; The For@@ gotten Children of Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez : one of the generation of violence . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the introduction he raises questions on how , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who care about the child of a missed woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how is it to grow up in a settlement on the edge of the endangered city of Mexican ?
he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents take care of them .
Br@@ yan is a Wa@@ ise and he tells about how to make a egg coo@@ ks , potatoes , tort@@ illas warm and &quot; Ch@@ ich@@ i &quot; for the babies that makes it with him . this is his name for the preparation of the bottle with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for each year of life .
but they are in@@ significant in comparison to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for the whole life of violence , and who had to learn to live thereby .
when he was five years old , he said to him that his mother may have disappeared .
but this was not the day that ended his childhood .
his childhood was over two years earlier , when he was just a few blocks away from his home , the bloody dead bodies of his father , who was shot by armed men from an exempl@@ ary car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez was seen :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 as a violent crime was mixed by the organized crime and struggle against the existing social problems in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world , due to the number of murder , according to the Federal Council for Public Safety and Government of the United States government .
in 2010 alone , the Pro@@ sec@@ ution filed 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this corresponds to an average of 8.5 Mor@@ ning per day .
these are just a few hundred thousand stories that organized the organized crime in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country .
only few stories are still alive in view of a new stroke . this project reminds us of those who are not allowed to forget .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vi@@ r C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; has established the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ al@@ co in 2015 to present the complex information behind the drug traff@@ icking , which has held the country in the past four decades , in an comprehen@@ sible manner .

the fact check is important in a moment in which it comes to raise a rum@@ or or for@@ f@@ eit a f@@ ake .
but how is the years after something is di@@ pped the first time ? content in social media , no matter whether or true , tend to exist .
let us take this photo of a terrible accident in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) seven years ago .
since its first publication , it was used to have been mis@@ leading , trage@@ dies that actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false copy of image and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Draft News - den@@ ies not the fact that there is plenty of careful reporting of events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but he th@@ rows any questions about our desire after images . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 , a tank @-@ wagons crossed the place S@@ ange at the East of the DR Congo , til@@ ed and explo@@ ded . about 230 people came to life .
according to civil war in Africa , the country was neg@@ lec@@ ted , and thereby devast@@ ated . the streets in the region have become too dangerous pa@@ ge@@ ons , which were difficult to drive .
Trag@@ ically fell to the tan@@ kers to sacrifice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Illu@@ sion@@ ists described a fire@@ ball , covered houses including one cinema in the vicinity that was full of people who illustr@@ ate the soccer World Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
houses disper@@ sed and carbon@@ ated cor@@ p@@ ses in the streets .
many people were burned to the trouble .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a picture with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is Nigeria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from Im@@ g@@ ur users Myst@@ ical Monkey , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ Multiple photos of the incident form the gray @-@ full scenes of this day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
above is an example .
it shows rows of carbon@@ ized bodies that can sleep on the ground during people .
but here the story does not find her end .
over the years the same photo was canc@@ eled several times on social media , blo@@ gs and other platforms , however , however , however , however , however , were not to be attributed to the necessary trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on January 3 , 2015 , fighters of the B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the ent@@ le@@ gen@@ ic settlements Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
Aug@@ enz@@ eu@@ es reported dra@@ stically from cru@@ ises to whom they had to flee .
houses and shops were burnt down and dead bodies in streets and bones .
there were reports that 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the numbers could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one remained back to number dead bodies , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a inhabitants to Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many were z@@ ew@@ ed , shot , or burned .
only from satellite images the following time could be shown .
the reason for the attack was also un@@ explained , but the army of army in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt to win Har@@ am to win country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture from the DR Kongo returned to , when it was noted for the fact and the possible extent of the attack was presented :
that is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , these ab@@ usi@@ ve use of the picture from the DR Kongo is only one in a number of failure ; Africa Check has documented orders to Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases the picture was brought as a letter for mass@@ ages .
another step further bring personal comments such as this example f@@ law@@ ed the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to supply arguments .
the painting also occurred in conjunction with the fatal persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a flash message , published by the United Nations those who were able to flee , rape and some dead , some of them are burning .
while others reported by violence against Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Post@@ s like the following that these descriptions were merged with photos from the DR Congo :
this picture comes from a Saudi Arabia &apos;s news page , which had claimed 2012 , the President My@@ an@@ m@@ ars Th@@ ein had said , mon@@ ks and polit@@ ician would have been involved in the assassination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image from the DR Kongo to present these information .
the original contribution to the last one was accessed on April 26 , 2017 , can be called here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other news organisations , AFP , as their source , had also been mad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they had not tried this statement out of the DR Kongo . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the worldwide range of false information
traces of this false c@@ ash@@ ings go back to the years 2011 and 2012 and actually comes from anywhere in the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; using a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reverse image search &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can see how far more information can be exceeded . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a converted image search for the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 344 pictures below 18.@@ 8 billion images ( as of 3 May 2017 ) 344 pictures , which are very similar to the said image from the DR Congo .
they origin@@ ate from a mixed mask private pages , platforms of social media and Community and national publications and are in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have wrong reports to be released , others tries to expos@@ e for@@ geri@@ es to f@@ eit .
we have found examples of ab@@ norm@@ ality use and associated them with the respective countries , based on what site they were published on which side they were published . this way , we want to represent the reach of the language only by language alone .

this post , dedicated to the members of the Russian Orthodox Church , reveals that the image of the DR Kongo does NOT present Muslims who kill Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news page claimed that the President of Myanmar Th@@ ein was one of His 2012 , mon@@ ks and politicians have been involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story with the image from S@@ ange together .
the article was updated in 2014 and currently contain the picture of this release .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article by 2014 about students who had been updated by B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the Catholic near news An@@ Ã¡@@ l@@ is@@ is Digital , has expressly declared that the image is not taken by the red@@ oms , but it claims that it was a &quot; similar d@@ ag@@ ic attack . &quot;
as the picture later , in connection with the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am , in circulation by 2015 , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to contra@@ di@@ ct it connections to Nigeria .
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Y@@ an@@ Ä±@@ y@@ or@@ y@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria bur@@ ns that sleeps the world ) .
the picture of the DR Kongo appeared , provided with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and dissolved a discussion under Muslims after the massacres of the B@@ oko Har@@ im 2015 and the stop on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted to achieve that their communities found this events that were suspected in the name of the Islam@@ s , a major attention .
United States , 2015 .
the picture was wit@@ ched as a letter for the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am in 2015 ( and more than 9.@@ 300 times a ret@@ we@@ et ) . but the messages that were associated with it were taken in no religious context .
instead , the goal was to judge attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of media reporting in comparison between Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( Maltese ) , 2014 .
after a message having been written by a &quot; P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mart@@ os &quot; on the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , in circulation , discussion for@@ ums such as this here on Vietnamese and declared it to a false message .
from the message that was contained in the DR Kongo on , the organization of Clar@@ et@@ iner mission@@ aries and P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mart@@ os .
there is further confirmed examples of in@@ correct use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
at other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and pages in the following countries ( on the folder in grey ) , Tin@@ Eye also exhibits are not fully tra@@ ce@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , the Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with UR@@ Ls and time / data post@@ mark exist on the Web@@ cra@@ wler and have some image data in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , the image has been published just after the original accident of 2010 , the figure was probably a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
frames and images
there are two strong subjects or frames ( ir@@ radiation ) that go through these postal . the first frame is focused on religion .
the photo was used in relation to greater discussions about silence in the context of Christians through Muslims or - for the defence of Muslims - the murder of cru@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hist@@ s .
a second Fr@@ aming was used to discuss how an African life is given in comparison to a European or French life .
religion understand and the value of human life is both important . therefore it &apos;s worth to investigate how to be used in connection with these efforts .
however , a deeper question is however , what happens if reading these pictures cannot be made longer faith .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with social media , there are people who are un@@ intended to exercise the water round about a tragedy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sug@@ od@@ ds this mood of the false and false information that actual cru@@ ises are un@@ true and tast@@ es of what actually happened in the DR Kongo , Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the preval@@ ence pictures has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
an argument is that the retention of images of a ref@@ usal comes to detect the tragedy . sometimes , these pictures will even be demanded by the victims .

a blog with the name Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ er@@ able ( e.g. in@@ ex@@ changeable ) , language thr@@ illed a selection of words from around the world that are difficult or not to translate .
such words are in each language : you press certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these unnecessary words are already well @-@ known ( like the famous Portuguese acid ) and others , which are deeply ro@@ oted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish s@@ lows ) .
but all contra@@ diction persistent every attempt of a simple translation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a word or expression &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not enough to understand why a full explanation and sometimes a little context is necessary to understand what is meant with this one word . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these unique words were collected for a whole time in an online list .
most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , during the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird , decided to concentrate on small languages .
in the blog you can find words from the VAT of V@@ anu@@ at@@ u as follows :
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - En@@ sur@@ ing your parents in recognition of how to have ende@@ av@@ oured in your younger years .
words and words in the H@@ uns@@ ric language that are spoken in parts of Brazil , as :
&quot; kw@@ adi &quot; - The convenience or sl@@ oth , which one feels , after being w@@ asted in cold days in the sun .
in your own words from his blog :
it grin@@ ders to other cultures , un@@ veil other thought @-@ length and we@@ aves our cur@@ i@@ osity .
sometimes , as we influence the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page would like to show more of these &quot; un@@ re@@ plac@@ eable &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Red@@ ner &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Treasure Languages &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which are appreciated by Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ er@@ als are invited to download their favorite words here . &quot; &quot; &quot;

like Sri Lanka with the worst flood disaster of the decade
the island of Sri Lanka is currently the worst flood flood disaster in this decade to this decade .
triggered by the sun , usually in late May , the rivers of Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ alu O@@ ya entered the south and west of the country on the shore .
according to the opinion of the cat@@ ast@@ roph@@ ic center of Sri Lanka , 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and almost hundreds of people are missing because of the floods and slaughter win@@ ches .
more than 400 000 people have been affected since the last Friday ( 26 May ) and approximately 100 000 people were brought into 304 safe stay .
the ra@@ ins were left off on Saturday ( May 27 ) , and the water resi@@ stances in some areas went slowly .
health and hygienic conditions of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected area and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following images and videos give an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :
flood water in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water levels of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am Ame@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et provide regular updates to the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the disaster .
Sri Lanka &apos;s fatal river killing the den@@ oun@@ cing crisis , Save the Children , after other ra@@ ins are already on the road .
today , the Nel@@ u@@ wa bus stood in the flood , water level up to 6 meters . village Mor@@ ago@@ da at G@@ all also over@@ flow@@ ed because of the yesterday over@@ flowing water p@@ eg@@ ist of Mor@@ og@@ oda El@@ a .
the air force has five aircraft for rescue actions and further five are made to transport of emergency deliveries to those who were finished in their over@@ flow@@ ed villages .
also different organizations and start@@ ups have prepared themselves to help .
Facebook pages like Help Flo@@ od V@@ IC@@ TI@@ MS in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka deliver important information about flood situation and humanitarian aid .
if any search and lif@@ egu@@ ards are required for their operations , please call the number 07@@ 7@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 .
for everyone who want to don@@ ate the dry food and food required for flood victims -
we are today in the region around Kel@@ en@@ i@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call the number 07@@ 77@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 07@@ 77@@ 84@@ 38@@ 41 , if animals need help in this area .
the tax@@ ir@@ u@@ f @-@ App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their s@@ iting data with the help of the app , so that the Cat@@ ast@@ oph@@ enz@@ entrum is informed .
last year after the disaster of the tropical storm Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ ups led a &quot; high water relief &quot; button , which allowed it to pick up a vehicle to pick up a vehicle to pick up from help of help and donations . these were then forwarded to the sr@@ il@@ an@@ ical Red Cross .
as well , they led a &quot; S@@ OS &quot; button , which had more than thousand requests and 150 successful boat trip through flood water and path@@ o@@ aches to the result .
the agreed efforts of the government and civil population of Sri Lanka , where several social media platforms will be fully exhau@@ sted , the inhabitants live in distress and aff@@ ord the help of Hil@@ fem@@ otion .
this has prevented the loss of other lives , with the population of Sri Lanka is the long way to restore the standardi@@ zation .
Muslims who can &apos;t see
the Women &apos;s March on 21st of January 2017 in San Francisco .
photo of Sah@@ ar Hab@@ ib G@@ ha@@ zi .
use approved t.@@ Dam@@ as in January I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neigh@@ bor and love gir@@ l@@ friend .
I trust her four years old daughter , she tru@@ sts me her children ; she is my rock in a surf .
in one minute , we call for the rights of women .
in the next post we add rights to trans@@ gender .
we are located in a sea of rain@@ umbre@@ l@@ las and people , some hold the iconic picture of a woman with a towel , bound up from an American flag , other sk@@ ili@@ ating slo@@ gan@@ s against Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my gir@@ l@@ friend look at me , saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things do not concern thee ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslim ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I already led this conversation .
people , with whom I work or people who have been working for me since years , split me - the Sah@@ ar that they know - of the widespread concept by &quot; Muslims &quot; which has been built in their performance .
she con@@ domin@@ ate me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims around the world .
we don &apos;t see all equal .
we are practi@@ cing our religion .
we identify ourselves to be a Muslim , in different art . but som@@ eh@@ ow we are all plug@@ ged in the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is well constructed in our collective idea that as soon as Muslims who do not custom@@ ize it there .
dis@@ mis@@ ed mus@@ li@@ zed
I don &apos;t stand alone .
that &apos;s even the poet , whose poetry is sold in America : Rum@@ i .
which images are in the sense when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
as Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was a orthodo@@ x mus@@ li@@ ous pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Kor@@ an and Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died , the center of his poetry .
but in the western idea , it &apos;s deleted by religion Roman@@ is , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry .
this del@@ etion makes a major part of the history of 1.7 billion Muslims from this world .
another consists in the induc@@ tive images of Muslims who have been colonial by the Western books since centuries .
this cur@@ ri@@ ving educational language is determined by the dark men whom you should fear and the exotic woman that should be saved .
the pione@@ ering Palestinian scientist Edward S@@ aid dismant@@ led the history behind these pictures in the 1970s .
but these pictures also continued today .
they continued our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood .
I worked in the News industry for thirteen years and I have seen how this powerful , faul@@ ty nar@@ r@@ ative of our news@@ feeds domin@@ ate .
this Nar@@ rati@@ v over@@ sh@@ adows the reality that brought out nine Muslim women in the last three decades , while the US could not take their first female presidential candidate in 2016 .
this Nar@@ rati@@ v f@@ ails to recogn@@ ise that if French , Muslim women are forced to carry out their heads in public buildings and forced to cover their whole body to cover their entire body , which both are both sides of the same medal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a powerful group exercis@@ ed his &quot; control &quot; to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this strong nar@@ rati@@ ate Muslim women who perform movements for change .
in addition , it sees that the first Muslim prayers of Afri@@ cans were spoken by Afri@@ kan@@ ers who had been brought with slaves .
it del@@ etes the existence of Que@@ er Muslims .
this Nar@@ rati@@ v has occupied our collective strength , deeply and in@@ accurate , that often Sik@@ h @-@ men and children are to become an@@ tim@@ us@@ ous attacks and hy@@ ik@@ an@@ ings .
due to these stories , which we tell and because of the kind , in which we tell them , Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia is not only fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; others . &quot;
the 1.7 billion belong
in the News industry we can do more than just stories , which are based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create Nar@@ r@@ ative that help us to understand the world .
and my industry is confident that the Nar@@ rati@@ v capture the 1.7 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we are confident that seven million Muslims comprise the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Relig@@ ious &quot; Relig@@ ious group in America &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than one @-@ third of the entire Muslim population are African Americans .
six of the ten American Muslims belong to the immigrants in the first generation that origin@@ ate from 77 countries .

at that time , when Khan thought the Sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were un@@ disputed Muslims and Americans .
but am I in@@ overcome Muslims and American ?
sometimes , if people ask me why I don &apos;t ask Schwein@@ furt , I say - instead of my Muslim recipes or bring my hand@@ ker@@ ch@@ iefs , who bear all Muslims - &quot; from respect of P@@ epp@@ a W@@ utz . &quot;
I sh@@ ear , we don &apos;t wear all pocket with us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also need to be a the@@ ological experts to be &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be selected or almost always for additional security checks at the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim schol@@ ars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists who had to fight against Islam .
these lies are produced by a well @-@ ador@@ ned Islam@@ ists , thy@@ roid , thy@@ roid , and experts for Fal@@ con information , which is a Muslim image , which is a Muslim ; or what Islam is , manip@@ ulated .
due to the stories , which we tell and because of the kind , in which we tell them , Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia is in more than just a stranger that ri@@ pping the head cloth .

I want to explain that .
I was born in the Muslim but a Muslim Brotherhood , when I was four years old when I was four years old , in a provisional mosque in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
if social scientist describe religious life , they attack on the following terms : faith , behavi@@ ors , and conc@@ iliation .
my mus@@ li@@ ous faith and behavior are not always visible , but they are there .
perhaps my gir@@ l@@ friend would see my neigh@@ bor , my rock in bran@@ ding , that I am Muslim , when they see through 15 meters of concrete and air that can separate our houses .
she would see the all@@ end@@ ous rit@@ ual with my daughter if I destroy them in my arms and her Arab verses to protect the Kor@@ an , the Kor@@ an and the Q@@ ul@@ s are called .
I repeat three times each of them .
I pray you , that they are protected from evil , evil , which can be seen and evil that can &apos;t see .
my mus@@ li@@ ous faith is possibly not visible , but my Muslim citizenship is always part of my shadow .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; citizenship means to grow up and hear that men should not weep , but at the same time , that my father mour@@ ned great father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of the modern Islam and over the independence K@@ ash@@ mir@@ s , N@@ ana J@@ aan , wept around his family in a half century , he who didn &apos;t close his arms in half a century .
citizenship is to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians whose families were torn apart from col@@ oni@@ alists , who have divided the Muslim world as at the game risk .
Muslims to be known that in the last two centuries Europeans do all have been colon@@ ized on four Muslim countries . &quot;

it means that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is buried beneath the war .
an American Muslim Brotherhood means that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 per cent since 2001 .
it means to know that if there is a tragedy in the USA , and the susp@@ ects that carries a Muslim name , the history of four times will be reported as a story with a white attacks .
it means to know that forty @-@ hundred years ago the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , who was called Bil@@ al , was called Bil@@ al .

it is the warmth that I feel , when people over@@ crow@@ ded the airports to fight against the Muslim Ban .

to be a mother , signi@@ fies me to ensure my child and all Muslim children , well knowing that ma@@ cht@@ ful and privileg@@ ed persons on this double @-@ structural Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia .
structural Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia is established in the Muslim regist@@ ering , who started with President Bush and extended under President Obama .
it is in continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it exists in the emig@@ rant officials who takes a five year old child in handic@@ raft .
it is in a country that bom@@ bed its borders against people from just the countries who bom@@ bed it .
it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; no @-@ Fly list , &quot; which takes its largely Arab@@ s and Muslims .
there are wars that we perform and destroy the bombs , which we cast on Muslim countries .
due to the stories that we tell and due to them whom we don &apos;t tell , we are here .
in a study with Asc@@ ent of Man , scientists of North@@ western University participants showed a scientifically proven image and desired them to judge groups on a scale from 1 to 100 regarding evolution .
Muslims received the lowest points .
the conversation , which we must lead
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are too deep to ab@@ stain the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are decades back to detect the roots of our fears and the faul@@ ty and dangerous expres@@ sive prints , which we inter@@ sec@@ ted in our news editors .
at least , there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims within the media industry , which tries to capture our much with connec@@ tive ident@@ ities and forgotten history .

but I am concerned about this difficult global newspaper point in which we are located .
and at this moment the consequences have to go out more than 1.7 billion .
there is a reason that con@@ spiracy the@@ or@@ ists existed in the dark corners of the Internet , now the White House now lead .
they are exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally grown , because they did Muslims . &quot;
there is another group that has been exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally grown , by making the &quot; others &quot; created . &quot;
a few years ago it had not yet been given it ; now they rule over great territories in Syria and Iraq .
I am concerned about the re@@ alities and the history , which I was not aware of it when I was old now my daughter , but those who have made me today to become an un@@ converted Muslim .
things I have left here like a bread scratch track in my speech .
things you may we@@ aken the memories , because in all the inter@@ sec@@ ctions , which makes our humanity , may one story is l@@ ur@@ king , where someone is made to one &quot; others . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must do ourselves un@@ comfortable questions after the role of its , consci@@ ously and I dis@@ solves the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it is a new future , in which we bom@@ bed a new future while he had already bom@@ bed the countries and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; being bom@@ bed , far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for nar@@ r@@ ative art wants to preserve urban lingu@@ istic variety
history of history include Fli@@ ck@@ r users Daniele Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be a possibility to enter here and now despite a language barrier to someone with someone ?
Steven Bird and Ro@@ by@@ n Perry , founder of the initiative Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling ( T@@ LS ) is the number of stories in their original language a possible response .
global Vo@@ ices reported a short initiative by Steven Bird , the Un@@ negoti@@ able blog .
however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to obtain the language variety of great cities and to dig@@ iti@@ ate .
in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in Oak@@ land , where T@@ LS has already been carried out since 2015 , the risk that small and not so small languages are not given to the sole born babies .
for the makers of the project :
the mass mortality of the world can be avoided , if we are cities , we accept cities - safe spaces , in which inhabitants are not forgotten , who are to be da@@ zz@@ ling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hearing are often connected to understand &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these events instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to feel good to feel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format , stor@@ yt@@ ellers set their history first in their own language and translate or explain it in English .
even if the participants are no professional stor@@ yt@@ ellers , their dev@@ otion , and their presentation , we carry out the hearing aid .
they call laughter and emot@@ ions , when the language is no longer a barrier .
for example , the following video shows a traditional story from Burkina Faso , which is told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the stor@@ yt@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou also attacks the opportunity to explain their country of typical customs of knowledge .
in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the move from the bun@@ ni@@ es and the P@@ abo@@ und in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
after having declared the importance of his F@@ ak , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is this to speak to an audience what your language does not understand ? &quot; with a broad gr@@ in@@ sen he divi@@ des his feeling of in@@ si@@ vity :
they have heard !
they were atten@@ tive ...
they were all with me !
so far , the events of Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling have taken place in three cities , and the organ@@ izers hope to expand this . all those who are inspired by the project can come into contact with T@@ LS in order to organize their own stor@@ yt@@ ellers .
Puerto Rico calls for the US re@@ en@@ forcement of state debt
the aim of a re @-@ audit of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which took over 72 million US dollars , participated in the capital building of the capital , and ran until the Plaza de Col@@ Ã³n in the old town of San Ju@@ ans .
then she was proclaimed by the group &quot; Fr@@ ente Ci@@ ud@@ ad@@ ano p@@ or la Audit@@ or@@ Ã­a de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( civil Front for the Neur@@ ath of Deb@@ t ) and the E@@ kom@@ en@@ ical Church of Puerto Ric@@ os .
the advoc@@ acy of the new debt was also submitted to the official website of the White House of the United States .
this is your demand :
the people of Puerto R@@ s demands that the politicians , banks and government agencies that are responsible for the debt , responsible for their corruption .
we call for a financial examination and a cable committee without personal interests in public debt , with a firm to re@@ mun@@ eration our working conditions , which is in favour of the economy .
we will be de@@ pressed and supp@@ ressed .
the people of Puerto Ric@@ os refused to pay a debt that is not her .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pension@@ ers will not be found with sin@@ king pension payments .
we demand instant measures .
the island - not in the international territory of the United States - suffer from a severe financial crisis .
thus , the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ profit non @-@ profit organization with focus on soci@@ o@@ economic development , a law for state responsibility , as an alternative to existing state view .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis Puerto Ric@@ os requires a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the outside , the measures shall not run without the participation and convic@@ tions of citizens , to be rejected by the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the demonstration took the name of &quot; night watch for light and truth . &quot;

activists , artists , designers , developer , researchers and authors who have involved in the movements of Free knowledge , page have worked on page to create about the ne@@ b@@ ula who gives us to create our news@@ feeds and to create something sense from our various experiences .
this book is an attempt to liber@@ ate Bas@@ le Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , beloved and celebrated Internet volunteers , who has been detained in Syria since 15 March 2012 .
his name was cancelled from the list of A@@ dra prison in which he sat on 3 October 2015 .
since then we have no information about his current state or residence .
the introductory part of his book with the title Collec@@ tive memory gives his friends and his family a voice that want to release on his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom .
to see how Bas@@ sel has a high price for his participation in a free culture , has many of us to start thinking about their own dest@@ in@@ ies , acts and decisions .
why Are We Here ?
what have we decided ?
what have we abandoned in this process by means of extreme belie@@ fs ?
the Web developer for open source and digital activ@@ ist has been in custody of Syrian government agencies since March 2012 .
in October 2015 Bas@@ sel was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution , transferred to an unknown location .
his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi , reported that the &quot; Military Police Bas@@ sel reported on the basis of a &quot; strictly prohibited &quot; held command from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
G@@ ha@@ zi reported that it was cont@@ acted on 12 November 2015 by people who were presented itself as the in@@ sider of the Assad government and set them out of a alleged death sentence against her husband .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his residence and state remains unknown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , played a crucial role in it to expand access to the Internet and to know about public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , Techn@@ ologist , and currently crossing the head of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bas@@ sel , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps there was none of the Bass@@ els cultural prototypes as the work that he began with a group of archae@@ ologist and 3D artists around 2005 to recon@@ struct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ m@@ yr@@ as .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites of the world , was the way of numerous civ@@ il@@ izations , and melt Greek @-@ Roman architecture types with hi@@ es@@ ful traditions and personal influences .
Bas@@ sel could not know that ten years after he began working with this work , the IS would make everything that architecture , which em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world .
this stamp to the digital archae@@ ology and the conservation has created a time capsule created for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future of un@@ inv@@ alu@@ able value .
typically , Bas@@ sel could not close this project before .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I have spent my whole life to dream and dream , and he taught me to slay them .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bas@@ sel brought me in English , even when he was already in custody .
I learned to read in English , I have learned to write and speak English .
he always has always shared his knowledge with every one that has asked . he has taught others to read English , to write and speak English .
Bas@@ sel opened my gate to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
he also taught others , as they use computer , at least theore@@ tically , without knowing in their hands .
G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( waiting ) , a trial which she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 , when he was in custody .
Bas@@ sel and N@@ our@@ a have worked together in the book for a year .
they tast@@ es the lyrics of him , when they visited him , and translated them from the Arab in English .
the book is licensed free .

here is an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a with the title &quot; It happens &quot; :
it happens in every visit ,
that I sin@@ sin@@ ke in the world of your ench@@ anting eyes ,
that I left the better thing in the moment , in which we embra@@ ced us ,
that every of the dangers is no matter ,
everyone of the f@@ ences , bo@@ ilers and gu@@ ardi@@ ans
I forget the pris@@ ets of the prison
and I go in every detail of your voice and words .
I carry you with passion for me ,
when your eyes are void
and I will send another piece of my soul with you ...
I return to my lon@@ el@@ iness ,
to recover all the moments ,
and talk about your absence , and smile .
I create myself , that I will return soon ...
G@@ ha@@ zi wrote on the first anniversary of the Order of Bas@@ sel :
a year is , my soul
during and during
I am in your cage ,
and you are still in the cage of monsters
Bass@@ els History is not unique in Syria .
according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) , since the beginning of protests in 2011 , they have disappeared more than 65@@ ,000 people .
those who were arrested or were imprisoned by the regime , were tor@@ tured or executed by the regime .
according to the international human rights organization Am@@ nesty International has died at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians in prison since 2011 .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices Community demands the release of Bas@@ sel since 2012 .
we repeat our claim in hope that we must do this for the last time .
Mos@@ ambique : due to corruption Ver@@ ur@@ ge director after adher@@ ence to previous post .
Mozambique responded with anger on a corruption of corruption in which a government member returned to the workplace in the state of state , which was committed to corruption .
this is the Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza , who was arrested in 2008 and joined together with four other accused of 54 million met@@ ic@@ al ( roughly 800 000 Euro ) for 22 years imprisonment .
the money origin@@ ates from public funds in the airports of Mozambique , their council Cam@@ b@@ aza between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ b@@ aza was released in 2016 for good leadership and immediately requested his return to the company what happened on April 19 .
in accordance with a statement by the General Pro@@ sec@@ ution of the Republic , there was no obst@@ acle course for Cam@@ b@@ aza , returned to his old post as the company moved a discipl@@ in@@ arian method after his imprisonment .
however , many inhabitants are not hot .
the Centre of Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Bu@@ da@@ de P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lica , shortly C@@ IP ) , a local institution that sets themselves to public transparency , condemned in an interview with the German wave decision of the company to re@@ locate the director :
represents a set@@ backs in the fight against corruption and clari@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a step in regard to the efforts of our legal system , so the C@@ IP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what we regard to knowledge , the company also should have a discipl@@ in@@ able process against the resi@@ stances . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company looks silent , but does not affect adequate legal steps for the use of the respective functions .
Eg@@ Ã­@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Mos@@ ambique social media , ref@@ uses this behaviour as well as &quot; contra@@ diction &quot; :
when Cam@@ b@@ aza was a competent type , he would have been a consultant after having been sentenced to a prison sentence and had to eat half .
he could pay paid talks and motiv@@ ating spe@@ eches , he could advise and his image polishing .
but since he is un@@ competent , he has refused to be re@@ integrated into the company which he helped his damage .
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ aza will be paid for his silence .
contra@@ diction !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil says the director does not include any Mor@@ al :
Cam@@ b@@ aza from the state to be rewarded , because he doesn &apos;t believe him , could not believe someone this way that the state has already under@@ gone massi@@ vely .
Cam@@ b@@ aza is missing the Mor@@ al to serve and serve the state , * he already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead of being operated on the state instead .
Cam@@ b@@ aza was used to state the state as handy for an in@@ exhau@@ st@@ ible money source and the state itself , this man was tired , the pre @-@ loaded and finally was sentenced to a long prison sentence .
hon@@ est@@ ly I don &apos;t know why this man was rewarded .
Fran@@ ce@@ y Ze@@ Ãº@@ te is preferred to remember the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , remember that a thief has been in prison :
th@@ ieves do not belong to the prison of Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , the Mozambique will not only remain forever as the first independent president , but also as a sharp , sl@@ itting and - by saying , prophet@@ ical Red@@ ner .
one of his most illustri@@ ous represent@@ ations was , as he confirmed that &quot; an ambitious man is able to sell his amb@@ itions for his amb@@ itions , to sell his own individual interest . &quot;
Sam@@ ora said : &quot; I don &apos;t know if a ambitious man changes , my experience shows that it is not so . he changes the tac@@ tic , but he turns not from his amb@@ itions .
an ambitious man is criminal crimin@@ ally . &quot;
in Twitter the reactions were also le@@ aning :
Cam@@ b@@ aza was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he sat down for 10 years and came free .
and today , the company reli@@ es on him the company , with which he had Gel@@ der , again under contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ OM@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - Refle@@ ction of God ( @ az@@ mal _ Raf@@ ik ) 12 May 2017
Em@@ ild@@ o Sam@@ bo from the magazine @ ver@@ da@@ de ( to German : @ truth ) states that crime in Mozambique is paid :
indeed , in # Mos@@ ambi@@ k thief and ministers of the # Fre@@ lim@@ o is paying off . # Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza , for long time imprisonment , returns to # airports of Mozambique - Em@@ ild@@ o Sam@@ bo ( @ Em@@ ild@@ o@@ Sam@@ bo ) 11 May 2017
Facebook blo@@ cked the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cen@@ sored many users
the Bur@@ m@@ ical word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means chick@@ pe@@ a or sk@@ iers .

according to information from Facebook users in Myanmar , the known social network took their postal from the net because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although the source of the word is still discussed , it is normally used to refer to humans in Indian origin or in general as ad@@ jective &quot; In@@ disch . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or belief , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( in Bur@@ m@@ ical Scrip@@ tures ) as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of the Hass@@ elt in Burma in the social network . &quot; &quot; &quot;
during the past few years , the ascent of radical nation@@ alist movements has given an extremely ab@@ dom@@ ination K@@ onn@@ ot@@ ation .
in particular , it is a word that usually used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists in Hass@@ elt against Muslims who represent a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in the effort to fight against Hass@@ elt in Myanmar , the company has made a lot of sen@@ su@@ ed content on its platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos;s are normally to be associated with rac@@ ism , but the word on itself is not calling for Hass@@ elt .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that , in which they discussed the use of the Word , or doub@@ ts to the use of his use , were cen@@ sored .
in addition there are several bur@@ mes@@ ic words with basic mean@@ ings that have the same book sequence such as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , chair at Bur@@ m@@ ese also wrote &apos; Kal@@ ar ht@@ a@@ ing &apos; written what the same letter contains , as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ar@@ ka@@ ar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ king A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the various mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post of my friends was deleted today because he contained the Word Kal@@ ar .
however , he had asked his friends on the spiritual way if it could we@@ ave how he could lin@@ t his back pain , saying a word game .
the set ku la - &quot; healing &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) to Bur@@ m@@ ese - resem@@ bles the rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different .
there were several reactions to the Facebook initiative .
Z@@ in Win is the opinion that she will reduce Hass@@ elt ra@@ dic@@ aler nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook analy@@ tic would be able to spread out all the Post@@ s , which in suspic@@ ion hours , rac@@ ism .
Facebook del@@ etes the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; not manually .
it turns the word automatically .
the Autom@@ ism will not understand what you are writing to Fac@@ eb@@ ook .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what it should make instead , the post is carefully analy@@ ze and check it by using the same words . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar Ht@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; ( age age ) .
the good thing is that this three @-@ piece nation@@ alists will spread the Hass@@ elt , a rather good lesson .
now it is time to circum@@ cise their nation@@ alism .
while the action plan to send a strong signal to all of the Hass@@ elt , the efficiency of this strategy is not able to keep the efficiency of this strategy .
the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ chat have proven that the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of impact often are often going to start with social networks , a new word or an alternative writing of the cen@@ sored word to express their views .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described as Facebook began to delete his postal , when he would only express his friends , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &apos; is ex@@ iled by the social network : &quot; &quot; &quot;
... when I was atten@@ tive to this new directive on Facebook , I made a post to inform my Facebook friends that the Word is closed .
ir@@ on@@ ically , my post office was removed from Facebook and it became li@@ ken , post and parts of content for 24 hours , because the post &quot; fac@@ tual community does not cause the &quot; Facebook community standards . &quot;
Facebook has a number of posters removed from people who have no negative inten@@ tions or simply try to show their opinions against Hass@@ elt radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed , who has nothing to do with Hass@@ elt :
post without Hass@@ ell from Facebook .
in the post , the author divided his opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism are evil in the country .
Chan My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have been doing more before the beginning of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community asking advice :
Facebook may have a charity intention to reduce rac@@ ism in Burma by its platform , but it does not work .
such words can be used only more hat@@ red within the different communities .
in addition , it seems to have this without any local context or technical support , and have banned the words like &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; pe@@ an@@ curr@@ y &quot; .
even when they found out that they did not handle errors , they tried to report the f@@ eit@@ ed postal post@@ s .
if they only have somewhat more respect for the 15 million benefit , they had a great turnover that would be great .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fac@@ eb@@ ooks automatic c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship has provided users for much sp@@ lic@@ ally among users . &quot; &quot; &quot;
instead of making it , users now make Facebook funny and write the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &apos;s &quot; not in the context of Hass@@ elt to see whether their postal order will be taken from the net .
here you can see some screen@@ shots from Facebook @-@ Post@@ s , which contains no Hass@@ elt , but nevertheless removed :

over the past five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious Fund@@ ament@@ alists , social networks have used to expand their voices and their influence .
among other things the violence in social networks are in addition to heat the violence in the municipalities in Myanmar , especially in Rak@@ h@@ ine territory , where disputes between Muslims and Budd@@ hist@@ s have forced thousands to escape .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised for his failure who critic@@ ises the Hass@@ elt on his bur@@ s@@ mes@@ ian pages under control .
but rather rather than simply the word &apos; lime &apos; , it would have been better to focus on context as a code @-@ concentrated initiatives and learned from them .
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tobago is conclu@@ de with the children before
a wedding ring in the sand .
photo of Der@@ ek Gav@@ ey , CC B@@ Y 2.0 .
the nur@@ ser@@ y is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago now .
on 9 June 2017 , the State of the country unanimously decided to offer a law which should offer this practice , so that the married age is now at 18 .
before this change of the sp@@ ouses held on the practice , and in May 2016 , brother Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ad Mah@@ ar@@ aj was gathered to a group of representatives of the various religious groups that the state did not inter@@ f@@ ere there , that the state does not inter@@ f@@ ere there , age not the maturity . &quot;
this happened on the fact that Trinidad and Tobago has been a contractual partner of the UN child Convention on Human Rights , defined by min@@ ors than , every man under 18 years . &quot;
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children who had already been married in Trinidad and Tobago 2.8 percent , and with 18 were 8.1 percent .
in 2011 the statistical Central Office of the country confirmed that of 1997 @-@ 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married to 19 married .
online pet@@ itions and social media movements , which were con@@ tested , laws for children before they followed , followed by the foot and rejoiced with great support . und@@ ou@@ b@@ tedly , they will test the result .
nevertheless , not everything was smooth .
a Hin@@ du @-@ guides , for example had no concerns to say the critics of the children before , they should not take care of their own matters . &quot;
this kind of religious opposition sor@@ row@@ ed for ten@@ sions in this actually un@@ complicated matter , and sometime there were doub@@ ts whether the opposition would agree to the bill .
but at the beginning of 2017 , the bill was decided against the child before - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent , which was discussed at the House of Represent@@ atives , where he would already make a simple majority to the law .
now only the president of the country must vote and declare the law .
one of the country &apos;s broadcasting gave to Facebook a status update which Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ agra@@ m :
Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence R@@ amb@@ har@@ at : the bill against child before was decided in the House of Represent@@ atives , with 35 votes and no one .
after prior to the Senate , the draft can now be made to the law .
the majority of social media users were thr@@ illed because the laws of the children were finally changed .
Facebook @-@ member Lov@@ ell Francis , who came to the Ministry of Education in the Ministry of Education , said :
it has too much time and unnecessary odo@@ ede , which has veil@@ ed the core of the thing , but know what ? the child before is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago now , and this is almost every price .
while Abel Jackson &apos;s opinion , it was definitely enough to complete the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas survived that the day was finally arrived :
public status update on Facebook from L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which follows : , , Excellent news !
the Eh@@ eg@@ es@@ etz has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for it - 0 others ! ! ! !
fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , who belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( W@@ I@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society group which was right openly , said , as important the adoption of the law , noted :
the married age in Trinidad and Tobago is now independent of the religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
the draft on the change of marriage was approved today , on June 9 , 2017 .
there were 41 members in the House of Represent@@ atives , 35 dep@@ uties and 35 were present at the voting .
all members who were against , have agreed to the law .
the child before has been legally allowed in Trinidad and Tobago .
it was a long struggle ( ... ) # child@@ r@@ age@@ isch@@ s@@ ild@@ .
many thanks to all activ@@ ist who took him out .
congratulations to all .
a Dan@@ ke to our M@@ EP@@ s .
however , a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Mah@@ ar@@ aj , the Secretary @-@ General of San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hin@@ du @-@ organization of the country .
prior to months , Mah@@ ar@@ aj hasn &apos;t announced his intention to conduct judicial steps , should the law be adopted , and he seems to redeem his promise .
during the General Pro@@ curator Paris Al ra@@ wi , a disc@@ ol@@ ate of the law , said it is definitely just@@ ly , if Mah@@ ar@@ aj would like to set up the law , the most social media users , one would have different the discussion on the subject .
Patri@@ cia Wor@@ rell :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dear Sat , if we could speak instead of the discussion , in a way that we could speak instead of big , hard @-@ hard men who are against them in the advantage &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be dis@@ mis@@ used , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be ready to continue the discussion ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
or do you believe it is not a problem ?
but if there is a judicial proceedings against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - but there are still places in the world where the children are legal in different gra@@ d@@ ations , or still the norm although there are laws , which they say .

thanks to the mirror of websites , Turkish users can view Wikipedia content back
the English @-@ speaking Wikipedia page was presented on January 18 , 2012 , in addition to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IPA copyright laws in the USA , internationally suspected .
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
for more than one month , Turkey has now closed the popular and on the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based en@@ cyclo@@ pe@@ dia .
day for Tag is clear how important the platform for users can be found to find helpful and reliable information .
students as well as repor@@ ters and fans of TV series are against the blocking .
although many technicians are used , changing tools for blo@@ cked websites ( a current article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has not seen the third largest VPN pre@@ val@@ ence in the world ) , most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has been closed since 2008 in a published report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University has been held , regular block@@ ings of the internet has been adopted since 2007 after the Internet Act ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after China , Turkey is the most famous land of the world , if it goes around the massive c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of Wikipedia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the platform remains closed , several Mir@@ ror pages ( pages which are reflected the content of Wikipedia and often updated ) .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform laid down all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centr@@ alized Peer @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network ( so computer calcul@@ ator ) , which is not based on the system of domain name and thus makes a complete c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the content is activated despite the prohibition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a B@@ log@@ mail report IP@@ FS reported about his efforts :
after we have heard the messages ( over the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we were able to put snap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . the possibility to read the content on de@@ centr@@ alized and distributed ways .
this can help users to see at least all Wikipedia content , even if it can not reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pe@@ y.@@ org .
IP@@ FS also provided that this step is independent of the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it was merely a screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wik@@ im@@ edia was involved in other effort to handle the sperm .

one attacks on another URL , which is not the original . that what you see , is from Wikipedia .
essentially , the server leads the request to the right Wikipedia page , so it is possible to see the content of Wikipedia itself when they are blo@@ cked in Turkey .

S@@ ascha Gir@@ i was with the photos that he looked around , never satisfied . they were w@@ ished with po@@ or@@ ly positioned moti@@ fs and balanced colors .
that motiv@@ ated him to wear a camera with themselves and try to gra@@ b the situation .
at that time he was still a child .
today , at the age of 28 , S@@ USS is trying to bring Nep@@ als , Nep@@ als wildlife to the international stage .
and his home town next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos , which guides the attention to Nep@@ als wildlife .
described on Facebook as he described this first class location with his work :
I live at the edge of the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world heritage . what could it be better for a passionate game of wildlife ! !
I felt right at home when I suddenly called Navar@@ aj ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) . he had received a call from my father to be on the bank of the Rap@@ ti river on the bank of the Rap@@ ti river .
the river dam@@ m is only a few minutes away from the tourist village Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I was running with my camera and was there in few minutes .
my father observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river where the Leopard was located and I immediately started to kne@@ eling pictures ! !
S@@ ascha aims to obtain collaboration with the authorities to obtain worldwide recognition of Nep@@ als nature and would like to understand the understanding that raw animals are not as fur@@ ious , as they look like .
and he should know it ; because he stood up Tig@@ ers from face to face toward this :
a tiger is not distur@@ b in the opinion of sheep not at bed@@ time ! !
late evening . light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
I was also because of darkness on the way to home , when suddenly the King of the bush appeared immediately . he sat immediately , we will see and star@@ red me through the Sal @-@ trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals , S@@ USS the logo &quot; I click for Conservation ( lit . : I clicked for Environmental Protection ) on his photos .
however , his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ als and wild animals is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days , and mostly lived in a tent , to make up at the Bar@@ dia National Park recordings of Ot@@ ters . up to 12 days , it took up a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds , which live near the tourist accommodation .

this post was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and originally issued on Video Vol@@ unte@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organization from India .
a revised version was again published as part of a Content Shar@@ ing Convention .
in many parts of Indian women avoid women with greatest care , the names of their hus@@ bands or even by older men in the family .
instead , they use a n@@ onom@@ ic or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
from Ch@@ av@@ is@@ gar@@ h to Mah@@ ar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h give women to respect the husband because of the social pressure , as well as fear of the consequences , they should have viol@@ ate the standard that practice this practice .
last year Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was condemned by the Indian state of O@@ th@@ a by a pseud@@ o @-@ war crimes and ch@@ ased out of their family and the village community , after having addressed a married relatives with names .
the tradition of tradition also did not call their wives , also among men , is also among men . however , they have far less conc@@ eptions to fear , if at all , they should not follow this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mah@@ ar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health staff , as well as household stuff , a unique club , and were thus fast to the main focus of the city .
it is a place only for them alone to discuss and discuss the host@@ ile of patri@@ arch@@ al .
as one of 56 clubs , which is in 13 Indian states , it is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ bad@@ al , which is operated by the Community &apos;s Video Vol@@ unte@@ ers .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ worked for seven years with the help of their video camera on the discovery of practices , such as children &apos;s marriage until the association of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS @-@ In@@ ks , and direc@@ ts these clubs .
it reports about how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time at the ambassador of the wall .
the first video , the Roh@@ ini showed in its discussion round , did not call women who call her hus@@ bands in the name .
she decided to op@@ t for this topic , because she wanted to open the conversation about the patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem with which the women can identify slightly .
the names of their hus@@ bands do not need to discuss , there is a bro@@ ader , which they ple@@ xed to all duties and never have been question@@ ed .
Roh@@ ini means :
this tradition test@@ i@@ fies that a woman respec@@ ts her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not keep it , is considered a back as a woman without Mor@@ al .
the tradition is so deeply ro@@ oted that we have never made us up to this discussion round thoughts .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini wanted to have never called her husband , previously called by the name , try out at home , as it runs .
they showed the video of the discussion round their husband and mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells about :
my mother in law and my husband still weigh long after the video was at the end .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pra@@ k@@ ash , my husband , turned to me , saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I should call him from now on his name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage , Roh@@ ini started her first discussion .
many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; never before . some believed that there was a good thing because it meant that the younger members would be protected from a family , especially girls and women .
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection the women tried to bring discussion with an exercise in motion .
Roh@@ ini bat any participant in the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , off@@ ended , sad , loving , and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then said they all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If we cannot tell the name of our hus@@ bands , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they can call us as they could not respect us ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
should it not be equal ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of these women have been married since 30 years , and this was the first day that they brought the name of their hus@@ bands on the lips &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ar@@ ash@@ tra over the Bre@@ chen of a centuries of old traditions , in which women married the name of their hus@@ bands ever . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roh@@ ini tells about :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a woman was so sh@@ y , that , while the whole exercise was just outside the whole exercise ; a other decided to settle the whole fru@@ str@@ ation against him and his family , taking him cursed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think it will never forget it again .
even in the A@@ dr@@ en@@ al@@ in@@ fr@@ enz@@ y , with an ancient bridge , the women decided that they were actually trying to call her hus@@ bands in the name .
and they kept their word .
in the next days Roh@@ ini received a number of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she sat among women in the head : his wife could not stop his name .
another club member decided to do it with dinner before the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law she was afraid , she was afraid , saying that it was an error .
&quot; &quot; &quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I should do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a husband of participants in attendance was less under@@ stand@@ able and the situation was art@@ ed in violence .
Roh@@ ini reports , such as women tried to stop other practices , such as the Tra@@ cking of the zin@@ no@@ red dot at the fore@@ head , shows the status status :
why must only women show that they are married ?
I said to my husband , that I would bear the zin@@ no@@ red dot when he would like it .
he laugh@@ ed only and I list@@ ened to him to carry him .
the other women have not heard completely , but mine , they are now in a better position , even to choose him on some days .
for many women , the Discussion Papers b is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals .
&quot; we are doing an excursion on every discussion .
normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to make women make women , who could hear what &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last few months , they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cake , and they d@@ anced and sang , and talked about things , which they never did before@@ hand .
Roh@@ ini is saying :
I have been working on these problems since so many years now and I have been associated with some things , for example how our identity are linked to our hus@@ bands , never as hon@@ est .
it feels great to say that certain things can tell you , no matter how small they occur .
in a discussion round we have under@@ ne@@ ath the concept of honor and is connected to the clothing .
some women in the group have only been borne by Sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most of them is okay , but some wanted to have a salad @-@ Kur@@ ta , a wide shirt of a bun@@ ny , they have not dre@@ amed .
after much argument and discussion on the advantages of their own hang@@ ers , the mor@@ ally connected with Sar@@ is and much more , tast@@ es of her own pairs of Kur@@ t@@ as ( upper in@@ hibit ) into a discussion round , so that women could bear them .
next , they decided to plan to plan a trip to Go@@ a , where they can bear Je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is sure that they will be able to create it .
on the question , whether in the five months since its first review , Roh@@ ini confirms that the things slowly emerg@@ es slowly into the rolls :
we have made only small steps so far .
some women tested it a few times , but then heard it again to say the name of her husband .
some that included me , but only if they are alone and no other family members are present .
only one or two will continue to say the names of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now wear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red on their fore@@ head .
the women in discussion d@@ b know that the changes that they would like to reach more freedom of movement or their own hang@@ ers - at the end of a difficult to navigate river .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; having confidence in each other self @-@ confidence , will be aware of them in the same boat . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how Roh@@ ini explained :
every one of us is a Vic@@ tims of Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the club there is confidence of us , that will change anything . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction if any woman goes in the club to home and other people , what we speak and what we do .
we all sit in the same boat .

it is the first time that successive attacks on gl@@ ass@@ els were registered in Mozambique .
a further group , the goal of murder for ob@@ sc@@ ure purposes is people with Al@@ bin@@ ism .
this resulted in a mission through the UN to investigate these practices in the South African country in 2016 .

a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , which was probably recently made recently .
this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version is published as part of a partner agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of imprisoned Chinese dis@@ sidents Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has drawn attention in the international community , after his lawyer was announced at the end of June that he had been hosp@@ ital@@ ized due to liver cancer in the final stage .
in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( state of state ) , after he calls on the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o which was involved in the democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred the case as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an internal matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a speaker told it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , China continues to continue its views from the international community , the Nobel Prize Lau@@ re@@ ates and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , allowing him to allow treatment abroad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while some countries critic@@ ises the strict treatment of the passport in Beijing , others are completely bl@@ ended . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hong Kong Free Press has collected some reactions from abroad .
United Nations
Z@@ vy R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the High Commissioner of the United Nations for Human Rights , met at the end of June Chinese officials to discuss the fall of Li@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a speaker rejected it , however , to comment whether the United Nations should enable pressure to enable Li@@ u abroad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Norway and Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ Ã¸r@@ ge Br@@ end have refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
the relationship between China and Norway was put into stores after the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010 was awarded to Li@@ u , although the Norwegian government announced that this was nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations were resumed only in December last year . in June Norway , Norway signed an agreement to re@@ build the sal@@ mon to China , since the exports were largely blo@@ cked since 2010 .
after the message had been dissem@@ inated that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee brought his hope to an un@@ conditional release , and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo .
due to his detention , he was not able to accept his prize .
during the ceremony , Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a decision on which China was called to liber@@ ate Li@@ u and his wife immediately from house arrest and to allow him to seek medical support where he wants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Diplom@@ at@@ ine of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , called China to release the release of Li@@ us as it was published in a declaration on June 30 : &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are looking forward to seeing China all limitations of Mr. Li@@ us wife and family members .
they shall meet all visits and receive , who wish them , and may be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
USA
&quot; &quot; &quot; U.S. Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad declares that the Americans wish him &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said that he has the opportunity to treat abroad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in respect of his satisfaction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokesperson for the US Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the news agency AFP on June 27th , that the embassy sent out the Chinese authorities not only Li@@ u , but also free his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the US embassy moved to China after itself , with the utter@@ ance of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no country the right to en@@ um@@ my and imm@@ ort@@ al remarks on Chinese internal affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pol@@ ley divided that China should offer the couple of the following :
protection and freedom like travel documents and access to the medical care of its choice , which they are entitled to the Chinese constitution and legal system as well as international obligations .
the U.S. Sen@@ ators Marco Rub@@ io , Jeff Merk@@ ley and Ted Cruz have also introduced a decision in the Congress to penet@@ rate the Chinese government to dr@@ on , Li@@ u and his wife un@@ conditi@@ onally release .
I challenge China to release the Nobel prize lau@@ re@@ ate # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o un@@ conditi@@ onally , so that he may know in a proper medical treatment . h@@ tt@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
in Germany
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German government spokes@@ Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin that Li@@ u will get all the medical support he needed &quot; and that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chinese president X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping appeared on July 7 and 8 at the G20 summit in Hamburg .
previously , diplomatic sources reported in Beijing from Reuters news agency that China had great concerns whether the ver@@ tex could over@@ leave Li@@ u visit to Hamburg .
Canada to Canada
on 28 June , the Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um China called for a reasonable medical care and to give him the possibility to give him away from his family .
Li@@ us An@@ advoc@@ ate AFP previously told that Li@@ us woman , Li@@ u X@@ ia could visit him every day , but the police always keeps the room in the hospital , and that Li@@ u is not permitted to speak with someone outside , including his lawyers , and to contact us .
Mc@@ Call@@ um tells you :
Canada ur@@ ges China to adopt its international human rights liability , including freedom of expression , to true and safegu@@ ard the rights of this rights .
France and France
in a declaration on 29 June , France &apos;s Foreign Ministry asked for the reasons to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all treatments , which he needs , regardless where , in addition to his wife and his family may have to contact him .
although the news broad@@ caster France information reported that the French government would be called Li@@ u in the country , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , announced that no further information can be found if France may finally receive him .
Taiwan
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of Fest@@ spiel@@ haus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Council ur@@ ged China on June 27 to release Li@@ u , and require a bigger tolerance to those who require peaceful resources to demand political reforms and democratic development . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Taiwan , the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legisl@@ ature Yu Me@@ i @-@ nu was also called to allow China to handle the intellec@@ tu@@ als of the intellec@@ tu@@ als of Li@@ u in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , revealed Himself in a statement on 28 June at Li@@ u , and gave that many have asked him to pray for Li@@ us well @-@ being .
he said about Li@@ u :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is my belief that he took and had been punished for which he had been committed to a harmon@@ ious , stable and we@@ al@@ thy China , which again would have contributed to a peaceful world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I felt very well and encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellec@@ tu@@ als and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , the charter of 08 signed for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or Land ?

is Singapore a city or a country ?
the question may be du@@ mm , since Singapore is recognized as an independent state .
but according to the Minister of Justice , K. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am should be considered as a city .
this re@@ mark has triggered a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
during the meeting on the meeting of a meeting of the State of the State of New York , the Minister noted that many people critic@@ ises the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore as compared to Singapore with other countries .
it under@@ stands that Singapore should be considered as a city .
... no one has question@@ ed whether New York is a democracy ...
that is , the most people go into an error .
I tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are no country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Blog Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io accused the Minister of Justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; turn to logic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to defend the existing authorised exercise of power in Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then , according to all our efforts and offered , this precious country does not hear that we are finally no country .
it was so volcan@@ ic , it had the calls of a escape before the responsibilities , a mandatory violation .
Singapore , if you are not my country , whose land is it ?
the reasons led by Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am were not very Nobel : he def@@ ended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in view of what , it appeared in@@ sof@@ tened .
in contrast , he def@@ ended the idea that Singapore should be compared to Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities which are permanently managed by a party .
these cities are democratic .
once you reach the core point of the River Th@@ as , the good old Lei@@ er of the author@@ itarian sei@@ zu@@ res , which pre@@ di@@ ct Democrats , leaving logic , because it fits better to their power .
in the final effect the answers were given in the last week of Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am &apos;s answers to its American guest on our press , our J@@ udi@@ k@@ ative , our political system really non @-@ answers .
related questions tar@@ ma@@ yed with non @-@ answers species .
Rachel Z@@ eng requires Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am to illustr@@ ate his opinion , because they did not understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
if Singapore is not a country , but a city is to which country belongs to our city ...
shortly , I understand nothing .
I would be very than@@ k@@ ful when our wer@@ ter K sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am would take on the trouble to clari@@ fy this point if he was high , to be part of the government of the City of Singapore .
by clicking on the blog , he has published his comment on the reviews that you should start to read the entire address of the conference , to understand the context of the statements by Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am , according to which Singapore is a city and there is no country .
read the address .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore was rather a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; than a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said why the elections in Singapore will be so un@@ important , even if we look forward to free and righteous elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he contrac@@ tu@@ ally Singapore with cities in the United States ( and how many of these cities saw a party ever ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he said , Singapore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he apparently not in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cl@@ ement T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment about Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am , who makes a leader of a her@@ an generation that makes such pol@@ em@@ ic statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m talking about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore has said , &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least I knew Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old Gar@@ de , which awaits me - should I agree with them or not , but this is a different thing .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am , member of the new generation of the political leader of Singapore , I doubt and I &apos;m not even sure if he really believes that he is def@@ ended , what he def@@ ended .
the Tem@@ as@@ ek Review specifies the weak@@ nesses of Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ hs arguments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has committed a mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or was it a man spokes@@ man ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
when Singapore is not a country , we only considered independent and so@@ vereign state ?
if not , on which country go the so@@ vereign rights of the city of Singapore ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally country and city .
since he plays an important role within the government &apos;s pur@@ ification , the statements of Mr. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am are of serious importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why do the Singap@@ ore@@ an their military service , they defend only their city but not their country ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who must pay our Prime Minister invo@@ ices ?
what is the value of our pink staff ?
are we citizens of a country or inhabitants of a city ?
, ten@@ ds the Journey Journey of a Dec@@ ade for the Be@@ years , Singapore and was always a city :
&quot; I didn &apos;t say what I said ... &quot;
this proposition appears to have a lot of Singapore ...
no one has ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we &apos;ve always been a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear people like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defense of the country above all &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but this is not quite true . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should talk to the defence of the city .
the myth of the &quot; net@@ tes can@@ adi@@ ers &quot;

global Vo@@ ices asked short of his editors : what is the most failed aspect regarding your residence or home country ?
their answers are published here as part of a ongoing series , with rum@@ ors above certain parts of the world , and another fac@@ et should be shown .
the latest part of this series is from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the question that is most asked in Japan is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are you Americans ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 1994 I live and again in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ever , in which situation the conversation takes place , it is considered pol@@ ite to show interest in his talk partner by making personal questions .
for my clari@@ fication then the standard answer is then : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice @-@ ho@@ ckey , nature . &quot; lots of Canadi@@ ans may cook , if they are kept for Americans , but anno@@ ys me not .
for someone who doesn &apos;t know , there are little , which distingu@@ ishes us Canadian of Americans .
this is one of the reasons why many Canadi@@ ans have a Canadian flag feel good to their back@@ pack if they travel .
all love Canadian .
Americans are on ... .
so it was even when I began 20 years ago to travel through the world - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 .
Canadi@@ ans have always carried little A@@ hor@@ n@@ sheets on their baggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free healthcare !
with us there is no weapons !
gender equality are legally established in Canada since 2005 !
all seem to think , Canada is so great .
we are cour@@ te@@ ous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we obviously say very often &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exc@@ use . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada is supposed to be regarded as the most toler@@ ant country on ethnic groups .
we are not like those types south of the border .
we are Canadian .
I hate it .
first I got a lot of American friends which I wonder@@ ed .
it would not make me anything , if you would change me with Johnny in Dallas .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
first : as &quot; nice &quot; signi@@ fies to be , called in the reason to be di@@ ligent , but trag@@ ically un@@ important figure N@@ ed Flanders , &quot; The Simp@@ son &quot; ( who has his own Canadian Doppel@@ gÃ¤n@@ ger ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Canada would really be a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flanders , it would indeed be a step forward . but the actual problem exists in that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are no edges and edges , nothing can be seen at that time .
harm@@ less , means in@@ consp@@ ic@@ uous and un@@ interesting to earn and make no attention .
this may be something good , if you want to finish un@@ noticed in the background , away from the things that happen to around .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would even be going to say that the wish is free and only to be a main leadership of the Canadian . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; is perhaps simply cool courtesy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canadi@@ ans are not often talking about the fence with the neighbours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we lack the warm , open kindness , whom I have now connected to my US friends . &quot; &quot; &quot;
fortunately for us ( and for the rest of the world ) , Just@@ in Tru@@ de@@ au is the stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice &quot; . our prime minister Canada has made known to sexy .
music video of a pop @-@ band par@@ odi@@ ert Tha@@ il@@ ar Jun@@ ta
one of the famous pop @-@ band played a music video which took the Jun@@ ta par@@ odi@@ ert who took power in 2014 and re@@ produce the civilian government despite their promises to restore the country .
the new song &quot; dict@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ sted girl ) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who told him which makes his friend his gir@@ l@@ friend .
although not expressly polit@@ ically , the music video is indirectly linked to the continuing military coup of the Jun@@ ta .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation in the country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the video for song was a huge success .
in the first three days alone it was shared on Facebook high @-@ loaded video 1.@@ 254 times and received 8.@@ 800 li@@ kes .
last month the Charlie Chap@@ lin @-@ Video &quot; The dict@@ ator &quot; was blo@@ cked in Thailand after a group of activ@@ ist activ@@ ist this video .
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entert@@ aining introduction to the Thai policy , in@@ particular how it holds the position of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule .
check out these videos of the video which rel@@ ate to some of the political topics related to Thailand in the past three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 44 rules of girls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ical Section 44 of the preliminary constitution , which is given the Commander of an absolute decision on major national issues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the not@@ ori@@ ous program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people who can be viewed by the Jun@@ ta as a critic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the picture above reflects the introduction of the law of computer crime against , whose v@@ age and un@@ clear rules are often used by the authorities to have activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit was established in the army , the online content is monitored and persons , which is accused of having prosec@@ uted the mon@@ archy .
Thailand sets a stri@@ pped face against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ est &quot; ( Maj@@ esty ) .
on 20 May 2014 , the law was proclaimed in Thailand .
two days later there came to a coup of the army .
one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to buy their decision @-@ to buy their decision , although security experts war@@ med that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of taxes .
in the video , it will even be shown , how people can be thrown into a black v@@ ans before they bring them to an intern@@ ment camp , another problem .
some journalists are in prison , because they have caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society , and Internet users are threatened with long pen@@ alties , they should off@@ end the mon@@ archy .

the following article was published by Dmit@@ ri St@@ ey@@ no@@ v , first published on the website of OC Media and appears here with friendly permission .
the post @-@ war society re@@ covers slowly in East @-@ Ab@@ ch@@ asia , mainly in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
now it has passed over 20 years since the Austr@@ o @-@ ab@@ as@@ ian war has been officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still visible in this part of the republic still visible .
the abandoned villages of the northern district show striking images .
villages like D@@ zh@@ an@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ k@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ ava are in the carbohydr@@ ate basin of Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
various ethnic groups such as Rus@@ sians , Greeks , am@@ il@@ ies , Geor@@ ger and Armen@@ ians lived and worked to so@@ jour@@ ne@@ ath in the area .
many of them had to leave their houses during the war .
today , the largest part Rus@@ sians and Ab@@ ch@@ ases are living in the area .
such sett@@ lers are also called in Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
there were still more than 10,000 people here in the war period , today a few hundred people present in these cl@@ ergy .
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of the district were 16,000 people , after having barely increased over a decade .
in 1989 about 43@@ ,000 people lived in this district .

&quot; this is a consequence of the war &quot;
the empty five @-@ story blocks of the Soviet Union from the early &apos; 60s , which are called Ch@@ ru@@ sch@@ t@@ k@@ ow@@ kas are symbolic for the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are fallen and very rare , they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ zh@@ an@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native man .
he starts a conversation and it falls heavily to end this .
&quot; this is a consequence of the war . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; can I speak with you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is clear . &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
there was community centers , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens , who served all of the community .
now there is only paved road with infl@@ atable spl@@ end@@ or @-@ buildings .
the people who once lived on this site and had their contribution to the central planning industry of the Soviet Union , have now abandoned the district .
in the Spirit of D@@ zh@@ an@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , about fifty inhabitants live .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a in the other villages it looks like .
the Ch@@ ru@@ sch@@ sch@@ ow@@ kas , which can accommodate one or two families , recognizes in the balconies where laundry is dried up .
two young girls , both of seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when they detect me with the camera in the hand , they immediately drag it immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our mother forbidden us to photograph us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she just banned us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the dam@@ sel whis@@ pers at her gir@@ l@@ friend and suddenly leave the destroyed buildings and van@@ ish .
many people work in the area for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al@@ ug@@ ol .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence industry ( Cul@@ tiv@@ ation of agriculture products ) such as animal breeding , be@@ eke@@ eping and vegetable construction .
it is difficult to come about the laps .
the district administration provides free candles and bread to the villages in winter .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build zu@@ cchini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
about ten years ago , an older woman named Gal@@ ina ( or a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a , as she is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
despite their oldest daughter , who lives in France , Gal@@ ina has not left Ab@@ ch@@ asia to live with her . &quot; my heart will remain forever in Ab@@ ch@@ asia , &quot; she tells her .
Gal@@ ina wants to accept any financial assistance from their daughter and continued to support their young grand@@ son instead .
Gal@@ inas monthly r@@ ents are just nine dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very hard to survive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; a 90 year old woman and a young family and I live in this building .
if holidays are , we are visiting us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but we cannot do this - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while she tells her story , a younger neigh@@ bor appears on the balcony .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nat@@ asha , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; call T@@ ante G@@ aly@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we could build zu@@ cchini . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I prepared the ground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build zu@@ cchini . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you can get to all things &quot;
G@@ aly@@ as conversation in Nat@@ ascha together with her husband and her five common children lived in her house for some time .
Nat@@ asha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day she reminds me of the village before the war .
despite the relatives who live in Central rus@@ sia , Oss@@ et@@ ia and Georgia ( the Land Ab@@ ch@@ asia broke out ) , they did not leave the opportunity to leave it .

&quot; we recently bought land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administration capital in Ab@@ ch@@ asia ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build an house there , but it will still take anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ ascha receives about $ 9 children &apos;s money for each child .
her husband works in the Kohl@@ eng@@ ru@@ be .
the young family has its own farm .
near the house where Nat@@ asch@@ as kinder@@ garten once found , they hold pigs , cows , H@@ aly@@ ne and chick@@ ens .
it tells you that it was initially a very anxi@@ ous situation , when many people left the village after the war .
but in the course of time they lost their dist@@ resses .

&quot; we have no fear in front of the dark road or the few people .
you can get up to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
in fact , it really has something to do with pill@@ age .
after the war there were hardly working and all lived as it was right .
I remember every day , as the city and the war were once . &quot;
when our conversation rises to the end , a little boy passed to us .
it runs through the windows of a destroyed building and hidden .
a ball flies from the window and another boy followed him .
he plays with the ball , then roll down the hill .
a group of children now pursu@@ es the ball .
while they run , some of them put stones into the falling building .
these ruins are part of their childhood which provide un@@ certainty in their lives .
they do not know differently .

&quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mig@@ rant on their long journey
Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez will guide a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , on the border of Mexico to Guatemala .

this article by Amy Bra@@ cken was published on April 19 , 2017 on the website of our Partners PR@@ I.@@ org .
on the way of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America , some places are known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tap@@ ach@@ ula where he is located at the border with Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city centre .
it is directed by a 59@@ - year @-@ old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral pink Br@@ ill@@ en@@ frame and gold @-@ coloured ear@@ rings in ted@@ dy dy@@ nast@@ y shape .
she is called Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many under the name Mama Africa .
this nickn@@ ame is the fact that the hotel ( or rather she ) has become a goal for Afri@@ cans and Ha@@ iti@@ ans who are on the passage .
the hotel has no charm .
for about 2,50 dollar the night sleeping guests can sleep in simple rooms , with grinding , br@@ ushed walls and beds made of metal .
in the entrance , there is a par@@ r@@ ots in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - yet hundreds of African and ha@@ iti@@ an migrants are here .
sometimes , Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez told the people in full small bus@@ ses and from the upper part of the coast to call : &quot; Mama Africa !
where are you m@@ um Africa ? &quot;
at the moment it is rather quiet but in this year Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez has received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have also slept outside on cardboard .
she would not refuse to refuse .
she also helps them , and brings them to the hospital if they are sick , they bu@@ ys them medicines that they can &apos;t pay them , mass@@ aging them with a bal@@ m away from the long journey .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived in front of a short time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I asked him if Mama is a reasonable top name for Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Sebasti@@ ao family ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has been pos@@ ed by a yo@@ gh@@ urt sta@@ che ) pos@@ ing with Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : Amy Bra@@ cken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel that it fits to her because African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very lov@@ ingly .
she has the heart of a mother ...
we feel very good here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister , who hopes to go to Boston to get there her husband and three children .
they already lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans , which are on the way into the United States , normally a first stop in South America and then go towards the north .
the family had heard of other star@@ ters from Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the route , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti .
it tells that Ha@@ iti@@ ans and Afri@@ cans often travel together the tour and that Afri@@ kaner would speak to W@@ hat@@ s@@ app by Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
as many of its approach , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil before and worked as a construction worker on building sites of the Olympic Games and the FIFA World Cup .
when Brazilian economy has been weaker , he has started his journey into the United States .
he has been a guest of Mama Africa since months : it sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the Bust@@ ick@@ et to Ti@@ ju@@ ana .
I ask him if he will contact Ms Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we will never go back again &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he answers sm@@ iling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez tells you that their guests have often send text messages , if they have continued to visit her , or to report about the course of their journey .
it explains that her Christian faith is the pro@@ pul@@ sion of their work .
they don &apos;t know much about Africa but their guests have taught chicken as in Ghana .
Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez is perhaps known here , but it is not the only radio hope for migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
the other end of the city leads a blind alley to Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter is Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family of migrants in their small house .
he is polic@@ eman and has found that the Bust@@ s will be sold to numerous African migrants .
he began to help them to get a reasonable price , then he has offered them his house for one dollar the night .
at the moment 25 people , mainly Ha@@ iti@@ ans are mainly Ha@@ iti@@ ans .
some sleeping on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have experienced what they can experience . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I crossed the border via the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others not help . this is the reason why I give them my support . &quot;
after he lived for three years , he was transferred to the United States after a raid on his work office .
the majority of migrants who travels across Tap@@ ach@@ ula , comes from Central America , other inhabitants also open the doors of their houses for them .
JosÃ© Antonio Cord@@ ova Mel@@ Ã©n@@ dez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children , who wanted to press the money from him , without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for a accommodation and an unknown , a sole owner , has offered her roof .
a few months later , the family lives and try to decide where the next steps should go .
back to the house of Mama Africa is all full of guests .
in the steps you consult the travel quiet their phones .
a small bus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , most of Somalia .
Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez appears happy about that her house is full , but it is also nost@@ algia , because of those who have gone away .
like a proud grand@@ mother , she bl@@ amed her album with numerous photos .
there is one of their daughter with African hair@@ pin , which you made a customer , some photos of their grand@@ kids and many trav@@ ellers more , boy and old .
she laugh@@ ed , while she briefly presented her .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ eron , &quot; it is repeated every time . &quot; they have already gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang inhabitants are forced to install on their cell phone an surveillance app .
there is a check @-@ in for personal communication instruments in X@@ inj@@ ang from Twitter user to the belief .
the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , a ethnic minority region in the West of China , are forced to install a Spyware on their mobile phones .
on 10 July , the mobile users received a mobile telephone notification in the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an district of Ur@@ um@@ qi , in which it exhibits the District Government to install an surveillance app named J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web @-@ cleaning &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Communication , the app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will tell access to terrorist information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but k@@ Ã²@@ s the app also use the app for more than com@@ b@@ ating terrorism .
according to a exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women have been arrested in autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ fecture because they had replaced the app , news with a private We@@ chat group .
in the communication of the police , the app the sources and the distribution paths of terror@@ ists would follow , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , pictures , e@@ books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ w@@ angs website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elecom .
the main function is the block por@@ no@@ graphic websites , from online fraud , tro@@ users and Ph@@ ishing pages to make users to make attention online , how much time they spend online , and to control the own home network .
this app with filters for min@@ ors is to help the children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can be used in a diverse way .

this introduction is consistent with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
while noti@@ fications of digital c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in China are mostly concentrated on the experiences of users in the eastern and south , the reality is very often dim for those who live in remote @-@ known ethnic minority regions like X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in conflict areas , the authorities are often arrange extreme c@@ ens@@ ors and monitoring measures as well as rout@@ in@@ ely internet off .
this is based on Twitter based media out@@ let &quot; Images from the Republic of China &quot; ( suspic@@ ious English ) , the cen@@ sored news in China , showed photos from a Check@@ point , to the polic@@ emen the inhabitants random@@ ly presented whether they had the surveillance app had been installed .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian ensure that people are using the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification demanded that people install the app within 10 days .
if you find at a Check@@ point with a device without these software , they could be imprisoned for up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they forced the people to use devices that are intended for elderly people .
this is a form of captivity by law @-@ awak@@ ening technology .
we are back again in Ma@@ os China .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rules in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a reaction to the instructions of the city of party , to minim@@ ize the dissem@@ ination of illegal content . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all government branches , authorities and the associated facilities , including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the instructions of Cyber@@ security Office on the operation of their computer and communication instruments .
a current report by Freedom House , an American human rights organisation , also mentioned these new surveillance methods :

sleep or death , Part 1 : all crying after death
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .
photo of : Cor@@ rie Bar@@ cli@@ more ( CC B@@ Y 2.0 ) .
this is the first of six reports in series &quot; sleep or death &quot; in which the active is Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane signs his experiences in a Syrian prison .
far away from our blue , virtual world you look at and stell@@ ations that you are in one place in which everything important is gone .
everything has gone after and dis@@ solves and dis@@ closed a truth , which is clearly recogni@@ z@@ able , both from inside and outside .
one that makes her name all the glory .
one who found themselves in a list of feelings and press down out there is no met@@ aph@@ or .
but when you turn back the reality - beyond the actor , the beautiful scenes and the actors - turn the characters into beings of meat and blood , and all of them cri@@ es after death .
all doub@@ ts are dissolved in smoke , and you will be aware of your existence , even if the earth are caught on the axis of the accident . you will be clear that you are captured here between the walls , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone built around stone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she was arrested me and arrested my father three times , but this was not enough to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my lesson , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the chief of the security services is formulated with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he introduced his power over us , making it even the sim@@ pl@@ est concepts that we knew .
five young people were torn down during a peaceful protests , such as im@@ herb from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
it was sufficient to prevent the city the darkness of the night with &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; -@@ Schrei@@ er .
all neighbour@@ hoods cov@@ eted , only my own is not .
for the first time it was still , ra@@ is@@ eless , at the wrong time , even if I had no high demands on a city , which is to be stopped to the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their compli@@ ments .
in the third night the things had a bit s@@ ooth@@ es after the power supply were stopped in the quarter .
I broke out silence , I scre@@ amed several times &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; from my house d@@ ach .
I heard my voice by silence .
a few minutes later , some of my friends felt enough to find together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends closed me , we were al@@ lied to a splendid picture that my expectations full and completely fulfilled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in such a moment you will be aware that you delivered the spirit from the lamp , but it is not interested in the least . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make you ready , we meet us at the military security building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he laid up .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey thou can@@ st , nothing can return to you , after you have carved it all the way to the office of security service from the body .
I arrived there .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men : my father was already there , as I now also .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the colon@@ el of Gh@@ ass@@ an starts to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Let me hear , as you cry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to cry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or you are only bra@@ ve enough to cry if we are not nearby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
its h@@ asser@@ t eyes were set up on me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you are sad to look for me in eyes , and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what then did I do nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood before this building .
perhaps it was in my fool@@ ish@@ ness , vanity ; perhaps at the revolution .
I was so certain when I answered : &quot; I would not have thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday .
and I think I have never heard to look to you in the eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was the shortest entertainment to have such fat@@ eful consequences for me , and I don &apos;t regre@@ t any word from what I said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in individual and his father equal with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; his father equal with it . &quot;
the st@@ ank of this pro@@ flu@@ x is given me up to now in the nose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he became a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; syndrome , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one se@@ cular torture , which I was exposed to monthly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I scre@@ ened the courtyard .
in the first office I leave everything I can carry with me .
after that , through the court , and into the second office , leads through one speed to the individual cells .
I memor@@ able all details exactly before I ad@@ mit the room .
otherwise , otherwise they have allocated a larger cell for this time .
I have to share them with only one single prisoners and may immediately set me without permission to wait for their permission .
after a few minutes , who felt like a whole life , the officials left the cell , and I took back on an old @-@ proven communication method : with f@@ ist against the wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I learned that my cell com@@ ra@@ de was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ sth@@ eses &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after long ignition he answered me finally .
apparently in no one of the surrounding cells was a respected man of middle @-@ aged people who like to me and called &quot; Doctor &quot; .
in the perfect darkness there is no markings facial features , and doctors there is not here ; we are all only numbers .
&quot; perhaps someone , whose voice is like my sounds like ? &quot;
all responses are connected to its existence .
perhaps he was re@@ located in one of the large cells .
perhaps he will stop immediately .
the investig@@ ator had covered me , they would stay free if I abide .
LÃ¼@@ g@@ ner .
I would like to have a bird @-@ birds in order to distribute all these scrat@@ ches , which lab@@ s in the garden of my head lab@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the distance , I don &apos;t listen to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ Ä«@@ s &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must be about 10 am in the evening , always around this time the scre@@ ams , every day .
the door opens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was always convinced that black the colour of corruption is until I saw the yellow light , which gave us the grave in person : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Donn@@ er , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 13th customs of Kor@@ an &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they are here to hear . &quot;
that was the secret revealed : in order to protect the state security before us and prevent the terror@@ ists in the Algeri@@ an dial@@ ect - thus they played their contra@@ diction card from and ver@@ ted the close eye @-@ field of its global view .
this is not a house where there is no land ; it is a curse to trans@@ verse it in order to trans@@ form the crime of their cl@@ ans into a her@@ oes .
I ad@@ mon@@ ed the hearing , and meet at Abu I@@ mad , a slim and silent man ; at least he comes so before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he starts a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can join so much Import@@ ant with your life when trying to protest this day@@ time and protest against demonstrations , so soon as soon as you will find an end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not answer .
I was we@@ aned , I didn &apos;t answer it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really can &apos;t say more precisely when ins@@ ults and pun@@ ches after a friendly conversation for me became a normal communication agent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when and how that happened , was un@@ important .
some voice in me said that I had to be punished me , even though I had done nothing to earn the penalty .
to punishment in all its variety .
his command is to rip so much flesh as possible from the body .
he calls the lov@@ ingly called &quot; Gest@@ ure . &quot;
it starts with a plastic pipe , which probably comes from the clo@@ ak .
your Hen@@ ker travels to your cry .
give him the pleasure , you can not measure you with him , and you can not keep your terror .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my cry were not accounted for him enough , so that they are the re@@ ed in the oven through a cable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
during my first arrest , I asked if the investig@@ ator had been working earlier times as a gar@@ bage dump or whether it belonged to normal working equipment .
they had four cables attached to each other , to present us from their perspective , great invention of a huge cable .
within one hour , three of them rarely changes , while I still was still in the series .
I had lost all feeling in my body - and also my voice , that &apos;s why I list@@ ened to cry .
the Hen@@ ker noted the cooling and did not fall at all , so it is the next to an electrically loaded staff .
electricity flow@@ ed my whole body enough to supply my whole quarter .
my semi @-@ cra@@ cker body , which was stretched on the ground was the perfect power conductor .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had met his duty for this night .
this must be so at midnight .
I decided to lay hold on me again ; let &apos;s say , that was my only option .
a few hours went out , which came to me like minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
the door opens and the morning light meets the room &quot; .@@ R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fic@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am answer with the voice of a exhau@@ sted young people : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my lord , my father must make fear@@ ful wor@@ ries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be silent and keep you , you will be moved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they had always released me .
where do they lead me ? !
the Jord@@ anian R@@ apper Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b speaks about the rights of the L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q + community , free expression and resistance
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b takes most of its time in the most of its time . sometimes he sl@@ otted to his screen , once again his computer , and again to his couch .
but what can you leave , there is a cigarette between his fingers or with nicotine spot@@ ted lips .
he lives in the top of his family house which had been part of them since 1967 ; the year , in which Israel had completed his occupation of the West Bank and had been forced to escape from their village in Palestine ( about : Farmer ) .
for now six years , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b is an passionate active activ@@ ist , who was transferred to the conservative majority against gender roles , sexu@@ ality and free expression through art and rap@@ es@@ .
with his music , which often sets out often with topics such as Oriental , rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian geograph@@ er , but also calls for the core of the entire Arab world . all these topics do not find only in cities in Amman , from Damascus until the whole of San@@ aa in Yemen .
with his 25 years , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees itself as someone who is not limited by limits , and he can feel according to his own statement with people who suffer under the devastating consequences of foreign inter@@ ventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if he doesn &apos;t open it , he stim@@ ulates the US foreign policy against the US foreign policy .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b considers his art in his studio in Amman .
recorded by the author .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b doesn &apos;t believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war@@ fare , anything which was born with his identity as &quot; Palestinian Ge@@ vol@@ at@@ eter of the second generation , &quot; even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think because of my own life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphas@@ ises H@@ d@@ ai@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think , because I am a man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while it is dissolved in water , the holy month Ram@@ adan . in this time it is intended for Muslims to fast@@ en from sunrise until sun@@ down . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal .
obviously , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee at a sen@@ su@@ ally called Jun@@ ction will be little with protest against Islam .
basically the pieces of warm coffee and the cock@@ tails of the K@@ ent cig@@ ars in the nose into first line of freedom .
sometimes , Jordan feels like a prison in the free sky , especially if you have a glance into the neighbouring countries .
therefore it avo@@ ids it easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ram@@ adan of water - to wear not in prison .
recently , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs adopted a show of the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a , already for the second time .
some parliamentary elections which support the Islamic action front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argu@@ ed that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ exual fron@@ ts@@ man Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no , says the cultural and traditional nor@@ ms of the country , and the main reason for the concert news .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the members and former spokes@@ woman of the Islamic Coalition DI@@ MA Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CNN , that the concert &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was cancelled due to sexual orientation of the singer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many claim also , the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab spring , human rights and free expression of opinion in the Arab world is dangerous acti@@ vis@@ m , who exhibits the ancient legitim@@ acy of author@@ itarian reg@@ imes in the entire region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a rated the j@@ ord@@ anian people as a &quot; progressive supp@@ orters of human rights &quot; which continued to use &quot; for an intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement is probably not simply sil@@ ky rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic , but actually a clear @-@ cryst@@ alline reality in Jordan was clearly reflected in H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs &apos;s work .
in the year 2016 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b traditional Gender nor@@ ms formed by his vision formed by the fate of Arabic women to have sex .
the picture shows the sk@@ el@@ eton of a obviously ador@@ ned woman whose arms and legs can stretch up to the corners of the screen .
she is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of in@@ numer@@ able women who lost their lives through the hands of them , they actually should trust .
in the past few years , Jordan has increased the number of &apos; honorary moral &apos; - the in@@ official outside .
according to Human Rights Watch , the number of Hon@@ or in 2016 reached its high point ; however , Jordan was still missing in order to support the institutional infrastructure to prevent women , victims attempted murder or domestic violence .
according to a law on the frag@@ ile conflict in 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of in@@ ward family , &quot; and for their release , often a year @-@ long bureau@@ cr@@ atic expenditure as well as the guarantee of the family is necessary that the woman will happen nothing .
also H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs music enjoys great popularity and is known to return to the themes in his country for long as tab@@ u .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b asser@@ t that his work is polit@@ ically , but dre@@ amed that he can split his music , the full of exp@@ ort@@ ite attacks on sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression of expression , not from politics .
&quot; I come from the Middle East , husband .
he became a policy of politics , &quot; he says .
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; takes H@@ d@@ ai@@ b the question after the Palestinian identity .
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; the focus will focus on poverty .
the list of songs which are polit@@ ically active in the core of political .
in March 2016 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b published a song with the title &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse repeat itself :
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is it . &quot;
in the further course of the songs , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b describes the world as a kind of market , in which one can get in his words , &quot; what you want &quot; - be faith or non @-@ believe , hetero@@ gen@@ e@@ ity or homosexu@@ ality .
he noticed that hardly any one speaks in Jordan on the rights of gay men and les@@ bi@@ ans , and that comments on the equality of L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q + individuals can be cen@@ sored in 2014 .
in 2014 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b conducted an interview for the popular j@@ ord@@ anian On@@ line@@ program Ro@@ ya , to notice later that his comments were torn from context , and in his opinion was cen@@ sored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Youtube , it was uploaded to Youtube without cuts , but only a revised version , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b advert@@ ises the Arab L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that int@@ ol@@ er@@ ance against homosexu@@ als not dis@@ agree to Islam .
he mentioned Abu Nu@@ das , a poet of the eighth century , who still has stayed in memory thanks to its hom@@ o@@ erotic poems .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b asks : if Abu Nu@@ evo should work on behalf of the pot@@ assi@@ um , in the eighth century openly could write about homosexu@@ ality , why is Jord@@ anian this ?
the real problem , so H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a or the fact that the concert was cancelled , to do .
in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ian kingdom there is nothing new , that the government attacks on the free expression of opinion , and the progressive voices will be brought to silence .
recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian news ordered several former government officials and members of the lec@@ tur@@ ban , with the grounds that they had critic@@ ized on comments in social media to assem@@ ble with the deep in the land root corruption .
in view , however , the concert of H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs is only the tip of the ice@@ berg - the actual challenge is to be a structural change in the next generation of the Jordan .
for him , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a is now for@@ ged for him for the second time , but the way of progress - so it looks like a slow , bed@@ time and internal changes . it is sure that these changes from day to day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society .
finally , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , like millions of other Arab@@ ians also , of an Arab world without inter@@ ventions from abroad .
he doesn &apos;t only dream of it , his work up to Bagh@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to experience it . &quot;
perhaps , the region will help the help of music , art and literature of a real and basic open@@ ness - and not through bombs , stre@@ et@@ itions and artificial sort of guided democracy . at least he hopes it .
so far as far as far , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b will continue to continue , and also resistance to resist .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 largest festivals in Japan .
this great , ex@@ travag@@ ant war@@ d@@ olls are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous the@@ ories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
one thought that there is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually also delivered in August in many opponents , the drums , and the tan@@ dem came from the west of Japan in the northeast of Japan to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the Em@@ ishi in the k@@ nee .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we could capture some great seats , therefore we have a great view .
one can only imagine hard , how large these parts are ...
a joint centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organised a two @-@ month exhibition at W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally .
I have been watching the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two cars are just visible .
nevertheless , for many people who take the journey to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only tru@@ e - and to spend a breathtaking way to spend his summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer Festival in the North of the country .
I was there and I found the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the view of a 18 @-@ metre high fortress was incredible .
let us enjoy the rest of the summer !

rarely were external appearance and body care as important as in this story , because it is helping to maintain the Peru@@ vian youth from crimin@@ ality and to promote a legitim@@ ate profession as the hair@@ dres@@ ser .
El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us most important port , located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of Lima , a region with a very high crime rate , where street har@@ b and illegal drug traff@@ icking are daily .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region do not feel safe .
at the same time Peru - as many other Central and South American countries - a rising demand for aesthetic services to men .
the trend , the appearance and the unusual hair@@ style of famous athletes like Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( Chile ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Peru ) , has led to do more normal citizens into the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers that can re@@ produce these elabor@@ ate hair@@ styles .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles , which go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the contest of hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 .
there are experts from each other to show who can see from them the ec@@ centric L@@ ooks , as you can see in the following video ( other videos on current compet@@ itor can be found on the public Facebook @-@ profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as school August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , who found themselves in El Call@@ ao , found here a occasion to exchange their weapons against hair@@ dres@@ ser tools and get a training in the hair@@ dres@@ ser art which allows you to find work .
motiv@@ ated by this activity and the opportunity to have dozens of young people saw that they can take a profession , who is currently in fashion .
the school offered special apprentices@@ hip workshops before the beginning of the school year and reported about some of their successes :
in 1995 we were the only specialist school in the municipality and the district , which we are very proud , because of love for the children we have built this educational community .
Colombia : love letters to gu@@ err@@ illa fighting

use with friendly permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the following article is the revised version of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Liebes@@ bot@@ an@@ cies &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which has published the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contribution is published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we write only love letters to people who know ?
is it not much more important , people who feel un@@ washed , aff@@ ection ?
exactly this question was the two young Colom@@ bian activists from the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art and Crist@@ ian Pal@@ aci@@ os by the Young @-@ Youth Foundation , and inspired them to the campaign cart@@ as p@@ or la Re@@ conc@@ ili@@ aci@@ Ã³n ( Let@@ ters to Re@@ conc@@ iliation ) , to write young people , gu@@ err@@ illa fighting letters .
it was just short before a short time , her country had to contribute to their part : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had closed a peace agreement with the gu@@ err@@ illa movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary forces of Colombia ) , which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
International was considered the sign@@ atories of the peace agreement as an important that the Colom@@ bian President JosÃ© Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its services .
however , in front of Columbus , there is still a long way to talk about a real reconciliation and peace .
Gu@@ err@@ illa fought for many years in illegal camps , exposed to war rh@@ et@@ or@@ ics , and around the clock their weapons made in their weapons to integrate them into life as civilians .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Colom@@ bian society again who had acc@@ ust@@ omed to life in perpet@@ ual fear , and in some cases , they have to record their rows and support them in creating a new life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Leonardo and Crist@@ ian were convinced that the young Kolum@@ ba had joined together and to help the integration process .
and exactly the did they do : until now , thousands young people have written letters - love messages to former gu@@ err@@ illa struggle to welcome them again in the company .
the goal of the campaign are 6@@ 900 letters , one for every former gu@@ err@@ illa fighting - which will then be handed out personally .
the Valentine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the Camp@@ a@@ ign
the idea for reconciliation was created on the World Summit of Peace Lau@@ re@@ ate , which took place in Bog@@ ot@@ Ã¡ in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Crist@@ ian had the opportunity to talk with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ y@@ arth@@ i , who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this explained that we love the people whom we love , on the day of thousands of love letters , but those that need them much more necessary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he plane , he told his love to share his love with people who needed the most ur@@ gent show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , the plan was created to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the dis@@ course of a war history to a common history of peace , &quot; they say .
so far , more than 2000 letters were collected in the framework of campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ Ã­n , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ Ã¡ .
&apos;@@ I never would have thought that someone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over on March 19 in one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o Cau@@ ca region .
a group of 40 students from the University of J@@ aver@@ iana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art traveled to the camp to deliver the letters personally .
the members of the F@@ ARC shown so on how they had done it earlier to accept the commands of their leader .
but this time they did not receive commands , but letters from people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for all involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings one can walk in just a few hours - from anxi@@ ety to luck and everything that is between &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the political science student Manuela Jim@@ Ã©@@ nez Av@@ ila later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the govern@@ ors of the Valle del Cau@@ ca province described this memor@@ able experience as follows :
after having handed over the letters , a former fighters led me by the camp of gu@@ err@@ illa fighters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when I saw in one of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cam@@ Book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( a way to live in which the gu@@ err@@ illa fighting live ) , I saw a gu@@ err@@ illa fighting who wrote something . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was afraid to enter , because in addition to his bed the M@@ GL @-@ pom@@ p was a fatal weapon in the village of Dor@@ n@@ Roman .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I asked him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hello , what do they say ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am a letter which someone has written to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; never in my life has something so nice , therefore I answer it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and suddenly I ran with tears over the che@@ eks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I embra@@ ced him completely , and set me beside the pom@@ egran@@ ates .
perhaps he was sorry for the war , I was sorry that all the years of the faithful Compan@@ ion was to be , and wanted to write this letter to write this letter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man told me more about his life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he had never expected something from life as war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have never thought to preserve him and his six brothers in front of the hunger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have never thought that someone would forgive me for my mist@@ akes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but now I know that there is a company without the open arms that wait for us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
until now I have learned , how I have to handle weapons with weapons .
but now where peace reig@@ ns , I can learn many things and work in dig@@ nity . &quot;
new voices
students and some leader of the F@@ ARC joined a discussion round .
they were all grown up as already war and the F@@ ARC already existed in secret .
therefore , the leader of the F@@ ARC proved the history of the organisation , their ide@@ als and gave insight into their views over the peace process : &quot; many years have experienced , how we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party , we can help to design the society in this country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a target of these orders it is worth to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manuela was impressed :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these people have never been found that yet had never seen hearing , and had not learned that people who were often seen as monsters , and they even hate people who were shot through their lives and environment , was very pain@@ ful for me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the truth , where the land lives , does my hurt to me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but comfort me that all men - even those who have killed and so much harm to give us something , and a smile and a hu@@ g can give us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many former fighters have answered the letters .
Gust@@ av@@ o Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o Cau@@ ca , wrote for instance Dar@@ Ã­o de Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , Archbishop of the city of Cal@@ i , the following letter :
the column was made , that according to the dis@@ armament peace would rule peace .
but this is not the case .
as long as it is in@@ equality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always give people who are ready to hold the weapons and protest to their rights . and this is also completely justified ( ... ) .
we are waiting for the F@@ ARC now in peace , on a policy without weapons .
that is why we call all the def@@ enders of peace - no matter what breed , religion or ide@@ ology , they are over all those who dream of a country in war .
we give you our word , aff@@ ord our contribution and offer sacrifices , because we know of your own experience , that nothing is simple . all of us that defend life as the basis of the existence , many difficulties will be coming .
on our way , there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them .

homosexu@@ als and qu@@ e@@ ere people who live in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region , are exposed to a large range of haz@@ ards - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and compres@@ sive .
with terror , activists have experienced the reporting of the last months over the persecution of the persecution in Che@@ chn@@ ya .
but the threat that depends as a D@@ amo@@ kl@@ ing value on the L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q municipality , is not only constructed over night .
OC Media had the opportunity to speak with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gro@@ z@@ ny , which has spoken some of their experiences with us and has talked with us about what happens in the republic .
the L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q legal situation in Che@@ chn@@ ya has conquered the international head@@ lines in front of several months after reports , killing torture and killing men in the Republic of them@@ at@@ ised .
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the Now@@ aja gas ; she threw a light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities , who fortified males and put them into secret pris@@ ons in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; you brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a Trans@@ woman , was born in Gro@@ z@@ ny and grew up there .
since her childhood , she felt that she was in reality a woman .
when she was grown up , you became aware that Che@@ chn@@ ya was not a safe place for them , so they went to Moscow .
after a group of Che@@ chens who had experienced the gender equality of their land , the hunt was opened on Sab@@ rina .
from fear of her life , she moved the last end to the USA .
Sab@@ rina : I worked as a volunteer hel@@ per in a human rights organization .
one day was told me that someone needed my help .
it was a friend of Da@@ gest@@ an , a Trans@@ woman who put in trouble .
she had no money , so I took them free without delay .
while I attempted to help her , som@@ ebody had thought of my documents , he would be a copy of my documents , and spread it anywhere in the internet , with my telephone number and a picture of me . &quot; then there is no men any more in Che@@ chn@@ ya that can eliminate these dis@@ grace ? &quot;
afterwards the photos of my documents made by all W@@ hat@@ s@@ app the round .
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
when I was doing , a few impressions from the re@@ seat of my cars I heard a male voice saying , &quot; Here is a gift for you from your un@@ cle . &quot;
when I turned back , I felt anything in my body , but I did nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard a set , but this time at the Che@@ chn@@ ya : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long will you turn to the family , you s@@ lu@@ ce ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew the person not .
I know only that there was a young man , no 30 years old .
then I lost consciousness and awak@@ ened last end of the hospital again .
apparently , some women got everything and started to scre@@ am .
the man fled .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital , I learned that I had two stit@@ ches in my right pul@@ mon@@ ary pul@@ mon@@ ary .
OC Media : in which medical wings were laid down - in whom men or women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are ob@@ sol@@ ete , there is still my male name , but the doctor prevailed , and laid me for the women .
I am very than@@ k@@ ful for this .
when I read his name for the first time at his office , I got it to do with fear ; it was a mus@@ li@@ ous , a Cau@@ cas@@ ian name .
but he turned out as good man .
I am grat@@ eful to him that he is respec@@ t@@ ful with me .
I spent more than one month in the hospital .
last February I got thre@@ ats .
they cried to me , wrote me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown .
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives .
the desired , returning to Che@@ chn@@ ya , to prove that everything was a lie .
they reported ab@@ sur@@ d demands : some said , I have proven to prove it through the streets ; others wanted to have changed my sex in Gro@@ z@@ ny , and say that I had not changed my sex that everything was shining , and Photoshop .
I have grain size C - what should I say in television ?
OC Media : how did your family trying to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : there is still heavy for them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some older people said once to my mother on the street . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They have brought a monster to the world , not just your family , but the entire republic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my mother was too much and she got a snare to the neck .
fortunately , the neighbours came and saved them .
at the moment I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved into a flat and a few hours later , there was a car with dar@@ kened window slices and a number plate with a number of 95 .
after it happened for the third time , it was clear that there was something wrong .
my human rights friends checks the number@@ ing signs - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how are you fled ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons , I want to give up their names , but I want to say that I remember them all , they have really helped me .
with her help I left the country , but then got something amazing .
I cannot understand how it could be .
shortly before my departure from Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to call my mother when I arrived .
I bought it without register without any identification , without anything .
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the rub@@ b@@ ish .
came on and checked to the hotel .
the number was registered to a stranger .
I set the SIM card to my mobile phone .
at the moment , when I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ app , I got a message : &quot; you believe not approximately , you warm@@ est in security , only because you have left the country ?
our people already know , in which hotel you know . you even know your room number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only around &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to prove you , it &apos;s the number 115 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
can you imagine that ? !
that was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in touch with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
however , we don &apos;t talk about the sexual activity , but this is a tobacco theme .
I will always bear some traditional Cau@@ cas@@ ian elements still in me .
so very I wish I wish to overcome this se@@ el@@ ic barrier .
I say always that my mother is in life , I will do my best to viol@@ ate them .
if we act with camera , I don &apos;t give me to look like the person who reminds us out of their past - thus to my male form .
but that &apos;s very difficult .
OC Media : do you know something about the current location in Che@@ chn@@ ya ?
what do your friends do , those who have stayed ?
Sab@@ rina : I submitted last week a report in Washington .
for this I needed current information about the situation in Che@@ chn@@ ya .
I spoke to someone who gave one half a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he told that Ram@@ adan were not arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait to wait for a new wave .
most likely they will now concentrate on the family and relatives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so that I have probably invite the relations with the affected person and at the end demand a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honour &quot; by blood &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : are you now still weak@@ ened men in these secret places now ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine , it would not be very much .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there were none such that have no relatives , or those who were dropped from their relatives to put Kad@@ y@@ rows court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as far as I know , they will be held there , so you can present it later as terror@@ ists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should they be converted , you will show her body on television and asser@@ ted them , they would have attacked any village or a military base . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you understand ?
as if these people not simply disappeared , but specifically under@@ di@@ pped themselves to radi@@ alize themselves .
OC Media : is it now only a mut@@ ation or have a source of this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I &apos;m just someone who was imprisoned in Ar@@ gun in a half months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says that many people have disappeared in this prison , after having grown be@@ ard . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was nothing new of them since .
they simply have taken them .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was even when they were taken away .
however , until now , they were not introduced as Band@@ its , in addition there were no reports . we noted that such actions are quite possible .
why else would you not allowed to sh@@ aving this man to sh@@ aving ?
do you know if this tra@@ ce@@ ability and demonstrations of people who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation , have already been in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I always contributed my hair for ever .
in Che@@ chn@@ ya , I had a Bob .
I think , before 2003 I was already known throughout Gro@@ z@@ ny , when I lived there - and I never had problems .
in Ernst !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when the Sh@@ aria was considered , I never had problems .
on the contrary , it was much more saf@@ er than now .
in Russia , Russia wanted to bring us to the &quot; Civil@@ ization &quot; and finally thrown us into the stone @-@ time .
OC Media : how is that possible under the Sch@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were silent ; I had coloured eyelashes , the tube of the tube and short t@@ ops .
the Ministry of the Sh@@ aria has never stopped me a hair .
before the Russian Theatre in Gro@@ z@@ ny , there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , a whole group of people like me .
it was a small place where several volumes stood , and all the city knew it , why men , young people , there met .
we have never been off@@ ended .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a Rede@@ mption : K@@ har@@ da K@@ har@@ da . that means : &quot; sp@@ o@@ ct not over the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
they often say it &apos;s often to children , if those who make sure they are fun .
OC Media : so they simply have their eyes closed before you , because they believed , they are sick ?
Sab@@ rina : Yes .
they never bel@@ ted me , never stri@@ pped and never defeated .
OC Media : how long did this Gn@@ ad@@ ore life ?
Sab@@ rina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ row came to the plan .
when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began to talk about mor@@ als in television .
he spoke not about us , but above the behaviour of women .
nevertheless - one could feel like people in the city began to change .
he who before prosp@@ er and prosp@@ ered , looking at a time with suspic@@ ion .
in the meantime I left Che@@ chn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home , I could feel how the situation in the republic has been growing steadily .
OC Media : what activity do you go now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn much more - 700 to $ 800 per month in the USA .
apart from what I am still active as a activ@@ ist .
at present I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communic@@ ating with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organize Te@@ al@@ re@@ ffs , together , I met them to the hospital and help them to get food cards .
I have no cents for this .
I discovered this human beings , when I swe@@ pt away .
I am Muslim and want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ den@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : that &apos;s al@@ ry .
so the nature , that has nothing to do with religion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is exactly the same as the Che@@ chens who prophesied to you with foam in front of the mouth that there is no tail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Da@@ gest@@ ans who have the Kab@@ ard@@ in@@ ers who have Rus@@ sians have also , who gives the whole planet it - but not in Che@@ chn@@ ya . &quot;
I am from there , that &apos;s why it is un@@ pleasant , kind of listening to me .
I meet here so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - pract@@ ising Muslims who go to the mosque and in Ram@@ adan fast@@ en - live together with men .
you know , many think of transp@@ osition of men who love men , and they believe that you should change his sex to make more intimate experiences , but this is a tru@@ ce .
these are two different things - two different types of sensitivity to be exact , different life settings .
for me it is the most important thing to feel me in my own skin and to be ashamed for my body .
do not know if I have a partner or not .
I &apos;m sorry that I &apos;ll be so personally , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago .
and I am not very sad , that I know that I am now myself .
local groups war@@ ns an increase of self @-@ mor@@ den within the pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suff@@ ers under an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the local Arab population .
since the past few months there is a strong increase of self @-@ mor@@ nings .
the photo of Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : using permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the combustion of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 marked the des@@ per@@ ate situation of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran , which is marked by poverty and unemployment , into the spot@@ light . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region in the Sou@@ thwest of Iran .
he suffered from anxi@@ ety , depression , and he sh@@ utt@@ eth for his own help to come up for his own family , Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i human rights groups who want to work and anonymous .
a video made on YouTube with the moments after he had already ign@@ ited itself .
some people create quickly to er@@ ase the fl@@ ames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought into the Tal@@ eg@@ h@@ ani hospital in the town of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources , presses were so strong that the doctors could do nothing more .
he died short time later .
it was not the only suicide in August within the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i minority interests , and activists on site warning that even more men could take life .
the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Centre for Human Rights found that this month some other - Ham@@ id Manifest@@ at , Ali Haz@@ b@@ awi , Ali Haz@@ b@@ awi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sh@@ ah@@ ab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - depends on this month .
their stories have a thing in common : there were all the family of family who , based on persecution by the Iranian government , helpful and imm@@ or@@ able to pursue their families and secure work .
Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region , which is based on the majority of Iran @-@ living Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community , was sh@@ aken by a pro@@ found economic crisis which makes it hard to fight their hab@@ it .
in front of a century , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran , until the P@@ ahl@@ avi Mon@@ archy took power and took up major efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran .
in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the biggest in Iran &apos;s largest oil and gas fields as well as some of the most influ@@ ential and valuable areas for the Iranian farming .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to be slow , and the indigenous population receives only little of this wealth .
it is often victims of un@@ treated diseases , hunger and compensation .
the Iranian regime denied the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i @-@ Arab@@ s systematic work@@ places in local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industry .
the government has also built a variety of dem@@ men , the water of the Arab regions in the Persian areas where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and Gh@@ om are approaching .
this dem@@ me is only led to destroy the devast@@ ation in the region by dr@@ y@@ ness , and local farming as well as the fish and palm industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ ha@@ w@@ zi @-@ adolescents now increased to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian General Director for cooperation , work and social welfare , reported that 5 % of Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is , who have completed one work , completed elementary school , 55 % have completed a university degree .
a &quot; systematic strategy ... the aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance &quot;
Kar@@ im Doh@@ im@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i &apos;s human rights activ@@ ist told in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; to a &quot; high rise &quot; in the number of self @-@ mor@@ den among young Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i men .
Ken@@ im@@ i said that particularly the unemployment remains worse than worse due to unemployment . reason for this , a combination of a high number of Ah@@ wa@@ z re @-@ coming Eth@@ nic Per@@ sians and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the setting process :
since function@@ aries and institutions are not preferred for Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i will have access to work opportunities in all sectors .
this is a part of the systematic policies of the ruling regime which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arab@@ s and to for@@ cing her living from her home Ah@@ wa@@ z .
there are people who had to change their benefits and sur@@ names to hide their citizenship to the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i and not toler@@ ated , because the Arab names are not toler@@ ated in the workplace , because speaking the Arab language , or the Tra@@ gen Arab clothes .
given the circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i have to carry out human rights activ@@ ist alarm , before the situation explo@@ sives .
it remains to wait whether the world aw@@ akes and it takes knowledge .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .

&quot; why don &apos;t I identify with femin@@ ism identi@@ fiable , also with the inter@@ sec@@ tional &quot;

the following article is a revised version of the opinion that was written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on the website Af@@ ro@@ f@@ Ã©@@ min@@ as . the article was object of several discussions in which many different positions came to expression .
you can read in comments under the original text .
if I say that I &apos;m not a femin@@ ist , react many women - in particular white women who describe themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ aries femin@@ ists - with fru@@ str@@ ust .
you wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even experienced well @-@ thought scientific and social arguments before me , why I should be femin@@ ist and why we generally should be all femin@@ ist * .
for example , in spite of equal education , women still earn less money than men .
that women still are still under str@@ ingent observation , if it goes back to make her body with her body .
that violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
or that cultural and social standards are still to ensure that women earlier or later in various fields of life to a smooth blan@@ ket , and that discrimination based on the sex still attrac@@ ts across many different countries and belie@@ fs .
all this is aware and known .
I am convinced of it and I am double and triple .
I am a black woman .
and yet , if I say on skin colour , on black C@@ is women , on black tran@@ si@@ den@@ te women , on black women in the L@@ GB@@ TI@@ Q community , as well as we mentioned , as well as outside of femin@@ ist movement , many white femin@@ ists and white inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists were to be silent .
however , they all agree that women - all women - together should come together , to raise their voices and &apos; K@@ umb@@ aya , my lord , &quot; to sing the equality ( some ) of women .
but they don &apos;t want to speak that there is also an institutional form of institution@@ alised form and assi@@ on@@ ably motiv@@ ated violence , which we are exposed to black women on two times .
or about that black women and women of other eth@@ nic@@ ities and origin , fewer than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with a migration background are to be taught as white girls , due to obvious integration problems .
or that women in black sp@@ ans and women with migration background are exposed to a higher risk to suffer domestic violence and violence in the partnership as white women .
on the other hand , I want to join all men , all men and all humans are not any movement in the same rights ; on the other hand , I cannot consider as a black woman who refused to consider un@@ just to consider un@@ just to the gender as well as the skin colour of a person .
I am exhau@@ sted and become no more about my citizenship in a white femin@@ ist @-@ oriented sp@@ ades , which always rejected me and countless more black women always rejected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Im@@ medi@@ ator , 1851 , in her speech : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not a woman ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I also feed myself to just@@ ify a ide@@ ology in which the black woman is a cruel and mar@@ g@@ inal being . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feed myself to join me group@@ ings , which also absorbed by cultural enrich@@ ment of our customs and customs , to drive their eg@@ o@@ centric program .
I will no longer try to settle white women the importance of the over@@ cutting of skin colour and gender . because some of them will continue to keep the importance of black women for femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women try to turn them .
although the inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded in order to give women of different her@@ on , and desc@@ end from the white femin@@ ism , in its name still the word &quot; Femin@@ ism &quot; in its name .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to join me full and whole of femin@@ ism , which was founded for my dark skin and my status as a woman who is very hard for a white femin@@ ist par@@ a@@ dig@@ m , that is so hard , that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is more important than ever before we define black women in our own performances and give us to the don@@ keys that we will be created for us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ cana wom@@ an@@ ism ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : how we can defend ourselves to defend our own kind , in which they can defend ourselves to our own kind and can be missed the spiritual elements that make the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists immediately call separ@@ at@@ ism and exclusion after they have read these lines , please inform yourself about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contra@@ dictions of femin@@ ist movement , of which the black woman is affected .

Pad@@ del@@ ights against pollution : the mission of a man that protect rivers in Iraq for future generations
this post by To@@ dd Reu@@ b@@ old was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine which reports about international efforts to resol@@ ve environmental problems .
as part of a Content Shar@@ ing Agreement , this article will be published here again .
Nab@@ il Mus@@ a traveled to Iraq in the last 7 years - usually with sur@@ f@@ board or in the can@@ oe - with a special occasions over the region of Kurdistan in Iraq . its mission aims to make people the importance of clean waters for current and future generations .
in this documentation of Emil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a , who explains its relationship to the rivers of the region and the effect of pollution in its community .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted to do something for the river which we lost , when I was still a child , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mus@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists from all the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dam , pollution and un@@ controlled development , will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organization Water@@ ke@@ e@@ pers Iraq - which works to protect the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as local communities in sustainable use of this natural resources . &quot;
at the end of the video , Mus@@ a takes the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we had no water more , how would we survive ? &quot;
this video was produced for En@@ sia by Emil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , a documentary film@@ maker and multi @-@ media journalist , filmed and published in Er@@ bil .
the emphasis on its work is followed , little substantial sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of co @-@ operative video and a new multi@@ medi@@ al techniques that can tell their stories in their ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paraguay and their difficult fight against violence
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a group women represents &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The crying women &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to bring their pain on the women &apos;s mor@@ sel in the country , and in the region to show her re@@ jection . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is the ab@@ brevi@@ ated and revised version of Article &quot; The Wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; from Kur@@ tur@@ ally . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # 1 ) , which reports on violence against women in Paraguay .
most of the names were changed to the protection of the affected persons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a police Commissioner said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez said that they could nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her partner who had become non@@ violent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; since the end of its relationship had been past time and the police said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I could not do their statement , but more could not do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a further wife Bal@@ bu@@ ena showed no mist@@ re@@ ate , the accurate display of A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez was also useful .
a few days later the second woman moved back their ad .
to break the inflation of violence against women , is difficult .
if women want to report at all time , they do not receive any support from the State .
in many cases , women are also fin@@ anci@@ ally dependent of the men that they are mis@@ har@@ assed . this also explains why only 20 % of women who have to ad@@ mit violence to be victims of violence at all in the criminal prosecution authorities .
content and Statist@@ ical 2 In@@ visible Mis@@ sions and a Legal System , which nothing under@@ lined n@@ imm@@ ort@@ 3 of the laws : good approach , lack of implementation and statistics
it is hard to determine how many women really are mist@@ re@@ ated , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez , researcher for gen@@ der@@ issues at the Centro de Haz@@ ent@@ aci@@ Ã³n y E@@ studios , a social scientific research facility in Paraguay . &quot; there are different information and reports , but not once ans@@ at@@ ra@@ ise the extent of gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
but the numbers available are al@@ ar@@ ming .
in 2015 , there were 9@@ 600 new ads due to domestic violence . at 70 % of it all went to violence against women .
86 % of ads in the police came from women .
there were more than 5000 ads due to domestic violence in peace offerings . 86 % of ads arrived from women .
in the ads , 40 % of women , that they were physi@@ cally har@@ assed , 55 % of women were suffering from psychological abuse .
but these statistics show not the real extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ian Women Minister Ana Bai@@ ard@@ i , only few of these criminal off@@ ences will actually be displayed only . &quot; on every woman , that will not be reim@@ bur@@ sed in Paraguay because of mental mist@@ re@@ ation , 9 women , which do not do this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on every woman , which will be reim@@ bur@@ sed for physical abuse , two women will not do this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated at the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since women &apos;s murder in Paraguay is not a criminal off@@ ence , the prosecution authorities cannot be appropriate to document how many women are murdered by their current or former partners .
by August 2016 , journalists numbered at least 12 cases of women in the country .
the coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to its estimates , in Paraguay all ten days a woman dies due to violence against men .

invisible mis@@ uses and a legal system that nothing under@@ takes
before Mariana Br@@ Ã­@@ te@@ z was the fixed friend of Carlos Vera , he in@@ si@@ sted that they called his name of all their former friends .
at the beginning they didn &apos;t want it , but then after . this should always regre@@ t it for ever .
today , Mariana has 28 years old and not more with Carlos together . but for two years they brought the psych@@ ic violence against women - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most severe recogni@@ z@@ able :
I have never thought that I would be victims of mist@@ re@@ ate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I read before this , I thought that only women happens to under@@ go , because they would have violent men of violent men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was convinced that this would never happen .
Mariana used social media to report about the mist@@ re@@ ate by Carlos Vera .
without name , she wrote contributions on Facebook in which they described his ins@@ ults and various attacks during their two @-@ year @-@ old relationship and told how he had isolated it .
many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rh@@ et@@ or@@ ally if he had ever lifted the hand against them , and refused to dis@@ agree that his behavior was also a form of mist@@ re@@ ate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other Facebook users said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why they had fallen so long from Carlos and left him not earlier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it seemed almost as they wanted to say that victims of mist@@ re@@ at@@ ment would have to have a certain contribut@@ ors .
Victoria Santos , who comes not from Paraguay , fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner she har@@ assed them .
Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o @-@ C@@ RE@@ O power network ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) , which consists of women who are all in any way victims of mist@@ re@@ at@@ ment .
in the group , they can talk to others about their experiences , listening to each other and support each other .
they do what many other do not do : they take the statements of women .
in Vic@@ tor@@ ias case everything began with psychological abuse .
her we@@ al@@ thy partner was finally managed to convince her , that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat them .
Vic@@ tor@@ ias displays with the authorities remained without result and also from their relatives , they received no support .
it led a trial against its former partner who developed into an un@@ interrupted judicial battle between Paraguay and its home country , mainly by money , power and influence of their former partner .
Paraguay laws : good approach , lack of implementation
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws , which are very good , but not applied .
the display of mist@@ re@@ ars is a way full of resist@@ ors and a fight against corruption in justice , &quot; says Victoria Santos .
Carmen E@@ ch@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN Organization for Women in Paraguay , sees great problems with the application of laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 , a bill was discussed at the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen Parliament , which was known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ El@@ las ( # FÃ¼r@@ y ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the movement # Ni@@ un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # Non @-@ Less ) are part of a campaign on Twitter that is supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original design of the law looks to explain Fem@@ izi@@ d to explain and har@@ der the har@@ der , as already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
so the legislative text in some points changed , in order to win the MPs for the law , so that the way for the de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions must be banned in principle , and to be punished in Paraguay up to five years imprisonment .
the original bill had fore@@ seen , most of these ( bureau@@ cr@@ atic and economic ) proce@@ eding to bear the victims of violence at present itself , if they simply want to restore and maintain a safe accommodation , to the state .
E@@ ch@@ au@@ ri argu@@ ed that the Law is not effective if the legisl@@ ator does not have sufficient financial resources for this purpose :
in Paraguay , mist@@ re@@ ate is seen as part of human relationships .
here must be a ren@@ ew , that violence is no longer regarded as a little standard .
in view of this facts , he pleaded not guilty and contributes to that the perpet@@ rators of the perpet@@ rators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must reim@@ bur@@ se this long display until mist@@ re@@ ate is no more than normal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted by the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen Senate . previously , parts of the law were changed . however , there was one passage yesterday , who called the partners in cases of domestic violence to reconciliation .
the opinions on the changes go apart .
the section regarding reconciliation was seen as an opportunity to attack the aggres@@ sor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gender &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; words , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; political force &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of parts of the law applies as a big penalty . &quot; &quot; &quot;

independent media in Oman a year after prohibition of a newspaper continue to attack attacks
&quot; this website was closed due to a resolution of the Ministry of Information &quot; on the homepage of the For@@ bidden Zeitung Az@@ am@@ n .
more than one year ago , the om@@ ic authorities closed the independent Arab newspaper Az@@ am@@ n due to their reporting on corruption in the Sult@@ ant .
You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues to be in prison , where he had a prison sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , Ibrahim Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ ir Al @-@ Ab@@ ri , were also arrested and returned to judgment .
Oman has been governed by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us ib@@ n S@@ aid , who came to power since 1970 , after he had joined his father , S@@ aid ib@@ n Ta@@ im@@ ur , led by a state of state .
since then , in addition to his role as the only Sultan , the main offices in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces , Minister of Finance , Foreign Minister , President of the Central Bank for Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the Sultan &apos;s rule is characterized by the har@@ sh efforts of security forces , in particular to public fre@@ ed@@ oms , including press freedom to restri@@ ct and human rights , independent journalist , B@@ logger and other activists .
the authorities restri@@ cts peaceful and legitim@@ ate activities in the field of human rights systematically , activists , their views over the public affairs of the country , such as corruption in authorities and institutions , both online and offline .
the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and the in@@ correct three of their editors in the last year is a hard blow for the press freedom of the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper , which has been reported on corruption in Oman ( an absolute mon@@ archy ) since its inc@@ eption in 2007 until it was forbidden by the authorities in August 2016 .
on 28 July 2016 , security forces Ibrahim Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , chief editor of Az@@ am@@ n , was published in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 . in it , there was a article entitled &quot; high @-@ ranking parties to the judi@@ ci@@ ary , and the mixture of high @-@ ranking officials in judicial decisions .
in the report , governmental officials accused the judge of the Supreme Court in Oman under pressure to raise a verdict pronoun@@ ced in an inheritance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; edition of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; edition of July 26 , 2016 with a report on the introduction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ ranking parties bind the hands of justice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ ir Al @-@ Ab@@ ri , member of the editorial Committee , was charged by the ISS before the Special Department and was arrested by security forces .
on 9 August 2016 , the ISS received the deputy chief editor of You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who had served as chief editor for Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is .
the newspaper was closed on in@@ defin@@ ite period after the information minister announced the statement that &quot; the publication and dissem@@ ination of the newspaper on every way , including online , on August 9 , 2016 . &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the trial of Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Ab@@ ri took place before the Court of Mas@@ k@@ at .
the Court condemned the three journalists to prison and ordered the final closure of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both in prison for the disorder of the public order , &quot; abuse of the Internet &quot; and &quot; sub @-@ excav@@ ation of the state . &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty and found guilty of violations of a publication of publication and destruction .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three year old pen@@ alties and money @-@ pen@@ alties in the amount of 3000 om@@ ic R@@ ial ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . Moreover , a year @-@ old professional for@@ b@@ ade was imposed against the two journalists .
al @-@ Ab@@ ri was sentenced to a year prison and a fine amount of 1000 cents ( 2600 US dollars ) after he was found guilty of use of an information network for spreading material that could represent a risk for public order . &quot;
for Al @-@ Ab@@ ri , a security deposit of 5000 Slovak R@@ ial ( 13 000 US dollars ) was scheduled and he was released on 22 August 2016 before the trial of the sentence .
on 26 December 2016 , Al @-@ Ab@@ ri said to a hearing on 26 December 2016 , Al @-@ Ha@@ j sentenced to six months &quot; imprisonment .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was dismissed on 10 April 2017 in the prison sentence of his six @-@ month prison sentence from the central prison in Mas@@ k@@ at . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison , where he joined his prison sentence .
in addition , the Appeals Court over@@ turned the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
despite the decision of the court , Az@@ am@@ n re@@ affir@@ m , the newspaper was suspended as before attacks by the Iranian government .
on 8 January , the information minister was issued an order with which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the information minister personally signed a further statement in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , and with which the Minister presented himself again against the decision of the Appeals Court to allow the publication of the newspaper .
the closing time of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where in Oman , recent days were injured .
for other injuries , for example , the closing of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ at@@ ine and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country , to put their operation .
due to the ongoing closing of Az@@ am@@ n and the detention of journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the om@@ ic authorities are still not willing to prepare an end to an extensive violation of the press freedom .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) demands the om@@ ic authorities on :
1 . You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j moved immediately and un@@ conditi@@ onally release ;
2 . create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , so that their journalists can go to their work ;
3. to protect the press freedom in the country and
4 . among all circumstances ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman may im@@ hin@@ dered their right human rights work , and without fear of ret@@ ali@@ ation , including judicial st@@ ic@@ ans .
the Golf Center for Human Rights ( Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization , supporting human rights and association of human rights and ad@@ joining states through the promotion of Mein@@ l and associations and the right to gather peace@@ fully , and provides them protection .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understanding
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , takes place with his understanding
medical research in Africa is only rare or not mentioned in the media . it is a growing area that addressed one of the most ur@@ gent needs of the continent .
there are two reasons before the place of medical research there are two reasons : for a lack of global health care , many medicines and vacc@@ ines , which cover the special medical requirements on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ culosis and malaria have significant effects in the p@@ oo@@ rest countries in Africa than elsewhere , and missing investment for research of these diseases are a large problem .
secon@@ dly , research , which is carried out by African scientists in Africa , has its own research capacities in Africa . a larger role of science and technology can only be eligible for the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of Central Center for research of inf@@ ectious diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) .
he grew up in the 1990s in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just as the AIDS epide@@ mic was the first engraved effects on national health .
he left Sam@@ bia for studying in the United States , initially in Louis@@ iana , later in Indiana .
when Post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania he resear@@ ched himself on HIV @-@ virus before he decided to go home to home the sam@@ ic health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understanding of the media .
( Dis@@ cla@@ imer : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private people ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( G@@ V ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment , the focus is on the application of research results . I supp@@ ose the sam@@ ic national program for anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
I just star@@ ved a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ o@@ gens .
g@@ v : what are your opinion about the important scientific topics in your country and general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only put solutions to that by what have been developed .
this must change , otherwise we will always stay receivers instead of the makers .
the solutions that we get , are often usable in our environment , and sometimes it is impossible to use it here .
g@@ v : where does financing and support come from ?
is it adequate ?
how easy or difficult , it is to find appropriate scientists for the projects ?
RW : from USA and Europe .
the projects are different and funded differently .
it is difficult to find people who come back or go here , because funding and development chances are better in other countries .
g@@ v : how is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work that you didn &apos;t had before ?
RW : basic infrastructure does not correspond to standards in developed countries . it costs much money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratory materials is expensive , and it takes months to import them from other countries .
g@@ v : what about the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there are already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would propose that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
g@@ v : how large is your opinion according to the potential of scientific research in Africa , which should focus on themselves , and how can we assist the development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all age groups .
there are need of special scientific training , starting at any age .
social sciences , computer science , big data , investigation of the space , health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and cont@@ ag@@ ious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine are very beneficial .
g@@ v : can you describe the advantages and dis@@ advantages of life as scientists in Africa against Western countries , based on your experience ?
RW : often are the limited speed , things to do , and the resulting access to scientific expertise , which represent the challenges .
the system that magazines are only accessible against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , also the amount of available information and speed of research .
from the USA to India : how &quot; Open Source &quot; seed producers of global food production change
this post by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky appeared initially on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine which reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank M@@ orton has been bred already since the 1980s in the USA salad .
his company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ ness , the first plant , cultivated by NASA ast@@ ron@@ au@@ ts in space and has been consumed .
for nearly 20 years , mortality has been given only by its own off@@ ence and the question as many sal@@ ut@@ ches can get limits .
but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s , he noticed that more sal@@ ads were patented and that he could not continue to use it again .
the patents are not only for individual varieties but also for certain properties like resistance to diseases , a special rotary or green or green leaves .
over the last years , more such patents have been registered for more plants such as cer@@ eal or cart@@ il@@ ions . due to this trends , plant breeding , environmental protection and experts have been providing food safety in the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia of old tradition , M@@ orton is still salad , he needs to be longer , because his work has always been increased by more restrictions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s what would be in a river a rock , to whom I have to bl@@ unt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we must do this now , but it is a fra@@ cture with the breeding tradition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that this patents will go on sal@@ ads . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and if they stand before judgment , no one can be patented , because all features are patented , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he makes it so good as possible and trying to help those who want to help you . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , however , it is very careful and ende@@ av@@ oured to use any material that is protected as intellectual property .
he also joined a movement which is always bigger in the United States and everywhere in the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; open source &quot; breeding ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; ast@@ ron@@ au@@ ts of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; International Space Station &quot; &quot; &quot; have eaten red ro@@ ast salt in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; greenhouse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; station . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the station is cultivated and eaten there if plants can be added in space space . &quot; &quot; &quot;

it is not co@@ incidence that this name does rather sound as it would come from the IT area and does not come from the area of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( Initiative for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed ) can be inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software , which provides alternatives to copyright protected by copyright .
it was established in order to ensure that some plant species and gens are not protected as intellectual property and are suitable for plant@@ ing plants .
in the context of the initiative , called Oss@@ i , US bre@@ eder can also under@@ take that other one can use them far@@ med seed .
this means that , however , do not want to do business with her seed and do not sell it . &quot; open source &quot; bre@@ eder can be used to cruci@@ fy your seed , and it will not expos@@ e to other varieties - two aspects which banned by many plant pat@@ rons .
dozens of bre@@ e@@ ders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014 .
whis@@ per@@ ing prospects
Professor of the University of Wisconsin @-@ Madison and Oss@@ i &apos;s board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are control of the seed and the possibility to breeding new plants , both important for food safety and environmental protection .
that plays an role in larger coh@@ orts such as biodiversity , rights of farmers , control over the nutrition system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bre@@ eder would try to use the latter , or not only little to use seeds with natural resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg is emphas@@ ised that the &quot; open source &quot; movement are not working with genet@@ ically modified plants .
all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetable , grain , genet@@ ically modified or not from ecological farms , which is likely to buy locally , locally and sustainable producing vegetables , such as the species is being offered on farms , such as the vegetables is bred , threat@@ ening that the vegetables is threatened .
dietary so@@ vereign without seed so@@ vereig@@ n@@ ty is not possible . &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed initiative under@@ take care of that their seed continues to be freely available . in contrast to this , seed and plant features are to be patented .
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
Oss@@ i Supp@@ orters argu@@ ed that the future of food supplies are at risk since the available gen@@ pool due to the more abundant intellectual property rights on plant material , which is therefore always limited to shr@@ ink .
Claire Lu@@ by , Executive Director of Oss@@ i , engaged in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in carr@@ ots and their availability . it took out that about one @-@ third of all the raw material features are protected as intellectual property , which is either not only available either .
for other plants , there are still no estimates , but experts like Lu@@ by promised that mass@@ aging plants like wheat in even larger style are patented as salad or carr@@ ots .
a question of vision
plants become so far@@ med that they have targeted features - from such , through which their taste or their color improves until such , because they flour@@ ished in certain environments such as jack@@ ets or diseases .
opponent of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for bre@@ eder decreases due to more patents . genetic diversity is currently more necessary than ever before , as the changing conditions due to climate change is much worse .
in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ speaking Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to know that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ tos activities . with a total of four gen@@ banks and co @-@ operation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States set itself the company for the conservation of genetic diversity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they contra@@ dic@@ ts that intellectual property is other bre@@ e@@ ders , since &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patents and the protection of plant varied innovations &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a patent is basically taken , once the patent has expired . &quot; &quot; &quot;
often this instructions help others to come with another approach to the same result .
thus , such protection is not in@@ hib@@ its innovations , but encour@@ ages them to be provided by public more material and know @-@ how . &quot;
M@@ orton looks different from different : 20 years to wait until a patent is certainly not innovations .
and if you &apos;re looking so long to wait for plants that are adapted to plants that are already lost to the changed environmental conditions , one would have lost the struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main argument for M@@ orton has always been a general meeting and continue to stay : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; independent plant breeding have neither the time nor the money for such form@@ alities , and mon@@ et@@ aries are not attractive for us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to make farmers to ease their work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is what instant drives us , and it is impossible to use us if we are not able to use the best and latest genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , M@@ orton distur@@ b themselves to patented , plant features : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are not creating the characteristics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plants make them up and bre@@ e@@ ders , we finally have no idea how the plants do it .
a secret of nature . &quot;
for Carol Dep@@ pe , plant breeding in the U.S. state , Oregon and Oss@@ i &apos;s Executive Board , there is still another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; who makes a sort of breeding , also his own values in them .
those who believe in industrial agriculture with large HÃ¶@@ fen and mon@@ oc@@ ulture believes , are needed for an extension of her@@ bic@@ ide , the breeding in its varieties of this concept of agriculture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my concept is exactly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized enterprises ( such that move on international markets , but less than such as Mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents , do not create most smaller seed companies , even without patents - either re@@ ject it or do it for too expensive and therefore not re@@ mun@@ eration , or both is the case .

M@@ orton is also known that bre@@ e@@ ders caused by the Av@@ oid of plant pat@@ rons : &quot; it looks like that I would like to produce new , stronger than companies that will be patented .
I need a new material for my catalogue , since I know that my competitors are being used for a few years ago , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent is for 20 years ago , with which one makes it very nice . &quot; worldwide reson@@ ance
although the US seem to be leading to the &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding , but the concept sp@@ ends quickly around the world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) describes itself as a professional organization in the area of resources , is an &quot; open source &quot; plant tools . to preserve the seed of traditional commercial applications , the center of farmers works together and helps them to fulfill new varieties that fulfill certain requirements .
it also supports them to come to &quot; Open Source &quot; to come and sell their own .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Organization Agre@@ ements works on an &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; License , which ultimately is a formal and legally binding form of the Oss@@ i obligation for bre@@ e@@ ders in the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( regulations for breeding themselves differ from country to land , ab@@ iding the Oss@@ i obligation not just one of one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission declares that the conventi@@ onally bred plants should not be patented . thus , it speaks against the current practice of the European Patent Office , the patents on conventional plants are allowed .
however , a statement is not yet a law , but now it is to bring to the governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line .
in October 2016 the Dutch organization H@@ iv@@ os organized a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; plant systems in Ethiopia , on the farmers , operators of seed banks and seed companies from all East Africa , to learn something about the &quot; Open Source &quot; seed movement and the global trend towards pat@@ mentation of seeds .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for H@@ iv@@ os &apos; Program for &quot; Open Source &quot; seeds declares that the organization is currently being a global alliance for &quot; Open Source &quot; plant systems that will fall off the official start next year .
a merger of environmental and development groups ( among them H@@ iv@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the Action Group on ero@@ sion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database to seed and biodiversity , to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and other - a report . it represents the view that farmers have to come to seeds and to improve seeds and to improve seed policy , so that a stable supply of food supplies may be ensured .
in the report , the importance of a varied , local supply with seeds for sustainable food systems under@@ lines - a relation to the Lu@@ by of Oss@@ i , hopes it will see him soon more people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological food has been observed , where and how little is added , and seed systems have hardly ever been played , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are trying to make people clear that more behind their food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the newest goals of the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in Egypt
still un@@ lock the Egyptian authorities in the internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a column .
on the weekend of the 05.@@ August , the Egyptian government announced the website of the Act @-@ Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world .
in August , the network published an opinion on Facebook , in which the Egyptian authorities critic@@ ised the Egyptian authorities for this step , and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Act for Human Rights Information lead , despite this attack and political rights in the Arab world , so it was never so difficult to overcome this goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was never so difficult to overcome this goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was never so difficult to overcome this goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to meet the sper@@ ity and do not aband@@ on it . we hope to meet our task . &quot; &quot; &quot;
AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first cen@@ sored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt , after the authorities blo@@ cked the independent news page MA@@ DA Mas@@ r , arab@@ ic @-@ speaking edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and Qatar of Al Jaz@@ e@@ era because of alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;

in addition to AN@@ HR@@ I , Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada has no access to the blog of the colum@@ n@@ ist and human rights research by Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada .
Zi@@ ada used his blog for the spread of colum@@ ns and articles that he writes in Egypt for non @-@ accessible websites and media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now the blog which he set up in order to handle the C@@ ens@@ ur@@ ion of the Egyptian government , even the objective of an attack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ logger , the supplier is native to Zi@@ adas blog , however , is further accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity , after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces , while he reported about the student protests and experienced a video as the police force physical violence against two students .
his article are mainly focusing on politics and human rights situation in Egypt .
in a fac@@ ebook comment , Zi@@ ada is expressed by the government and reflected what this means for him :
the blo@@ gs , blo@@ gs is very old , however , has priority on the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ att@@ ah al @-@ S@@ isi , and even if the blocking of blo@@ gs may not be significant for the world , it is now for me for two reasons :
1 ) It has succeeded to mediate the feeling of a siege ; An arrest , an attempt to murder , pre @-@ charge of the national Security Council , the blocking blo@@ gs and any other website , for which I worked .
2 ) You have proven that I did not wrote in vain . in other words , my words have influence , if also only a small audience .
I want to mention that this blog was a archive for me .
first , I used it to the post of articles to handle the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship .
but now , after having closed it , they are afraid of words , can I change the link or create a second blog .
the cour@@ ageous goes to the way up to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and expression ( AF@@ TE ) , Egyptian authorities closed some technical websites in the network of various Internet Service Provider ( IS@@ P ) , including orange , Vod@@ af@@ one and Et@@ is@@ al@@ at .
AF@@ TE also documented the options of suppliers , through the paper ensu@@ ite and private sur@@ rounds , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
AF@@ TE reported in their research :
on Monday the 12th of June we will offer how the blocking of websites that V@@ P@@ N@@ s began .
a such practice indicates the intention of the government to block content and fil@@ tering that you could have access to the Egyptian users .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the situation will also be prevented that the cen@@ sored decisions can be taken after closed doors , making the Egyptian population does not cause legal basis for judgment against this actions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship and who will attack them next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants fight .

day for day , newspapers in Brazil with whis@@ per@@ ed head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous posters .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old killed in school &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every second day a police officer was murdered in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; theft of military weapons with military weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President T@@ emer sends 8500 soldiers of the Army , Marine and Air Force in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of the economic crisis and in an ongoing financial situation , the wave of violence in Rio reached the highest stand for 10 years .
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organization Global Justice called even the United Nations to interv@@ ene .
reports like these are everyday and this is un@@ acceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; at least the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so , published for the detailed reporting on violence in Rio , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Extra &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is not normal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which she announced , a new heading called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; war in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all reports on violence in the city are now published there .
the designs for their decision declared the newspaper so :
extra will continue to report about crimes committed in any major city on the world as murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual violence , etc . everything that happens in Rio , will be published in the category &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative that we do not close our eyes before the cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a quad@@ minute video which was dealt on Facebook , Oct@@ Ã¡@@ vio Gu@@ ede@@ k declared the editor of the newspaper , that this decision was no occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure to be :
extra is probably the only newspaper on all over the world with a war ru@@ bri@@ k in a country that doesn &apos;t know the war .
the same video , a journalist , explains the newspaper that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro 8@@ 43 territories , which are controlled by criminal organizations .
in the editorial article the newspaper writes :
it is aware of that a war dis@@ course , when it is distor@@ ted , the police can be used , cru@@ el@@ ly , and then asks questions to negoti@@ ate .
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose goal is not the civilian population , but the economic power of m@@ af@@ ia and its partners .
is the term &quot; war &quot; more than they used ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ cept Bras@@ il argu@@ ed the journalist in Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira , the violence as a &quot; war . &quot; this is your opinion according to a just@@ ification of failed security policy through the media and could make it difficult to draw responsibility in the police .
this is no war .
this is the result of corruption and bad planning - how extra in the analysis of the military rates in Rio itself has shown - in combination with in@@ sufficient investment in personnel , En@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment and historical and self @-@ neg@@ atives of public service .
reminder : the state of Rio de Janeiro is greater than just his capital .

Rio de Janeiro as &quot; non @-@ violent place in Brazil , &quot; is false according to Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia : &quot; 22 of the 30 violent cities in Brazil are in the north and north east of the country . these are the latest available data .
no of these cities is in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we look at the ord@@ ability of a state , Rio is on position 16 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she writes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
extra is the company Glob@@ o , the largest media company of South America , emphas@@ ises the security policy of the State for years since years .
to these safety policy measures also the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ Ã­@@ cia Paci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , one of the state of Rio in 2003 , whose goal is to conquer a Fav@@ ela police officers to conquer a unit permanently .
at the beginning , this fact resulted in a decrease of for@@ ci@@ ble deaths . for some years , the U@@ PP was working with several reports about Sch@@ ik@@ anen and repression against poor municipalities that should actually protect the neo @-@ aff@@ air police unit , increasingly under f@@ uss .
on his Facebook page , the journalist Jo@@ Ã£o Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux set out of one of his articles from the year 2010 , in which he explains why the violence in Rio isn &apos;t visible by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as war also draws serious consequences for people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this calls for the state to use means and ways to use which is typical for a war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this belongs to the territory of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enemy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which is an illeg@@ itim@@ ate point in the landscape and the object for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; coll@@ ision damage &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ir@@ ered balls &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; war or her , fact is that the inhabitants of the Fav@@ elas dwells in Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one week it is now that the police seized the mountain by Fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho , to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ emen .
in the midst of all this force , this incident also made head@@ lines : a fruit of fruit died as a result of sch@@ izophren@@ ia , who had fired the police from a helicopter .

to stay on the life : besieged Syrians , mushrooms
screenshot from the advertising video .
source : Can@@ Do@@ action
since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 , and in the subsequent civil war many Syrian cities suffer under brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime to lo@@ yal troops .
according to victories Watch , a common initiative of the Peace Organisation PA@@ X and the Research Institute of the Syria Institute , are located in Damascus and Um@@ land , H@@ oms , D@@ eir E@@ zz@@ or and Id@@ li@@ b currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege .
the region of the Eastern Gh@@ out@@ a region is particularly strong , where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 demanded the life of hundreds of civilians .
many governments , international organisations and the Syrian opposition are based on the basis of investigations of the United Nations and other human rights organizations that the massacre was administered by the Assad regime .
since 2013 , these from Damascus reb@@ els have stood under siege outside Damascus , which led to that the inhabitants of local authorities have been eff@@ ected or covered by tun@@ nels and control points .
by the years block block@@ ade , traditional food and meat are become in@@ accessible for large parts of the population .
as counter@@ part , a group of Syrian humanitarian aid and ac@@ adem@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of Eastern Gh@@ out@@ as , as they can plant their own mushrooms as &quot; li@@ ret@@ aining food source &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they call themselves Gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ near and run the project together with the NGO Al No@@ ala .
mushrooms are not among the conventional , in Syria , and are only extremely rare part of the Syrian cuisine . their food is , however , makes it for a attractive food source for many people of the besieged East gh@@ out@@ a .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the name of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sub@@ ject Nab@@ il &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said on the French News Agency AFP : &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we decided to cultivation the cultivation of pilgrims because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant it in houses and cellars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dr. Ahmed L@@ eil@@ a , one of the organ@@ izers , reports Global Vo@@ ices , that has been fought for three years , and pressed this project known for three years , and pressed his enligh@@ tening that it gains more and more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; acquain@@ t@@ ness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to collect money for the initiative , use in consultation with the NGO Gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ close as the humanitarian Crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do .
it is planned to use 125 families knowledge to plant fung@@ us , so Dr. L@@ eil@@ a to Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the Constitution of this article , they reached over 100 % of its expected target of around 12,@@ 700 â¬ , but will continue to collect donations to Can@@ Do .
the initiative is aimed at alter@@ nat@@ ors that keep the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and humidity at 80 % .
because of fuel short@@ cut , locally produced hydro@@ carb@@ ons are used to supply the generators with the necessary energy .
Dr. L@@ eil@@ a said Global Vo@@ ices that they began with the &quot; production from the regions came from the regions , before they checked their quality , whether they are suitable for consumption .
then they planted a small mush@@ room yard in a tub . when this was done , they used a larger tub . and so on .
now they designed a &quot; teaching farm for the region . &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after 3 months , they have been spread mushrooms everywhere in East Gh@@ out@@ a .
Dr. L@@ eil@@ a explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to promote the pilgrims from various reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : fra@@ ction of siege . &quot; &quot; &quot;
providing a new food source on the market .
dissem@@ ination of a culture of self @-@ catering , self @-@ remains ( such as paper , tea , coffee set , box , etc ) to profit up new foods .
creation of new jobs , especially for women who work home .
creation of new jobs for people with disabilities , which are tied to their home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We hope to distribute this idea throughout the world , so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and siege is visible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want that our experiences are inspired by people in crisis areas and we can help humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Portuguese require justice for the victims of the fires of 2017
several hundred people protest@@ ed in many districts in Portugal , and called justice for the victims of the fires held in the north of Portugal in the north of Portugal .
two and forty persons died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the government last week out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
fires were also registered in the G@@ ali@@ zi@@ en region in Spain where there were 4 dead .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire@@ brands that spread themselves in the northern and centrally located regions of the country and reached approximately 250 million hectares of forest and many villages .
in June , in Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o Grande there was a similar tragedy in Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured .
according to the European Fore@@ stry system , which monitors the forest surfaces by satellite images , are burned in Portugal alone around 500,000 hectares of forest - a surface area of the territory of Lisbon .
in order to make you a better picture of the Ernst of the Situation : there is only a fire in 4 districts .
Portugal is bur@@ ns in the tru@@ sts of the word # Pra@@ y@@ for@@ Portugal - N@@ ata ( @ a _ at@@ ans ) October 15 , 2017
some of Twitter users divided pictures :

numerous videos spread in the network and show images that allow better insights into the cut :
the se@@ eable tragedy
the goal of the protests from Saturday was the demand for better relief and fire fighting measures through the state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people asked why the civil protection was not in the position to be the extent of the tragedy so far as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jo@@ Ã£o So@@ ver@@ al declared the association of farmers in Portugal declared the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
after Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o , streets and villages were evacu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
this Sunday they did so no@@ where : there are dozens of reports from open streets that were surrounded by fire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy could happen again as in June , as the streets were closed very late . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , construction permits approved in Ã@@ r@@ t@@ una with high Bran@@ dr@@ is@@ iko .
a large proposal for the Wal@@ vis form , which had brought the government after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was transferred from the commun@@ es which saw the new rules as an obst@@ acle for investments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government carried out a cur@@ sion of the law , which was the construction of the case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was an open back@@ door , so that everything could be built , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jo@@ Ã£o sorting of the same article in the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Quer@@ cus Organization made it attention to attention that large surfaces with eu@@ cal@@ ypt@@ us trees , trees made of easily flamm@@ able wood , as in a Teu@@ fel@@ sk@@ irts , according to fires this type always spread out .
this problem comes to these problems that the website of the civil protection of Portugal on October 15 and 16 , had sought for information , or attempted to contact members .
it was a private initiative that provided the population with information : you used the own civil protection data using the application f@@ og@@ os.@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and the spread of fires .
the project was launched by the developers Jo@@ Ã£o P@@ ina in 2015 to simpli@@ fy the work of the fire brig@@ ade in October , so that the server followed the ons@@ lau@@ ght of 400@@ ,000 users who followed the fires , the website counted more than half a million .

exactly at this time A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province of G@@ ha@@ zn@@ i in central Mexico for the last time with his family at dinner together .
even if his mother didn &apos;t say that she didn &apos;t know that she would not see her son much longer - maybe even more .
the boy would break the boy in the morning .
his un@@ cle would recover him and bring him to the body .

Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of Haz@@ ara dominated by Haz@@ ara dominated by the Taliban were murdered by the Taliban , and many Haz@@ ara felt suddenly .
the Taliban went for their hat@@ red on Haz@@ ara @-@ known Taliban .
many Haz@@ ara left the country in direction Pakistan or Iran .
few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af found himself again in Pakistan .
a few years he worked in a coh@@ es@@ ru@@ be . the work was hard and made him sick .
then he took the what was left of his low wage , and went into Iran . once again he was once again in a foreign country along with other refugees and towing bags with mort@@ ars , the he@@ avier than he himself to earn his life .
at that time , the lives of Afghan refugees in Iran was character@@ ised by mis@@ ery and exploitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was really hard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; remin@@ ded A@@ shar@@ af in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we lived in an empty building on the building site , which we also worked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were no services and no heating . we hanged nylon in front of the open window , so that we are not refresh@@ ed at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left his life without papers in Iran and made himself ready for travel to Europe .
during the dangerous crossing on the sea he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and stran@@ ded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum request , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 .
some time was A@@ shar@@ af ob@@ hom@@ eless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that divided twice daily food to charity .
it is true that Italy is a second chance for asylum seek@@ ers in Italy . however , it is true that the conditions that apply to asylum seek@@ ers in the country .
the human rights organisation of Civil liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system is suffering under a general lack of transparency .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the vast majority of asylum seek@@ ers will be accommodated in more than 3000 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special recording centres . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ skilled and un@@ prepared staff . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Italian Law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be assigned to a recording centre , if they are officially given an application for asylum , which can still go off after registration of asylum applications .
until then , people who have no money to have accommodation , either on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street .
so it was A@@ shar@@ af .
but his un@@ mist@@ ress of life helped A@@ shar@@ af , soon out of these conditions .
after having made various work in the construction industry for several years , A@@ shar@@ k moved his entire creation in the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice .
this was so good that after a while still a second hostel and a speed was opened .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ at@@ is Succ@@ ess History is now a theme of the documentary &quot; handic@@ apped Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director Am@@ in Wah@@ id@@ i .
the film received the Venice City Award in 2017 , which has been awarded for the 24th time .

the conditions for entrepren@@ eurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
lots of bureau@@ cracy , high @-@ tax and conditions for loans are only some of the obstacles .
according to un@@ official estimates , approximately 20.000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them the country is a transition solution on the way to other European countries .
in the past few years , some of Afghanistan managed companies , including dres@@ s@@ als , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afghan restaurants even became praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ mad@@ i had the idea about his restaurant Oriental Experience , where the Kell@@ ner and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant is told by the various Afghan , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes the history of their journey to Italy .
the Afghan entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Padua as the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the p@@ izzeria Kab@@ ul@@ og@@ na in Bologna and a s@@ ushi Restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
A@@ shar@@ af@@ s aims to go beyond the Italian gastronom@@ ic industries and retail , and aim to return to the country that he had to leave to leave the teen@@ ager .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where a risk is , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I never forget my country and I can &apos;t live happy when I don &apos;t know that my people suffer .
I have a project for farmers from the p@@ oo@@ rest provinces of the country , especially for women .
they represent half of society and have to get the same possibilities as all others . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af Make plans to learn plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul , where people can sell their seri@@ ousness on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; he says .
the development of the successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through un@@ certainty and doub@@ ts , but at the end stand stability and pro@@ sper@@ ity .
A@@ shar@@ af has made this trip himself . now he wants to help others in this way .
