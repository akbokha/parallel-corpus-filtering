<seg id="1">Although I visited the USA since 2012 at least once a year, I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love to America is exceptionally great.</seg>
<seg id="4">As many of my generation I grew up with American movies, American writers will be read and operated by American music.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had a great profound effect on me that I was mainly based on an American film journalist.</seg>
<seg id="6">When the 14-year-old I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Granam in The Pelican letter, a fearless Reporter, who raised his interest in the Supreme Court with judges who wanted to occupy his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "free after Method Man," "" "it was if that is the absolute truth, forget all others that I would like to do with my life." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year that I lived in Arizona, had only intensified my admiration for the USA.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "I said," "" "America is the only country where I ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting, that you are always that you are, and it is easy to accept in a community of equal human beings." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">I had even written a very plain Liebesbrief about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me, as he goes with its commitment.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never stops away with his mind behind the mountain, as you say so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he thinks, like a former colleague it express, and publicly declared his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, AfroAmerican and Women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, people had to reacts on his statements and agreed in Schars for him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes which he won in the Republican elections, was the highest number that had been nominated by the party.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans that supported this biguous person, asked me?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not know Trump and his voters in line with people who I learned during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">As for example my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism program, which takes people from around the world, a deep faith man, with whom I could hold me about Islam and his past.</seg>
<seg id="23">Also voted by Peter Bhatia, the present editor of the "Cincinnati Inquirer, who is the present editor of the" Cincinnati Inquirer. "</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to watch the "Phoenix Suns" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trumps Intolerance is also in contrast to the generosity of movement that I struggling with Sandy Bahr, who fighting her life for the environment, and her husband Dave, my family, who treated me like their son.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even it fits to the engagement of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me with patience and wormwood, and helped my colleagues to get us to the complexity of the American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then there were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors who helped me a lot of my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "" "" "these people and those characterized by them perished my love to America." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump on his way to the nominated republican presidential data, they give me a stop and the counterpart of his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, it turned out that they were the exception of rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On 8 November 2016 there were over 50 million Americans, mostly white, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps because of his contempt against non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The confrontation with the idea that people voted for Trump, because they were either distributed to his racism and fanaticism, because they were ready to oversee these things, broke out almost the heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to describe Trump-voters as the bassist.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "the people said, one of my friends, is exactly what has led us to this situation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">That is superficial and respectless and indicates an inability to understand those who act on a different way and think.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows the people that their worries and fears about the hectic changes in their congregations will not be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters have voted for Trump, because they would like to rewin the control of a country, which they have disappointed?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they perhaps wanted to say that they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps too.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who commenting the cruel decision to collect a man who looks down with contempt on those who look different than he.</seg>
<seg id="41">This "Whitelash" (Anm.).: as much as "rejection of the White against all other ethnicities," The Word of white in Angle on the White and whiplash, which means as much as the big Van Jones called, has exactly what did America did so great.</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world estimate the American Ideal - no matter whether myth or reality, it is still a powerful idea - what faith or background you always like, America is called every welcome.</seg>
<seg id="43">Because this country chose his president twice the son of a Kenyaners whose history as he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible.</seg>
<seg id="44">With the election of Donald Trumps, there is a huge part of white America's promise and says: to Hell with versatility, religious freedom and the whole term of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In the America after 9 / 11 the white man is again at the Ruder, say.</seg>
<seg id="46">At all this I think at Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">At a rally for Hillary Clinton Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, had a place in your Americas?" he asked Mr. Khan.</seg>
<seg id="49">The multitude answered with a loud "No!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your United States?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" roar the amount.</seg>
<seg id="52">"have Latinos a square in your Americas?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered.</seg>
<seg id="54">Have Afro-American has a place in your Americas? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "" "" "they called them and their voices were killed." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "if someone, who is not so as you, have a place in your Americas?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a single and loud "NEIN"!</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan ended with the words: "God is thanks, Mr. Trump, isn't that your Americas." 36 hours later he has been corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The country, for which his son was fallen, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is now Trumps Land, told the message.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people that look like Mr. Khan, could not find no place in this new United States.</seg>
<seg id="62">And this is my heart.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero congregation in the province of Oaxaca, with the children of the paraguaic city of Cateura together?</seg>
<seg id="70">That the music played on both places, not only the life of the children has changed, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a great garbage dump, only 16 Kilometers south from Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial city, which is very popular among tourists, but worlds far from nearby preheated ruins and its world famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For some years now the La Banda de Música (Music bande) is now playing in the municipality: one of the children and an adult symphony orchestra, which has found a possibility of overcoming the surrounding poverty.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students is become a central interest for the municipality of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The church, which is located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for her drugs, abuse, and the gangs violence.</seg>
<seg id="77">However, this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot, who started a musical project and the youth offered a rare hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their obligations towards the music group very serious, the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:</seg>
<seg id="79">Once they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch, they run through the dust roads to reflect their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They are always busy and playing with shining eyes and play in the bustling day for day trumpet, trombone, Piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, Pauke, Bongos and the Conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from the garbage</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7.000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero play the children of Cateura - a village, that is practically on the largest garbage dump of Asuncion in the capital city - on instruments which are made of restored waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with restored instruments, which consist of local firm waste materials, made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura where the Recycler under management of Favio Chávez started to transform parts of the case in instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments imitate violin, viola, celli, double-basses, guitars, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and percussion instruments.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayische and Latin American music and music of the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra, etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article the Los Angeles Times Favio Chávez is reminiscent of a local eco-biologist and musician teacher of the children of Cateura, at the beginning time:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no room for rehearsals and we had to teach the parents in the garbage. the children knew not music and it was very difficult to contact parents, because many of them do not live with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed when Favio was shown something that he had never seen before: a violin made from waste.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today, there is a complete orchestra that plays for instruments made of recovered material and is called the Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentation of "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic garbage dump) shows the musical achievement:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world generates about one billion tons of rubbish each year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and of him are the offence - like people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they walk in something beauties.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra with its inspiring spectacle of garbage-to-music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra played his music even before Pope Francis:</seg>

<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine published by international, practiced solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">The re-release is happening within a agreement with Global Voices on the common use of content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa, it was known that this ship had already run illegitimate fishing waters before it had sought out the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">"" "" "" "the East African countries were brought to this way, and some inclined, a lawyer of this species to be called on their coasts." ""</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the compressors, Mozambique and the Seychelles mobilized quickly against the ship. they refused to condemn one of their harbours and refused to give him a fishing permit.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "" "" "the prime minister was surrounded by countries that you simply refused," "" "Benedict Kiilu, a leading employee of the Kenyan fishing authority." "" "he is part of a team that discovered the ship's time and followed." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013, the ship was driven out of the waters of the region: it was not succeeded to catch the fish.</seg>
<seg id="105">In the end, there was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia, due to pillaging the fish stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, the criminal practices and resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NRO Stop illegal Fishing (Illegal fishing).</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network are in addition to Somalia and Madagascar on six countries that had been displaced from their waters at that time.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "" "" "we have eight countries that are equivalent and work together." "" "Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trusts Project Ending illegally illegal. this project offers FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fisheries is unregulated by the definition: what is captivated, is hidden because it is extremely difficult to replace it. thus, Illegal Fisheries is a main cause of overfishing by regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">By the clear confusion of existing laws, by which certain habitats and species are to be protected, the illegal fishing ecosystems, which have a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">However, during the actions against illegal fisheries, by bureaucratic hurdle with the information between individual countries, these actions took place in real time, with traceable on FISH-i's digital communications platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There you can exchange the individual countries together for example lists of existent licenses, news to be suspected activities or details that you had experienced or experienced during a docking inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i persecuted the activities of ships also very attentive if these are moving along the open sea, using satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This allows to mark the authorities to mark ships, which seem to fish in prohibited areas - about such that a ship invites you to fish caught on other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such investigations may show whether the ships have a fishing licence, where they were on the road and possibly even if they have a criminal.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are opposed to illegal fish catch, can be refused on the basis of such ships in their harbours, which means that the ships could not be used to sell their cargo. and that they could even be compelled to the numbers of penalties, as in the case of the Premier.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "then there is considerable financial losses for the owners, which means the illegal fish catch is financially worthwhile." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">And that's what we want to achieve, "says Per Erik Bergh, Chief director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a Beraterina, supporting the fight against illegal fisheries in Africa and also FISH-i also supported.</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The already mentioned platform was created to win over 20 million USD in lost sales, who lose eight members of the network HISH-i every year due to illegal fishermen, penetrate in East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fish shops, essential for the region's commercial fish from around the world. also these illegal fishermen use it.</seg>
<seg id="122">These practices include actions like the sailing under false flag, counterfake license documents, indication of phasienamen, fishing protected species and fish areas.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "" "" "simply use the missing international cooperation and make the weaknesses of a non-neutral control system," "" "says Long." "" "could not let a ship illegally fishing and a land could say '" "" "You must not let my harbour." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="124">"" "but another country could say 'Comm to me'." "" "and precisely this legale hatch is trying to close FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="125">So far the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception FISH-i was involved in more than 30 studies.</seg>
<seg id="127">It was criminal networks uncovered, the counterfeit licenses in Tanzania had discovered. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and found it-volatly ships and found it.</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to his co-operation with Interpol, the international authority on combating crime, FISH-i can share information on illegal fisheries across large distances and preserved.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "" "" "some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="130">It builds a system that can help FISH-i to be suspected ships more precise.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which has always been developed further, helps to hide illegal ships.</seg>
<seg id="133">"the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position." says Duncan Copeland, Head analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, a NRO, which deals with fishing data and FISH-i technical support.</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships can switch to its automatic identification systems, where they can no longer be changed by satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland helps to build a system that combines various information on each other. FISH-i help to find criminal ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But FISH-i's team of African nations can actually take effect on the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fisheries?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, Skywards recently opened the platform Global Fishing Watch: a platform that offers satellite data, and through which the position of each individual traceable ship can be displayed worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "in order to get a better picture in order to get a better picture of it," "" "he says," "" "he says." "" "here is a chance for countries to help themselves and to bundle their resources for the investigation." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "" "" "we should do this at global level." "" "Pew Charitable Trusts has a similar project to run on which a global system has the persecution of ships." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities did not only feel crime, but also to relocusts.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that previously exploited without license and barely possible to reckon with consequences, we know that they will be observed.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the FISH-i participating countries have meanwhile a 33% increase in fishing investments, since then fishing boats could buy more licences.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i Somalia had helped Greko 1, the inspectors found there on board locks, whose use is prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"" "other countries notice that success." "" "the effect is therefore strongly, that we also copy other countries," "" "says Kiilu." "" "we have become a study object." "" "in West Africa, several hundred million dollars annually killed by illegal fisheries." ""</seg>
<seg id="148">There are six countries together, to the so-called West Africa Task Force. also, the Illegal Fisheries, according to exactly the same model like FISH-i. "with safety, the aim is to emerge even more such initiatives and structures even in other regions," says Copeland.</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently, FISH-i's most recent member country asked his first major triumph in October: in October, Greko 1, a ship that was travelling under false flag and were not only used to drive trapple networks, which are now prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="150">The ship was still soaked in banned waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia. "" "" take a strong sign that they go against illegal fish catch, "" "" Bergh. "" "</seg>

<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father to view the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentine city of Cordoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">As now, Quijano said in the context of the large La Perla-Ribera's trial in the province of Cordoba against his father.</seg>
<seg id="201">In the process that ended on 24 August 2016, crimes were investigated, which have committed during the Argentinean military dictatorship.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano have not found his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Starting at the Bürde, same names as his father bear to the brutal military operations in the prison La Perla, which he observed at the age of 15, he has suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">For 34 years he held the family secret for himself.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation it was, I thought that was fine.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret magician.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child with 15 years you do not notice that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">I could not know that my father was a thief, Folder and Murderer.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis had no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was Gendareriebeamter. during the Argentinean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a period of statescalism, was his father from 1976 to 1978, had been deputy chief of Intelligence 141 in the prison La Perla.</seg>

<seg id="215">From the Sports Hall to the military base</seg>
<seg id="216">When my father started to take me to the military base, I often went to the sports hall. there I went up with a boy who made the fight sport.</seg>
<seg id="217">All they called it "Kent."</seg>
<seg id="218">I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black-and-white photo and called me to identify my boyfriend.</seg>
<seg id="219">He said:</seg>
<seg id="220">You are a dickhead, you are pleased with one of the ERP.</seg>
<seg id="221">Pass only that they don't carry you a day, and I must save you.</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide distribution of translation defects are diverse.</seg>
<seg id="377">For example, you are needed to understand two important abilities: passive language skills to understand the output text and active language skills to transmit him into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active rule of the target language - something that is in the native language. generally, translators shall be in the target language - not in the language language - not in the language language - native language.</seg>
<seg id="379">So, a French mother language should translate from the English into French - not from French into English.</seg>

<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies employ no staff with English as a native language that could translation translations into English. this may have a lack of understanding for Excel, cost-reasons or the relatively small number of English speakers that speaks Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies that have no foreign employees have to make translation work together. then the Japanese employees, whose English is the best inscribed, translators - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really good.</seg>

<seg id="384">Machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The worrentioned phrases that arise from mechanic translations, show that this technique can replace another human translators. this applies to some languages.</seg>

<seg id="544">At the beginning of March 2017, the daily newspaper Kahoku Shimpo, the progress made in the northeast of Japan were affected by the "Thirty catastrophe" of March 2011. a massive earthquake, an tsunami and an atom accident in Fukushima had triggered the catastrophe.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung is located in Anai, which lies in the Prefecture of Miyagi prefecture. Miyagi prefecture of Miyagi prefecture in Japan. the Prefecture of Miyagi was to experience both the earthquake and the resulting tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbor of Fukushima and Iwate were forced, because the tsunami had vanished from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">Even for this, the Fukushima prefecture had experienced a nuclear accident, even so alone, 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their houses.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows the progress made from local view which have been achieved six years later to rebuild the life of local companies.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper includes both statistics of Japanese rebuilding authority as well as survey results of the affected themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">The housing estate in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung reports that 77 per cent of the planned spare parts (the world's planned spare part), Miyagai kouei juutaku) in the prefectures Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate were finished.</seg>
<seg id="552">Miyagi's greatest success could be found in Miyagi's three prefectures, 80 percent of the planned spare parts were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 per cent of such houses, whereas Fukushima remains the final light after Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="554">Nevertheless, six years after the catastrophe, evacuated by accommodation in the catastrophe, evacuated by Behel-contracted juutaku) in final spare parts.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the Thirty catastrophe, almost 80 000 people were forced to live in accommodation at home.</seg>
<seg id="556">Still 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate still lived in such services.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 per cent of the Fukushima happened in the evacuation of Fukushima. more than 75 per cent of the evacuation that were evacuated after the disaster in accommodation, were settled in final homes.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate the number is 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three affected prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">Like the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung, 1074 of 1100 schools have been affected by the calamity, opened its doors to December 2016, which makes nearly 98 percent of schools of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, the industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures are far more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While nearly 100 per cent of fisheries airports in Iwate and Miyagi are back into operation, only 30 percent of fishing ports have been reopened their operation in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and nuclear accident, took place in the three prefectures agricultural land large area.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi could restore 93 percent of its agricultural land, only 66 percent of the farmland in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed the farmland in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this is just a result of atomic fact, because only 690 hectares of vineyards destroyed the farmland of Fukushima, in the nuclear sector. "</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures, tourism has once again recovered, but there remains Fukushima far back.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist figures in Miyagi and Iwate are back up to 90 percent on the same stand as before the disaster. Fukushima however can only have 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung reports that since the disaster has almost half of the coastal towns, it is more difficult to earn their habit.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population prepared for the next big earthquakes?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to determine the overall image, the newspaper introduced numerous surveys under the local population and under the evacuated population. she asked them about the state of rebuilding and also how their receiving can be changed across the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction of the article the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo led a survey conducted by more about the tsunami consciousness among the native population of experience.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey carried out that 83.1 percent of resident population have taken hold, to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of respondents say that still not enough in catastrophes prevention has been done.</seg>
<seg id="575">As it stands for those who had to evacuated from the Fukushima Prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">In its issue on the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has strengthened their attention to the situation of evacuated Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima had not only had to experience the devastating earthquake and devastating tsunami, no, the prefecture of Fukushima was also a witness of the worst, disastrous accident in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="578">Nearly 63 000 people were moved from Fukushima region, nearly 63 000 people were moved outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016, some more than 23 000 people were settled back to Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="580">After 2017, still 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima still live in their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">Most of the evacuations are most of the evacuations, which still are still in behaviourers, because the efforts are competing for the reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima. this is a building projects that are part of the Olympic Games in Tokyo by 2020.</seg>

<seg id="637">The sugar cane industry resistor already the plagues, the fall of Socialism, the low market prices, the ill-efficiency, the poor management decision and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016, the production was 1.6 million tons of sugar, less than 1910 produced.</seg>
<seg id="639">The message would have been a motive for some decades ago, but the bad ones have already been no new.</seg>

<seg id="643">The reduction of the sugar tube industry was an economical necessity: the 155 sugar tubes factories were technically obsolete, and hardly competitive they were incarable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to concentrate on the most efficient factories, the annual production target was 4 million tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories that can produce sugar for maximum 4 Centavos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motifs that led to such measures were the low productivity of the sugar cane plantations and the future rise in the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless, the sugar price increased from about a decade.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025, the prize of unrefined sugar between the ages of 15 and 16 Centavos must remain, according to the report, "Agricultural Working Perspectives" by the OECD and FAO, the Agriculture and Food Organization of the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current production would achieve the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), the raw sugar would generate about $85 million for the country.</seg>

<seg id="1136">Can there be a possibility to enter here and now despite a language barrier to someone with someone?</seg>
<seg id="1137">Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the initiative Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS) is the number of stories in their original language a possible response.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported a short initiative by Steven Bird, the Unnegotiable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">However, the focus of TLS is not on the written, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to obtain the language variety of great cities and to digitiate.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in Oakland, where TLS has already been carried out since 2015, the risk that small and not so small languages are not given to the sole born babies.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the makers of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass mortality of the world can be avoided, if we are cities, we accept cities - safe spaces, in which inhabitants are not forgotten, who are to be dazzling.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "while" "" "hearing are often connected to understand" "" "these events instead" "" "to feel good to feel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, storytellers set their history first in their own language and translate or explain it in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are no professional storytellers, their devotion, and their presentation, we carry out the hearing aid.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They call laughter and emotions, when the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">For example, the following video shows a traditional story from Burkina Faso, which is told in the language Dafing. during this round, the storyteller Rassidatou also attacks the opportunity to explain their country of typical customs of knowledge.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event, John Nyamusara tells the move from the bunnies and the Pabound in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">After having declared the importance of his Fak, John Nyamusara is asked: "how is this to speak to an audience what your language does not understand?" with a broad grinsen he divides his feeling of insivity:</seg>
<seg id="1150">They have heard!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were all with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">So far, the events of Treasure Language Storytelling have taken place in three cities, and the organizers hope to expand this. all those who are inspired by the project can come into contact with TLS in order to organize their own storytellers.</seg>

<seg id="1155">The aim of a re-audit of the public debt of Puerto Rico, which took over 72 million US dollars, participated in the capital building of the capital, and ran until the Plaza de Colón in the old town of San Juans.</seg>

<seg id="1187">The book that was published in the last year and is licensed here and contains a number of inserts that deal with free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a tribute to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it is:</seg>
<seg id="1190">"" "" "" "this book would like to be rebuilt as movements for free knowledge and what the true cost is to which this is connected." ""</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developer, researchers and authors who have involved in the movements of Free knowledge, page have worked on page to create about the nebula who gives us to create our newsfeeds and to create something sense from our various experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to liberate Basle Khartabil, beloved and celebrated Internet volunteers, who has been detained in Syria since 15 March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was cancelled from the list of Adra prison in which he sat on 3 October 2015.</seg>

<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title Collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice that want to release on his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom.</seg>
<seg id="1196">To see how Bassel has a high price for his participation in a free culture, has many of us to start thinking about their own destinies, acts and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why Are We Here?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What have we decided?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we abandoned in this process by means of extreme beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The Web developer for open source and digital activist has been in custody of Syrian government agencies since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015 Bassel was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military institution, transferred to an unknown location.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the "Military Police Bassel reported on the basis of a" strictly prohibited "held command from his cell in Adra."</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that it was contacted on 12 November 2015 by people who were presented itself as the insider of the Assad government and set them out of a alleged death sentence against her husband.</seg>

<seg id="1205">A pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, played a crucial role in it to expand access to the Internet and to know about public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, Technologist, and currently crossing the head of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps there was none of the Bassels cultural prototypes as the work that he began with a group of archaeologist and 3D artists around 2005 to reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyras.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites of the world, was the way of numerous civilizations, and melt Greek-Roman architecture types with hiesful traditions and personal influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">Bassel could not know that ten years after he began working with this work, the IS would make everything that architecture, which embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This stamp to the digital archaeology and the conservation has created a time capsule created for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future of uninvaluable value.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Typically, Bassel could not close this project before.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I have spent my whole life to dream and dream, and he taught me to slay them.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel brought me in English, even when he was already in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I learned to read in English, I have learned to write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He always has always shared his knowledge with every one that has asked. he has taught others to read English, to write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened my gate to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also taught others, as they use computer, at least theoretically, without knowing in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (waiting), a trial which she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015, when he was in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura have worked together in the book for a year.</seg>

<seg id="1254">Mosambique: due to corruption Verurge director after adherence to previous post.</seg>
<seg id="1255">Mozambique responded with anger on a corruption of corruption in which a government member returned to the workplace in the state of state, which was committed to corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1256">This is the Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and joined together with four other accused of 54 million metical (roughly 800 000 Euro) for 22 years imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money originates from public funds in the airports of Mozambique, their council Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 for good leadership and immediately requested his return to the company what happened on April 19.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a statement by the General Prosecution of the Republic, there was no obstacle course for Cambaza, returned to his old post as the company moved a disciplinarian method after his imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many inhabitants are not hot.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The Centre of Public Integrity (Centro de Budade Pública, shortly CIP), a local institution that sets themselves to public transparency, condemned in an interview with the German wave decision of the company to relocate the director:</seg>
<seg id="1262">Represents a setbacks in the fight against corruption and clarifies the lack of transparency and is even a step in regard to the efforts of our legal system, so the CIP.</seg>
<seg id="1263">"" "" "" "what we regard to knowledge, the company also should have a disciplinable process against the resistances." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1264">The company looks silent, but does not affect adequate legal steps for the use of the respective functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">Egídio Vaz, a significant voice in the Mosambique social media, refuses this behaviour as well as "contradiction":</seg>
<seg id="1266">When Cambaza was a competent type, he would have been a consultant after having been sentenced to a prison sentence and had to eat half.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could pay paid talks and motivating speeches, he could advise and his image polishing.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is uncompetent, he has refused to be reintegrated into the company which he helped his damage.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore it is obvious: Cambaza will be paid for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Contradiction!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil says the director does not include any Moral:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza from the state to be rewarded, because he doesn't believe him, could not believe someone this way that the state has already undergone massively.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza is missing the Moral to serve and serve the state, * he already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead of being operated on the state instead.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza was used to state the state as handy for an inexhaustible money source and the state itself, this man was tired, the pre-loaded and finally was sentenced to a long prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly I don't know why this man was rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey Zeúte is preferred to remember the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel, remember that a thief has been in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Thieves do not belong to the prison of Samora Machel, the Mozambique will not only remain forever as the first independent president, but also as a sharp, slitting and - by saying, prophetical Redner.</seg>
<seg id="1278">One of his most illustrious representations was, as he confirmed that "an ambitious man is able to sell his ambitions for his ambitions, to sell his own individual interest."</seg>
<seg id="1279">Samora said: "I don't know if a ambitious man changes, my experience shows that it is not so. he changes the tactic, but he turns not from his ambitions.</seg>
<seg id="1280">An ambitious man is criminal criminally. "</seg>
<seg id="1281">In Twitter the reactions were also leaning:</seg>
<seg id="1282">Cambaza was sentenced to 22 years in prison, he sat down for 10 years and came free.</seg>

<seg id="1289">According to information from Facebook users in Myanmar, the known social network took their postal from the net because they contained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although the source of the word is still discussed, it is normally used to refer to humans in Indian origin or in general as adjective "Indisch."</seg>

<seg id="1292">During the past few years, the ascent of radical nationalist movements has given an extremely abdomination Konnotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that usually used by ultra-nationalists in Hasselt against Muslims who represent a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in the effort to fight against Hasselt in Myanmar, the company has made a lot of sensued content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar's are normally to be associated with racism, but the word on itself is not calling for Hasselt.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that, in which they discussed the use of the Word, or doubts to the use of his use, were censored.</seg>
<seg id="1297">In addition there are several burmesic words with basic meanings that have the same book sequence such as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, chair at Burmese also wrote 'Kalar htaing' written what the same letter contains, as well as other words like 'Kalar pae' (camel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebooking Aung Kaung Myat explained the various meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of my friends was deleted today because he contained the Word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he had asked his friends on the spiritual way if it could weave how he could lint his back pain, saying a word game.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The set ku la - "healing" (ku) + the question word (la) to Burmese - resembles the racist expression, but the context is completely different.</seg>

<seg id="1304">Zin Win is the opinion that she will reduce Hasselt radicaler nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook analytic would be able to spread out all the Posts, which in suspicion hours, racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook deletes the word "Kalar" not manually.</seg>

<seg id="1310">The good thing is that this three-piece nationalists will spread the Hasselt, a rather good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action plan to send a strong signal to all of the Hasselt, the efficiency of this strategy is not able to keep the efficiency of this strategy.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and Wechat have proven that the censorship of impact often are often going to start with social networks, a new word or an alternative writing of the censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">"" "the author Aung Kaung Myat described as Facebook began to delete his postal, when he would only express his friends," "" "the word" "" "Kalar 'is exiled by the social network:" ""</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I was attentive to this new directive on Facebook, I made a post to inform my Facebook friends that the Word is closed.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my post office was removed from Facebook and it became liken, post and parts of content for 24 hours, because the post "factual community does not cause the" Facebook community standards. "</seg>

<seg id="1319">Post without Hassell from Facebook.</seg>

<seg id="1323">Such words can be used only more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">In addition, it seems to have this without any local context or technical support, and have banned the words like "chair" or "peancurry".</seg>

<seg id="1376">Prior to months, Maharaj hasn't announced his intention to conduct judicial steps, should the law be adopted, and he seems to redeem his promise.</seg>

<seg id="1395">Students as well as reporters and fans of TV series are against the blocking.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many technicians are used, changing tools for blocked websites (a current article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has not seen the third largest VPN prevalence in the world), most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been closed since 2008 in a published report by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University has been held, regular blockings of the internet has been adopted since 2007 after the Internet Act (No. 5651) was adopted.</seg>

<seg id="1399">While the platform remains closed, several Mirror pages (pages which are reflected the content of Wikipedia and often updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform laid down all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized Peer-to-peer network (so computer calculator), which is not based on the system of domain name and thus makes a complete censorship difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">"" "the content is activated despite the prohibition." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a Blogmail report IPFS reported about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After we have heard the messages (over the blocking of Wikipedia), we were able to put snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. the possibility to read the content on decentralized and distributed ways.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to see at least all Wikipedia content, even if it can not reach the website www.wikipey.org.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also provided that this step is independent of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it was merely a screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other effort to handle the sperm.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consoli of Wikimedia Italy has both tr.vikiansicyclopedi.org, an open source project, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that everyone can use similar to Mirror Pages, when in the country of Wikipedia are blocked.</seg>

<seg id="1410">One attacks on another URL, which is not the original. that what you see, is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Essentially, the server leads the request to the right Wikipedia page, so it is possible to see the content of Wikipedia itself when they are blocked in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1417">Sascha Giri was with the photos that he looked around, never satisfied. they were wished with poorly positioned motifs and balanced colors.</seg>
<seg id="1418">That motivated him to wear a camera with themselves and try to grab the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">At that time he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, SUSS is trying to bring Nepals, Nepals wildlife to the international stage.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his home town next to Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos, which guides the attention to Nepals wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">Described on Facebook as he described this first class location with his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of the Chitwan National Park, a world heritage. what could it be better for a passionate game of wildlife!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I felt right at home when I suddenly called Navaraj (the manager of Chitwan Gaida Lodge). he had received a call from my father to be on the bank of the Rapti river on the bank of the Rapti river.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river damm is only a few minutes away from the tourist village Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I was running with my camera and was there in few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river where the Leopard was located and I immediately started to kneeling pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sascha aims to obtain collaboration with the authorities to obtain worldwide recognition of Nepals nature and would like to understand the understanding that raw animals are not as furious, as they look like.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know it; because he stood up Tigers from face to face toward this:</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger is not disturb in the opinion of sheep not at bedtime!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late evening. light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleeping time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">I was also because of darkness on the way to home, when suddenly the King of the bush appeared immediately. he sat immediately, we will see and starred me through the Sal-trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals, SUSS the logo "I click for Conservation (lit.: I clicked for Environmental Protection) on his photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">However, his passion for the promotion of Nepals and wild animals is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days, and mostly lived in a tent, to make up at the Bardia National Park recordings of Otters. up to 12 days, it took up a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds, which live near the tourist accommodation.</seg>

<seg id="1470">A revised version was again published as part of a Content Sharing Convention.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of Indian women avoid women with greatest care, the names of their husbands or even by older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead, they use a nonomic or say "father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chavisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh give women to respect the husband because of the social pressure, as well as fear of the consequences, they should have violate the standard that practice this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year Malati Mahatoto was condemned by the Indian state of Otha by a pseudo-war crimes and chased out of their family and the village community, after having addressed a married relatives with names.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of tradition also did not call their wives, also among men, is also among men. however, they have far less conceptions to fear, if at all, they should not follow this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health staff, as well as household stuff, a unique club, and were thus fast to the main focus of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them alone to discuss and discuss the hostile of patriarchal.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of 56 clubs, which is in 13 Indian states, it is part of the campaign # Khelbadal, which is operated by the Community's Video Volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Paworked for seven years with the help of their video camera on the discovery of practices, such as children's marriage until the association of HIV- and AIDS-Inks, and directs these clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">It reports about how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time at the ambassador of the wall.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video, the Rohini showed in its discussion round, did not call women who call her husbands in the name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She decided to opt for this topic, because she wanted to open the conversation about the patriarchate with a problem with which the women can identify slightly.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The names of their husbands do not need to discuss, there is a broader, which they plexed to all duties and never have been questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini means:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not keep it, is considered a back as a woman without Moral.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never made us up to this discussion round thoughts.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini wanted to have never called her husband, previously called by the name, try out at home, as it runs.</seg>
<seg id="1489">They showed the video of the discussion round their husband and mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells about:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother in law and my husband still weigh long after the video was at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"" "Prakash, my husband, turned to me, saying," "" "I should call him from now on his name." ""</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this self-confidence in the luggage, Rohini started her first discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "Patriarchate" never before. some believed that there was a good thing because it meant that the younger members would be protected from a family, especially girls and women.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection the women tried to bring discussion with an exercise in motion.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini bat any participant in the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, offended, sad, loving, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">"" "then said they all," "" "If we cannot tell the name of our husbands," "" "but they can call us as they could not respect us?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equal? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"" "" "" "some of these women have been married since 30 years, and this was the first day that they brought the name of their husbands on the lips" "" "says Rohini Paarashtra over the Brechen of a centuries of old traditions, in which women married the name of their husbands ever." ""</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells about:</seg>
<seg id="1502">"" "" "" "a woman was so shy, that, while the whole exercise was just outside the whole exercise; a other decided to settle the whole frustration against him and his family, taking him cursed." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think it will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Even in the Adrenalinfrenzy, with an ancient bridge, the women decided that they were actually trying to call her husbands in the name.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next days Rohini received a number of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she sat among women in the head: his wife could not stop his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it with dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law she was afraid, she was afraid, saying that it was an error.</seg>
<seg id="1511">"" "another woman said," "" "Rohini said," "" "I should do it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of participants in attendance was less understandable and the situation was arted in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports, such as women tried to stop other practices, such as the Tracking of the zinnored dot at the forehead, shows the status status:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why must only women show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband, that I would bear the zinnored dot when he would like it.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only and I listened to him to carry him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women have not heard completely, but mine, they are now in a better position, even to choose him on some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the Discussion Papers b is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"we are doing an excursion on every discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "I don't want to make women make women, who could hear what" "" "says it." ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last few months, they celebrated their own birthdays with cake, and they danced and sang, and talked about things, which they never did beforehand.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini is saying:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems since so many years now and I have been associated with some things, for example how our identity are linked to our husbands, never as honest.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to say that certain things can tell you, no matter how small they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round we have underneath the concept of honor and is connected to the clothing.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only been borne by Saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most of them is okay, but some wanted to have a salad-Kurta, a wide shirt of a bunny, they have not dreamed.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After much argument and discussion on the advantages of their own hangers, the morally connected with Saris and much more, tastes of her own pairs of Kurtas (upper inhibit) into a discussion round, so that women could bear them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next, they decided to plan to plan a trip to Goa, where they can bear Jeans and Rohini is sure that they will be able to create it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question, whether in the five months since its first review, Rohini confirms that the things slowly emerges slowly into the rolls:</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have made only small steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tested it a few times, but then heard it again to say the name of her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some that included me, but only if they are alone and no other family members are present.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two will continue to say the names of their husbands; only one or two women now wear Zinnoberred on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in discussion db know that the changes that they would like to reach more freedom of movement or their own hangers - at the end of a difficult to navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">"" "" "" "having confidence in each other self-confidence, will be aware of them in the same boat." ""</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explained:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Every one of us is a Victims of Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"" "" "" "but the club there is confidence of us, that will change anything." ""</seg>

<seg id="1684">The question may be dumm, since Singapore is recognized as an independent state.</seg>

<seg id="1686">This remark has triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting on the meeting of a meeting of the State of the State of New York, the Minister noted that many people criticises the dominance of the only political party of Singapore as compared to Singapore with other countries.</seg>

<seg id="1696">It was so volcanic, it had the calls of a escape before the responsibilities, a mandatory violation.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, whose land is it?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons led by Shanmugam were not very Nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', in view of what, it appeared insoftened.</seg>
<seg id="1699">In contrast, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities which are permanently managed by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Once you reach the core point of the River Thas, the good old Leier of the authoritarian seizures, which predict Democrats, leaving logic, because it fits better to their power.</seg>

<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng requires Shanmugam to illustrate his opinion, because they did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>

<seg id="1898">On the way of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America, some places are known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tapachula where he is located at the border with Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is directed by a 59- year-old Mexican woman, a small woman with a coral pink Brillenframe and gold-coloured earrings in teddy dynasty shape.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called Concepción González Ramírez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many under the name Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is the fact that the hotel (or rather she) has become a goal for Africans and Haitians who are on the passage.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about 2,50 dollar the night sleeping guests can sleep in simple rooms, with grinding, brushed walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the entrance, there is a parrots in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - yet hundreds of African and haitian migrants are here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, Ms. Ramírez told the people in full small busses and from the upper part of the coast to call: "Mama Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you mum Africa? "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At the moment it is rather quiet but in this year Ramírez has received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have also slept outside on cardboard.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She would not refuse to refuse.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them, and brings them to the hospital if they are sick, they buys them medicines that they can't pay them, massaging them with a balm away from the long journey.</seg>

<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister, who hopes to go to Boston to get there her husband and three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">They already lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans, which are on the way into the United States, normally a first stop in South America and then go towards the north.</seg>
<seg id="1925">The family had heard of other starters from Mama Africa. "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the route," explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti.</seg>
<seg id="1926">It tells that Haitians and Africans often travel together the tour and that Afrikaner would speak to Whatsapp by Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">As many of its approach, Michelet lived in Brazil before and worked as a construction worker on building sites of the Olympic Games and the FIFA World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When Brazilian economy has been weaker, he has started his journey into the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest of Mama Africa since months: it sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the Busticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will contact Ms Ramírez in the future.</seg>

<seg id="1932">Ms. Ramírez tells you that their guests have often send text messages, if they have continued to visit her, or to report about the course of their journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">It explains that her Christian faith is the propulsion of their work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">They don't know much about Africa but their guests have taught chicken as in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Ms. Ramírez is perhaps known here, but it is not the only radio hope for migrants who travel through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The other end of the city leads a blind alley to Jesús Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">This winter is Valenzuela and his family of migrants in their small house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is policeman and has found that the Busts will be sold to numerous African migrants.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He began to help them to get a reasonable price, then he has offered them his house for one dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment 25 people, mainly Haitians are mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleeping on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking place outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests do.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"" "" "" "I lived in the United States," "" "he says." "" "I have experienced what they can experience." ""</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border via the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others not help. this is the reason why I give them my support. "</seg>
<seg id="1946">After he lived for three years, he was transferred to the United States after a raid on his work office.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants who travels across Tapachula, comes from Central America, other inhabitants also open the doors of their houses for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children, who wanted to press the money from him, without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula he asked for a accommodation and an unknown, a sole owner, has offered her roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later, the family lives and try to decide where the next steps should go.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back to the house of Mama Africa is all full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the steps you consult the travel quiet their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A small bus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests, most of Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Ms. Ramírez appears happy about that her house is full, but it is also nostalgia, because of those who have gone away.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother, she blamed her album with numerous photos.</seg>

<seg id="1961">The inhabitants of Xinjiang, a ethnic minority region in the West of China, are forced to install a Spyware on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On 10 July, the mobile users received a mobile telephone notification in the Tianshan district of Urumqi, in which it exhibits the District Government to install an surveillance app named Jingwang (or "Web-cleaning").</seg>

<seg id="1964">But kòs the app also use the app for more than combating terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to a exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women have been arrested in autonomous Ili Kazakh Prefecture because they had replaced the app, news with a private Wechat group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the communication of the police, the app the sources and the distribution paths of terrorists would follow, along with "illegal religious" activities and "harmful information" including videos, pictures, ebooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is the block pornographic websites, from online fraud, trousers and Phishing pages to make users to make attention online, how much time they spend online, and to control the own home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with filters for minors is to help the children to develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can be used in a diverse way.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "Remote Actors" or even hacker may be able to manipulating the home network of a person or steal therefrom.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is consistent with other measures to control the digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While notifications of digital censorship in China are mostly concentrated on the experiences of users in the eastern and south, the reality is very often dim for those who live in remote-known ethnic minority regions like Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">To limit unrest and dissatisfaction in conflict areas, the authorities are often arrange extreme censors and monitoring measures as well as routinely internet off.</seg>
<seg id="1976">This is based on Twitter based media outlet "Images from the Republic of China" (suspicious English), the censored news in China, showed photos from a Checkpoint, to the policemen the inhabitants randomly presented whether they had the surveillance app had been installed.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian ensure that people are using the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification demanded that people install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you find at a Checkpoint with a device without these software, they could be imprisoned for up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They forced the people to use devices that are intended for elderly people.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The Jordanian Rapper Emsallam Hdaib speaks about the rights of the LGBTQ + community, free expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib takes most of its time in the most of its time. sometimes he slotted to his screen, once again his computer, and again to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what can you leave, there is a cigarette between his fingers or with nicotine spotted lips.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the top of his family house which had been part of them since 1967; the year, in which Israel had completed his occupation of the West Bank and had been forced to escape from their village in Palestine (about: Farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For now six years, Hdaib is an passionate active activist, who was transferred to the conservative majority against gender roles, sexuality and free expression through art and rapes.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which often sets out often with topics such as Oriental, racism and the situation of Palestinian geographer, but also calls for the core of the entire Arab world. all these topics do not find only in cities in Amman, from Damascus until the whole of Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With his 25 years, Hdaib sees itself as someone who is not limited by limits, and he can feel according to his own statement with people who suffer under the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he doesn't open it, he stimulates the US foreign policy against the US foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib considers his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib doesn't believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in warfare, anything which was born with his identity as "Palestinian Gevolateter of the second generation," even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"" "" "" "I don't think because of my own life," "" "emphasises Hdaib." ""</seg>
<seg id="2104">"" "then he adds:" "" "I think, because I am a man," "" "while it is dissolved in water, the holy month Ramadan. in this time it is intended for Muslims to fasten from sunrise until sundown." ""</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee at a sensually called Junction will be little with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically the pieces of warm coffee and the cocktails of the Kent cigars in the nose into first line of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes, Jordan feels like a prison in the free sky, especially if you have a glance into the neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Therefore it avoids it easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ramadan of water - to wear not in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs adopted a show of the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some parliamentary elections which support the Islamic action front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual frontsman Hamed Sinno, says the cultural and traditional norms of the country, and the main reason for the concert news.</seg>
<seg id="2112">"" "the members and former spokeswoman of the Islamic Coalition DIMA Tahboub said in an interview with CNN, that the concert" "" "was cancelled due to sexual orientation of the singer." ""</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many claim also, the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab spring, human rights and free expression of opinion in the Arab world is dangerous activism, who exhibits the ancient legitimacy of authoritarian regimes in the entire region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou'Leila rated the jordanian people as a "progressive supporters of human rights" which continued to use "for an intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement is probably not simply silky rhetoric, but actually a clear-crystalline reality in Jordan was clearly reflected in Hdaibs's work.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In the year 2016, Hdaib traditional Gender norms formed by his vision formed by the fate of Arabic women to have sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of a obviously adorned woman whose arms and legs can stretch up to the corners of the screen.</seg>
<seg id="2118">She is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of innumerable women who lost their lives through the hands of them, they actually should trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">In the past few years, Jordan has increased the number of 'honorary moral' - the inofficial outside.</seg>
<seg id="2120">According to Human Rights Watch, the number of Honor in 2016 reached its high point; however, Jordan was still missing in order to support the institutional infrastructure to prevent women, victims attempted murder or domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law on the fragile conflict in 1954, women who are exposed to the danger of inward family, "and for their release, often a year-long bureaucratic expenditure as well as the guarantee of the family is necessary that the woman will happen nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Also Hdaibs music enjoys great popularity and is known to return to the themes in his country for long as tabu.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib assert that his work is politically, but dreamed that he can split his music, the full of exportite attacks on sexuality, freedom and expression of expression, not from politics.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, husband.</seg>
<seg id="2125">He became a policy of politics, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed" takes Hdaib the question after the Palestinian identity.</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and in "Ghareeb" the focus will focus on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs which are politically active in the core of political.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016, Hdaib published a song with the title "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse repeat itself:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is it."</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the further course of the songs, Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market, in which one can get in his words, "what you want" - be faith or non-believe, heterogeneity or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He noticed that hardly any one speaks in Jordan on the rights of gay men and lesbians, and that comments on the equality of LGBTQ + individuals can be censored in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014 Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular jordanian Onlineprogram Roya, to notice later that his comments were torn from context, and in his opinion was censored.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"" "" "" "on Youtube, it was uploaded to Youtube without cuts, but only a revised version," he says. "" "</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib advertises the Arab LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that intolerance against homosexuals not disagree to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentioned Abu Nudas, a poet of the eighth century, who still has stayed in memory thanks to its homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks: if Abu Nuevo should work on behalf of the potassium, in the eighth century openly could write about homosexuality, why is Jordanian this?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled, to do.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashemian kingdom there is nothing new, that the government attacks on the free expression of opinion, and the progressive voices will be brought to silence.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian news ordered several former government officials and members of the lecturban, with the grounds that they had criticized on comments in social media to assemble with the deep in the land root corruption.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view, however, the concert of Hdaibs is only the tip of the iceberg - the actual challenge is to be a structural change in the next generation of the Jordan.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him, Mashrou'Leila is now forged for him for the second time, but the way of progress - so it looks like a slow, bedtime and internal changes. it is sure that these changes from day to day in the heart of the Jordanian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Finally, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabians also, of an Arab world without interventions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">He doesn't only dream of it, his work up to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to experience it. "</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps, the region will help the help of music, art and literature of a real and basic openness - and not through bombs, streetitions and artificial sort of guided democracy. at least he hopes it.</seg>
<seg id="2147">So far as far as far, Hdaib will continue to continue, and also resistance to resist.</seg>

<seg id="2170">At the same time Peru - as many other Central and South American countries - a rising demand for aesthetic services to men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, the appearance and the unusual hairstyle of famous athletes like Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Chile), Pedro Gallese (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Peru), has led to do more normal citizens into the experienced hands of hairdressers that can reproduce these elaborate hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairstyles, which go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity, has even inspired an annual event, the contest of hairdressers "Batalla de Barberos" which has been taking place since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">There are experts from each other to show who can see from them the eccentric Looks, as you can see in the following video (other videos on current competitor can be found on the public Facebook-profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>

<seg id="2181">"" "the following article is the revised version of" "" "Liebesbotancies" "", "which has published the international online magazine Tea After Twelve." ""</seg>
<seg id="2182">The contribution is published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we write only love letters to people who know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not much more important, people who feel unwashed, affection?</seg>
<seg id="2185">Exactly this question was the two young Colombian activists from the Foundation BogotArt and Cristian Palacios by the Young-Youth Foundation, and inspired them to the campaign cartas por la Reconciliación (Letters to Reconciliation), to write young people, guerrilla fighting letters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">It was just short before a short time, her country had to contribute to their part: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government had closed a peace agreement with the guerrilla movement FARC (German: revolutionary forces of Colombia), which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">International was considered the signatories of the peace agreement as an important that the Colombian President José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits services.</seg>
<seg id="2188">However, in front of Columbus, there is still a long way to talk about a real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla fought for many years in illegal camps, exposed to war rhetorics, and around the clock their weapons made in their weapons to integrate them into life as civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">"" "" "" "the Colombian society again who had accustomed to life in perpetual fear, and in some cases, they have to record their rows and support them in creating a new life." ""</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Kolumba had joined together and to help the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And exactly the did they do: until now, thousands young people have written letters - love messages to former guerrilla struggle to welcome them again in the company.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The goal of the campaign are 6900 letters, one for every former guerrilla fighting - which will then be handed out personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The Valentine's Day as inspiration for the Campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for reconciliation was created on the World Summit of Peace Laureate, which took place in Bogotá in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to talk with Kailash Satyarthi, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">"" "" "" "this explained that we love the people whom we love, on the day of thousands of love letters, but those that need them much more necessary." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2197">"" "he plane, he told his love to share his love with people who needed the most urgent show." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2198">So, the plan was created to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC. "the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a war history to a common history of peace," they say.</seg>
<seg id="2199">So far, more than 2000 letters were collected in the framework of campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'I never would have thought that someone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over on March 19 in one of the UN camps in the Caldono Cauca region.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the city administration of Cali and Leonardo from the Foundation BogotArt traveled to the camp to deliver the letters personally.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC shown so on how they had done it earlier to accept the commands of their leader.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they did not receive commands, but letters from people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for all involved. "it's incredible how many different feelings one can walk in just a few hours - from anxiety to luck and everything that is between" "" "the political science student Manuela Jiménez Avila later." ""</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a member of the governors of the Valle del Cauca province described this memorable experience as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After having handed over the letters, a former fighters led me by the camp of guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">"" "when I saw in one of the" "" "CamBook" "" "(a way to live in which the guerrilla fighting live), I saw a guerrilla fighting who wrote something." ""</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to enter, because in addition to his bed the MGL-pomp was a fatal weapon in the village of DornRoman.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "I asked him," "" "hello, what do they say?" "" "he said," "" "I am a letter which someone has written to me." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>

<seg id="2214">I embraced him completely, and set me beside the pomegranates.</seg>

<seg id="2216">"" "" "" "the man told me more about his life." "" "he had never expected something from life as war." "" "I have never thought to preserve him and his six brothers in front of the hunger." "" "I have never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes." ""</seg>
<seg id="2217">"" "but now I know that there is a company without the open arms that wait for us." ""</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now I have learned, how I have to handle weapons with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">But now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity. "</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">Students and some leader of the FARC joined a discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="2222">They were all grown up as already war and the FARC already existed in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">Therefore, the leader of the FARC proved the history of the organisation, their ideals and gave insight into their views over the peace process: "many years have experienced, how we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party, we can help to design the society in this country.</seg>
<seg id="2224">"" "for a target of these orders it is worth to overcome all obstacles," "" "said one of them." ""</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">"" "" "" "these people have never been found that yet had never seen hearing, and had not learned that people who were often seen as monsters, and they even hate people who were shot through their lives and environment, was very painful for me." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2227">The truth, where the land lives, does my hurt to me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">"" "" "" "but comfort me that all men - even those who have killed and so much harm to give us something, and a smile and a hug can give us." ""</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have answered the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo González, the commander of the camp in Caldono Cauca, wrote for instance Darío de Jesús Monsalve, Archbishop of the city of Cali, the following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The column was made, that according to the disarmament peace would rule peace.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as it is inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always give people who are ready to hold the weapons and protest to their rights. and this is also completely justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">We are waiting for the FARC now in peace, on a policy without weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call all the defenders of peace - no matter what breed, religion or ideology, they are over all those who dream of a country in war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, afford our contribution and offer sacrifices, because we know of your own experience, that nothing is simple. all of us that defend life as the basis of the existence, many difficulties will be coming.</seg>

<seg id="2410">Arab Ahwazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region, which is based on the majority of Iran-living Arab Ahwazi community, was shaken by a profound economic crisis which makes it hard to fight their habit.</seg>
<seg id="2412">In front of a century, the Arab Ahwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran, until the Pahlavi Monarchy took power and took up major efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahwaz region, there are some of the biggest in Iran's largest oil and gas fields as well as some of the most influential and valuable areas for the Iranian farming.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to be slow, and the indigenous population receives only little of this wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often victims of untreated diseases, hunger and compensation.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime denied the Ahwazi-Arabs systematic workplaces in local oil, gas and petrochemical industry.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government has also built a variety of demmen, the water of the Arab regions in the Persian areas where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom are approaching.</seg>
<seg id="2418">This demme is only led to destroy the devastation in the region by dryness, and local farming as well as the fish and palm industry.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab Ahawzi-adolescents now increased to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian General Director for cooperation, work and social welfare, reported that 5% of Ahwazis, who have completed one work, completed elementary school, 55% have completed a university degree.</seg>

<seg id="2423">Kenimi said that particularly the unemployment remains worse than worse due to unemployment. reason for this, a combination of a high number of Ahwaz re-coming Ethnic Persians and an anti-Arab discrimination in the setting process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">Since functionaries and institutions are not preferred for Arab workers, the local Arab Ahwazi will have access to work opportunities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is a part of the systematic policies of the ruling regime which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and to forcing her living from her home Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to change their benefits and surnames to hide their citizenship to the Ahwazi and not tolerated, because the Arab names are not tolerated in the workplace, because speaking the Arab language, or the Tragen Arab clothes.</seg>

<seg id="2437">If I say that I'm not a feminist, react many women - in particular white women who describe themselves as intersectionaries feminists - with frustrust.</seg>
<seg id="2438">You wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even experienced well-thought scientific and social arguments before me, why I should be feminist and why we generally should be all feminist *.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, in spite of equal education, women still earn less money than men.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women still are still under stringent observation, if it goes back to make her body with her body.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social standards are still to ensure that women earlier or later in various fields of life to a smooth blanket, and that discrimination based on the sex still attracts across many different countries and beliefs.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All this is aware and known.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced of it and I am double and triple.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet, if I say on skin colour, on black Cis women, on black transidente women, on black women in the LGBTIQ community, as well as we mentioned, as well as outside of feminist movement, many white feminists and white intersectional feminists were to be silent.</seg>
<seg id="2448">However, they all agree that women - all women - together should come together, to raise their voices and 'Kumbaya, my lord, "to sing the equality (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they don't want to speak that there is also an institutional form of institutionalised form and assionably motivated violence, which we are exposed to black women on two times.</seg>

<seg id="2452">Or that women in black spans and women with migration background are exposed to a higher risk to suffer domestic violence and violence in the partnership as white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the other hand, I want to join all men, all men and all humans are not any movement in the same rights; on the other hand, I cannot consider as a black woman who refused to consider unjust to consider unjust to the gender as well as the skin colour of a person.</seg>

<seg id="2456">I feed myself to join me groupings, which also absorbed by cultural enrichment of our customs and customs, to drive their egocentric program.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will no longer try to settle white women the importance of the overcutting of skin colour and gender. because some of them will continue to keep the importance of black women for feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to turn them.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although the intersectional feminism was founded in order to give women of different heron, and descend from the white feminism, in its name still the word "Feminism" in its name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">"" "" "" "I'm going to join me full and whole of feminism, which was founded for my dark skin and my status as a woman who is very hard for a white feminist paradigm, that is so hard, that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon." ""</seg>

<seg id="2463">In a womanist environment, I can lift black women and women from other cultures, because in this paradigm exist.</seg>

<seg id="2495">In the ads, 40% of women, that they were physically harassed, 55% of women were suffering from psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2496">But these statistics show not the real extent of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, takes place with his understanding</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is only rare or not mentioned in the media. it is a growing area that addressed one of the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons before the place of medical research there are two reasons: for a lack of global health care, many medicines and vaccines, which cover the special medical requirements on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have significant effects in the poorest countries in Africa than elsewhere, and missing investment for research of these diseases are a large problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Secondly, research, which is carried out by African scientists in Africa, has its own research capacities in Africa. a larger role of science and technology can only be eligible for the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is Director of Central Center for research of infectious diseases in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew up in the 1990s in Lusaka, Zambia, just as the AIDS epidemic was the first engraved effects on national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Sambia for studying in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">When Postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania he researched himself on HIV-virus before he decided to go home to home the samic health system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about misunderstanding of the media.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(Disclaimer: Dr. Warrier speaks as a private people).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment, the focus is on the application of research results. I suppose the samic national program for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">I just starved a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">Gv: what are your opinion about the important scientific topics in your country and general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no basic research here. we only put solutions to that by what have been developed.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This must change, otherwise we will always stay receivers instead of the makers.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions that we get, are often usable in our environment, and sometimes it is impossible to use it here.</seg>
<seg id="2606">Gv: where does financing and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it adequate?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How easy or difficult, it is to find appropriate scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are different and funded differently.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who come back or go here, because funding and development chances are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Gv: how is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What obstacles are there in your routine research work that you didn't had before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: basic infrastructure does not correspond to standards in developed countries. it costs much money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory materials is expensive, and it takes months to import them from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">Gv: what about the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there are already interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would propose that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Gv: how large is your opinion according to the potential of scientific research in Africa, which should focus on themselves, and how can we assist the development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all age groups.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There are need of special scientific training, starting at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer science, big data, investigation of the space, health care (non-transferable and contagious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine are very beneficial.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Gv: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as scientists in Africa against Western countries, based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often are the limited speed, things to do, and the resulting access to scientific expertise, which represent the challenges.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The system that magazines are only accessible against payment (the so-called "Paywall"), also the amount of available information and speed of research.</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "Open Source" seed producers of global food production change</seg>
<seg id="2628">This post by Rachel Cernansky appeared initially on the website Ensia.com, a magazine which reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been bred already since the 1980s in the USA salad.</seg>
<seg id="2630">His company offers 114 varieties, such as Outredness, the first plant, cultivated by NASA astronauts in space and has been consumed.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For nearly 20 years, mortality has been given only by its own offence and the question as many salutches can get limits.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000s, he noticed that more salads were patented and that he could not continue to use it again.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents are not only for individual varieties but also for certain properties like resistance to diseases, a special rotary or green or green leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the last years, more such patents have been registered for more plants such as cereal or cartilions. due to this trends, plant breeding, environmental protection and experts have been providing food safety in the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia of old tradition, Morton is still salad, he needs to be longer, because his work has always been increased by more restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "it's what would be in a river a rock, to whom I have to blunt." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">"" "so we must do this now, but it is a fracture with the breeding tradition," "" "he says." "" "I think that this patents will go on salads." ""</seg>
<seg id="2638">"" "and if they stand before judgment, no one can be patented, because all features are patented," "" "he makes it so good as possible and trying to help those who want to help you." ""</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, however, it is very careful and endeavoured to use any material that is protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">He also joined a movement which is always bigger in the United States and everywhere in the world: open source Breeding ("open source" breeding).</seg>

<seg id="2643">It is not coincidence that this name does rather sound as it would come from the IT area and does not come from the area of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (Initiative for "Open Source" seed) can be inspired by the movement for free "open source" software, which provides alternatives to copyright protected by copyright.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was established in order to ensure that some plant species and gens are not protected as intellectual property and are suitable for planting plants.</seg>
<seg id="2646">In the context of the initiative, called Ossi, US breeder can also undertake that other one can use them farmed seed.</seg>
<seg id="2647">This means that, however, do not want to do business with her seed and do not sell it. "open source" breeder can be used to crucify your seed, and it will not expose to other varieties - two aspects which banned by many plant patrons.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Whispering prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">Professor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi's board member Jack Kloppenburg are control of the seed and the possibility to breeding new plants, both important for food safety and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">That plays an role in larger cohorts such as biodiversity, rights of farmers, control over the nutrition system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeder would try to use the latter, or not only little to use seeds with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg is emphasised that the "open source" movement are not working with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetable, grain, genetically modified or not from ecological farms, which is likely to buy locally, locally and sustainable producing vegetables, such as the species is being offered on farms, such as the vegetables is bred, threatening that the vegetables is threatened.</seg>
<seg id="2654">Dietary sovereign without seed sovereignty is not possible. "</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed initiative undertake care of that their seed continues to be freely available. in contrast to this, seed and plant features are to be patented.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi Supporters argued that the future of food supplies are at risk since the available genpool due to the more abundant intellectual property rights on plant material, which is therefore always limited to shrink.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, Executive Director of Ossi, engaged in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. it took out that about one-third of all the raw material features are protected as intellectual property, which is either not only available either.</seg>
<seg id="2659">For other plants, there are still no estimates, but experts like Luby promised that massaging plants like wheat in even larger style are patented as salad or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of vision</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants become so farmed that they have targeted features - from such, through which their taste or their color improves until such, because they flourished in certain environments such as jackets or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponent of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeder decreases due to more patents. genetic diversity is currently more necessary than ever before, as the changing conditions due to climate change is much worse.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail, Monsanto-speaking Carly Scaduto know that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsantos activities. with a total of four genbanks and co-operation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States set itself the company for the conservation of genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">"" "they contradicts that intellectual property is other breeders, since" "" "patents and the protection of plant varied innovations" "". "" "" "a patent is basically taken, once the patent has expired." ""</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often this instructions help others to come with another approach to the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Thus, such protection is not inhibits innovations, but encourages them to be provided by public more material and know-how. "</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton looks different from different: 20 years to wait until a patent is certainly not innovations.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you're looking so long to wait for plants that are adapted to plants that are already lost to the changed environmental conditions, one would have lost the struggle.</seg>
<seg id="2669">"" "" "" "the main argument for Morton has always been a general meeting and continue to stay:" "" "independent plant breeding have neither the time nor the money for such formalities, and monetaries are not attractive for us." ""</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want to make farmers to ease their work.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"" "this is what instant drives us, and it is impossible to use us if we are not able to use the best and latest genetic resources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2672">"" "" "" "all in all, Morton disturb themselves to patented, plant features:" "" "we are not creating the characteristics." ""</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants make them up and breeders, we finally have no idea how the plants do it.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeding in the U.S. state, Oregon and Ossi's Executive Board, there is still another important aspect of plant breeding: "who makes a sort of breeding, also his own values in them.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with large Höfen and monoculture believes, are needed for an extension of herbicide, the breeding in its varieties of this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">"" "my concept is exactly" "" "" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized enterprises (such that move on international markets, but less than such as Monsanto are) patents, do not create most smaller seed companies, even without patents - either reject it or do it for too expensive and therefore not remuneration, or both is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">Frank Morton is looking for a breeding garden salads in its breeding garden Salata.</seg>

<seg id="2681">Morton is also known that breeders caused by the Avoid of plant patrons: "it looks like that I would like to produce new, stronger than companies that will be patented.</seg>
<seg id="2682">I need a new material for my catalogue, since I know that my competitors are being used for a few years ago, "he says." with a patent is for 20 years ago, with which one makes it very nice. "worldwide resonance</seg>
<seg id="2683">Although the US seem to be leading to the "Open Source" breeding, but the concept spends quickly around the world.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ("Centre for Sustainable Agriculture") describes itself as a professional organization in the area of resources, is an "open source" plant tools. to preserve the seed of traditional commercial applications, the center of farmers works together and helps them to fulfill new varieties that fulfill certain requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports them to come to "Open Source" to come and sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">"" "the German Organization Agreements works on an" Open Source "" "" License, which ultimately is a formal and legally binding form of the Ossi obligation for breeders in the European Union. "" "</seg>
<seg id="2687">(regulations for breeding themselves differ from country to land, abiding the Ossi obligation not just one of one in Europe or other parts of the world.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">At the beginning of November 2016, the executive of the European Union, the European Commission declares that the conventionally bred plants should not be patented. thus, it speaks against the current practice of the European Patent Office, the patents on conventional plants are allowed.</seg>
<seg id="2689">However, a statement is not yet a law, but now it is to bring to the governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line.</seg>
<seg id="2690">In October 2016 the Dutch organization Hivos organized a conference on "Open Source" plant systems in Ethiopia, on the farmers, operators of seed banks and seed companies from all East Africa, to learn something about the "Open Source" seed movement and the global trend towards patmentation of seeds.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos' Program for "Open Source" seeds declares that the organization is currently being a global alliance for "Open Source" plant systems that will fall off the official start next year.</seg>
<seg id="2692">A merger of environmental and development groups (among them Hivos, the international non-profit development aid organisation USC Canada and the Action Group on erosion, Technology and Concentration) has compiled a database to seed and biodiversity, to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map.</seg>

<seg id="2722">This time it met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a column.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend of the 05.August, the Egyptian government announced the website of the Act-Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world.</seg>

"" "it was never so difficult to overcome this goal." "" "it was never so difficult to overcome this goal." "" "we hope to meet the sperity and do not abandon it. we hope to meet our task." ""</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered the first censored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt, after the authorities blocked the independent news page MADA Masr, arabic-speaking edition of the Huffington Post and Qatar of Al Jazeera because of alleged "support of terrorism."</seg>

<seg id="2728">In addition to ANHRI, Ahmed Gamal Ziada has no access to the blog of the columnist and human rights research by Ahmed Gamal Ziada.</seg>

<seg id="2733">His article are mainly focusing on politics and human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a facebook comment, Ziada is expressed by the government and reflected what this means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">The blogs, blogs is very old, however, has priority on the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi, and even if the blocking of blogs may not be significant for the world, it is now for me for two reasons:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It has succeeded to mediate the feeling of a siege; An arrest, an attempt to murder, pre-charge of the national Security Council, the blocking blogs and any other website, for which I worked.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You have proven that I did not wrote in vain. in other words, my words have influence, if also only a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I want to mention that this blog was a archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First, I used it to the post of articles to handle the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">But now, after having closed it, they are afraid of words, can I change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The courageous goes to the way up to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and expression (AFTE), Egyptian authorities closed some technical websites in the network of various Internet Service Provider (ISP), including orange, Vodafone and Etisalat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">AFTE also documented the options of suppliers, through the paper ensuite and private surrounds, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">AFTE reported in their research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday the 12th of June we will offer how the blocking of websites that VPNs began.</seg>
<seg id="2746">A such practice indicates the intention of the government to block content and filtering that you could have access to the Egyptian users.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"" "" "" "the situation will also be prevented that the censored decisions can be taken after closed doors, making the Egyptian population does not cause legal basis for judgment against this actions." ""</seg>

<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil argued the journalist in Cecília Oliveira, the violence as a "war." this is your opinion according to a justification of failed security policy through the media and could make it difficult to draw responsibility in the police.</seg>
