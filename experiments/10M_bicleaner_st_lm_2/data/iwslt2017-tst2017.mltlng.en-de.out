this is James R@@ isen .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as New York Times in New York Times .
long before someone had heard of Edward Snow@@ den , R@@ isen wrote a book , in which he spectacular released that the N@@ SA was illegal phones of Americans .
but it &apos;s another chapter , that should leave a permanent impression .
in this process , he describes a cat@@ ast@@ roph@@ ic US intelligence in which the CIA was literally delivered to Iran for an atomic bomb .
if it sounds crazy , read it .
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who did not see the chapter at all ?
the US government .
for nearly 10 years , the government against R@@ isen has been determined and asked him to call his alleged sources .
in this train , he became a symbol for the design of the government , W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower to condemn and journalists .
according to the first Constitutional Court , the Media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right , if media doesn &apos;t receive this information , and if they cannot protect the identity of the cour@@ ier they give it .
so , as the government of R@@ isen , he did something that many cour@@ ageous repor@@ ter did already before him : he refused and said that he would rather go into prison .
from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen lived so with the risk to go into prison .
but then , only days before the trial , happened something unusual .
suddenly , even though she would have been crucial for their case , the claims of the government were dropped to R@@ isen .
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring , repor@@ ters and sources can always hide less .
rather than to fail and ra@@ vel to the statements , this also could do its digital foot@@ steps for him .
and then the investig@@ ator have wor@@ ried about his understanding , his telephone numbers ,
as like its e @-@ mail data , financial and ban@@ kin@@ dly information , its loan information , and even travel references with the list of its flights .
in the midst of these information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling , a CIA @-@ W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower and Ris@@ ens source , to condemn .
unfortunately , that is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower in his appeal . but instead , the judi@@ ci@@ ary has condemned more than all US governments in front of him .
now you can imagine how that a problem can be , especially because the government is involved too much from their work as ge@@ home .
since September 11 , almost every article on national security was the result of that a W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower went to a journalist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we therefore put the press work on the game which should be protected by the first Constitutional Court , because the government has always more possibilities to do all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but just as the technology of the government allows the rights of repe@@ ats , the press can also use technologies to protect their sources better .
and indeed , they can contact that from the moment , in which she was able to contact , rather than in the night , in the testimony .
today there are communication software , which did not yet have written as R@@ isen his book , and it is much more secure than normal e @-@ mails or telephone calls .
such a technology is Secure@@ Drop , an open source transfer system for W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower , which was originally developed by Aaron S@@ wart@@ z , and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation , which I have been working properly .
instead of an e @-@ mail , go to a news website , as the Washington Post here .
there you can upload documents or send documents , such as in any ordinary contact form .
these will then be encrypted and stored on a server , to which only the respective news agency has access .
so , the government does not expos@@ e more information secretly , and many of the information that would like to request it would not be available .
Secure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments around the world always develop new sp@@ y technologies that all of us are endangered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s to ensure that not only supplier of technology such as Edward Snow@@ den have an opportunity to destroy abuse . it is the same that we protect the next W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower . &quot; &quot; &quot;
who wants to report about abuse during the supply of soldiers . or to the next environmental worker , the alarm to acc@@ ru@@ ed water from F@@ lin@@ t . or a Wall@@ street @-@ Insider who warned us before the next financial crisis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after all these technologies , these technologies have not only been made for those who want to cover crime , but to protect our constitu@@ ent rights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you .
&#91; on April 3 , 2016 , the largest data le@@ ck of the history was published . &#93; &#91; what does this mean the rich and mighty &#93; &#91; enormous money sum@@ s in tax ha@@ v@@ ases . &#93; &#91; what does this week have been hidden from news about a gap of 11 million of documents in Panama &apos;s law firm Mos@@ bag Fon@@ se@@ ca .
the publication of this documents have a small insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
we will receive an impression of what customers , banks and lawyers like Mos@@ bag Fon@@ se@@ ca and say , &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set it ? &quot;
in fact , we really see the e @-@ mails , the exchange of messages , how the entire system works as it works .
this has already led to the first very direct consequences .
Iceland Prime Minister has withdrawn .
there is also reports that an alliance of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad has also been notified to tax companies in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
it is claimed that a track of 2 billion US dollars on Russia President Vladimir Putin is leading to a close friend from children &apos;s days , a famous c@@ elli@@ sts .
now there is a lot of rich people and others give the nervous about the next release , and to the next exp@@ orting documents .
now sounds like the plot of a agencies or a John @-@ Gr@@ ish@@ am @-@ ROM .
it seems to be a cry from you , to me the ordinary people .
why should this be ?
but the truth is : if the rich and M@@ ighty is able to hide their fortune in tax ha@@ v@@ ases and not all their taxes , then this means less funds for important public services such as healthcare , education , roads .
and this affects us all .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revel@@ ations are phenom@@ en@@ al .
in all over the world , media and leading politicians , such as secret tax ero@@ oms of some few are used to hide and dis@@ gu@@ ards -- something that we have been discus@@ sing and un@@ cover for ten years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think many people will be very conf@@ using this whole world , and it &apos;s hard to understand how this tax ha@@ v@@ ases work . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I make it always like a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
so you have a company in another company , in another company that makes it almost impossible to understand , who is behind this prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it can really be very difficult for criminal persec@@ utions and tax authorities , as well as journalists or civil society really want to understand what is the matter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think it is interesting that there is less reports about this matter .
probably , because there were no more prominent Americans that came in these revel@@ ations to this sc@@ andal .
now it is not so that there are no fact that it does not hide their fortune in tax ha@@ v@@ ases .
but by the principle , after which these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ bag Fon@@ se@@ ca has less American customers .
we would have a data le@@ ck of the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would have much more cases and examples that have connections to the United States .
in fact , it is so that you need to use less information in some US states , less information to found a company than to get a Library card .
this type of In@@ transparent in the USA has allowed the employees of school districts permitted to complete school children .
it does not allow ru@@ ff@@ les , particularly vulner@@ able an@@ ji@@ b .
it is this type of behavior , which affects us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness , we &apos;ll need to figure out what this is in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a hidden investigations into the offices of 13 companies in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ators gave himself as an African Minister , who wanted to bring money to the United States to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
us sho@@ cked it really , that all until one advoc@@ ate our investig@@ ator suggestions , how he could transfer his money .
these were all pre@@ ferences . none of these lawyers took us as a client , and of course there was no one added to the money . however it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important to consider this not as individual cases .
it does not go to a separate lawyer , who has under@@ gone investigations in our c@@ apped investigations .
it is not about a single top policy , involved in a sc@@ andal .
it &apos;s how the system works , through corruption , taxes , poverty and inst@@ ability .
and to cope with this , we must change the rules .
we must change the rules to make this type of behavior .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this may all be very angry when we could do nothing but if nothing should have changed ; as if it is always the rich and poor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but as bor@@ row@@ ed optimization I can see that quite a lot has to change .
in the past few years we have seen gu@@ esses to greater transparency , which concerns the owner of companies .
the theme found political attention by the British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
since then the EU has been recorded in the central regist@@ ers at the national level , who is really behind companies in Europe , and who controls them .
one of the un@@ pleasant facts is that the USA will leave behind .
representatives of both parties have taken a bill in the two parliamentary chambers , but this makes not the progress that we would like to see .
we would really like to see how this Panama &apos;s revel@@ ations , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ases , as a means used to ensure more transparency in the US and globally .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness , this is a moment for changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need ordinary people who are mad when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind head@@ light companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need managers in the business , standing and say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ transparent is not good for the business &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians that recognize the problem and deplo@@ y itself , through the laws of this kind of in@@ transparent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
together we can finally end the In@@ transparent , which now makes this type of tax flight , corruption and money la@@ under@@ wear , finally complete .
this is the story , as I was almost ab@@ duc@@ ted and in the trunk of a red Maz@@ das would be .
a day after I finished my design studies , I made a rear train .
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stood and looked after my things .
he bought one of my art works .
he was in the city alone and made a road@@ trip through the whole country . afterwards he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while we paid the invoice , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where do you sleep today ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he did the whole thing worse , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I thought : &quot; Oh , man !
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer sleeping place now ?
but I &apos;ve just learned to know it ! he says he would go to the peace of peace , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans . I don &apos;t want to have been kidn@@ apped in the trunk of a Maz@@ das !
that &apos;s a small trunk !
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Do you like ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the night , I was in bed , I star@@ ed to the ceiling and thought , &quot; Oh man ! what have I broken ?
a wild boy sleeps in my living room .
what if it is crazy ? &quot;
I received such a fear that I went out of bed , at the door pointed to the door , and closed my sleep door .
but he was not mad .
we are still in touch .
the artwork , which he bought from me today depends on his class@@ room . he is now teacher .
that was my first experience as a host . it has completely changed my viewing angle .
perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood , were friends who were waiting for us to be discovered ?
people on my air mattress can accommodate me . it was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress .
let &apos;s make a leap over two years later ...
I am unemployed , almost ple@@ ite , my roomm@@ ates and the rent will be increased .
I learned that there were a design conference at that time . all hotels were booked up .
I think , creativity can do it , anxi@@ ety in fun too .
I wrote my best friend and new co @-@ residents Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I could make something like this . our apartment is equipped with a designer bed @-@ and @-@ breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk including breakfast and every morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we created a site and founded &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three happy guests were able to sleep for 20 dollars on air mattress on wooden floors .
they found it great , and we also found .
I &apos;m sure to decor@@ ate our cheese ham @-@ O@@ mel@@ odi@@ s completely different because we made them for our guests .
we were touring with them through the whole city . when we did our last guest , and the door went into the castle , Brian and I participated in .
had we just discovered that we could find new friends and paying our rent ?
the things were in rolls .
my former roommate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to figure out how to do it a business concept .
we presented ourselves to investors : &quot; we want to create a web site , on the people public pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their baths -- the kind of rooms , whose doors is passing .
over the Internet , they can invite wild people to sleep with them .
this will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited that the miss@@ ile was ign@@ ited .
but did not put it .
no one who is still in consol@@ ation , would invest in a business , which allows to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we have learned to all children , strangers are dangerous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have a problem , you explain to things that can be good . we could design .
at the Academy of Arts , we learned that design much more is than just look and h@@ ap@@ ti@@ k -- it &apos;s the overall survival .
we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create peace with confidence , between people who never met before .
can design work so something ?
is it possible to create with design confidence ?
I would like to give you a sample , which degrees we trust .
it &apos;s a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your com@@ for@@ cing one .
thum@@ bs up if you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now I would like to un@@ lock your mobile phone .
enter your un@@ lock mobile phone with your left seat .
this silent suit of pan@@ ic , which you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts will feel when you open the door first time .
for the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone , your home is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , you can see your bedroom , your kitchen , toilet .
how does it feel to keep the un@@ locked mobile phone of a stranger in the hands ?
most feel the responsibility .
so we feel most guests , if they can stay somewhere else .
only from this reason our company can exist .
only so , who now has Al Go@@ res cell now ?
could you announce that he would like to serve the president of the president ?
you can return the mobile phones now .
they now have experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I would like to tell you some discover@@ ies .
what if we had changed a small detail in this experiment ?
what if your neigh@@ bor would have been presented once with his name ; if he would have told , where he comes , how his dog or his children are called ?
imagine , you would have 150 ideas that say : &quot; he can hold fast very well @-@ locked mobile phones ! &quot;
how would you feel then if you would have to give your mobile phone ?
because a well @-@ engine@@ ered feedback system strengthens the confidence decisive .
at the beginning we have done some things wrong .
it was difficult to ad@@ dic@@ ate the people , negative compensation departments .
ultimately , we decided to wait until both hosts and guest their findings , before we set them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we examined with Stan@@ ford a study . we examined how likely it is that people trust in succession , depending on how they are at age and residence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; little sur@@ prisingly , we trust the people of most , who are most similar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the more differences we find , the less trust we trust .
this is a natural social Vo@@ re@@ ingen@@ ome .
it is exciting when you add the call of a person -- in our case by evidence .
if you have fewer than three findings , nothing changes .
but it has more than ten , changes all .
a good reputation of simil@@ ar@@ ities .
so the right design can help us to overcome some of our deeply ro@@ oted pre@@ ferences .
Moreover , we drove that confidence is dependent on this , how much one gives off .
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you tell a little bit like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hi ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t get no answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tells you too much as for example : &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- the request is also not accepted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is therefore an optimal degree of open@@ ness , for example &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tol@@ le art works in your apartment ! I &apos;m doing with my family holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how to create it with design , make this degree of open@@ ness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct quantity text . we also give tips to what topics should write something .
our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help to overcome our pre@@ judi@@ ces opposite strangers .
with which we had not reck@@ oned , the great amount of people who were more than ready to lay down these advantages .
here you see how many people take our offer .
you can recognize three things .
first : incredibly good luck .
secon@@ dly : the ti@@ reless work of our team .
third : a need that was not covered before .
the shop is very good for us .
of course there are times , if not everything is running smoothly .
there were guests who celebrated part@@ ys party or homes have been rav@@ aged .
hosts have guests in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked on customer service . all calls came directly on my phone .
I stood at the front front when confidence was broken .
there is nothing worse than this calls . it already wo@@ e when I think only .
the dis@@ appointment which one hears in the voice of the An@@ ru@@ fer , and will always be our biggest motivation to improve us .
fortunately , only a fra@@ ction of the 123 million overnight stays only had a problem .
for people confi@@ ded one to another .
when confidence is working , it can create miracles .
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . he suffered a heart attack there .
his hosts drove him to hospital .
he even stopped blood for the necessary surgery !
here is his assessment :
&quot; perfect house for trav@@ ellers who tend to heart attack because of sitting activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
Javier and Ale@@ j@@ andra is real gu@@ ardian that rescue a life , although they don &apos;t know a gar .
they drive a car to the hospital , when you die , and wait , while you get a b@@ yp@@ ass .
because they don &apos;t want to feel it , they bring books over .
they can even stay longer , without charge the extra @-@ night .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
this is not running any stay .
but these relationships behind the pure banknotes are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
for the first time I was proud of this term , I asked me :
how does the thought of participation together with money transactions ?
it goes here to a economic trade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it just now just call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not just the case . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Share Economy describes a trading , human relationships promises .
people lay a part of itself , and that changes all .
if you travel today , it is to compare fast food with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
but what would be , if traveling a rich buffet from local currency would be ?
what would be , if you visit to any place where you visited , a group there would be a thoroughly re@@ plen@@ ish and one at a circum@@ ference of a quarter , one of which one has never heard ;
or if you want to learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
nowadays apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what would be if we would like to be rented apartments from the ground ?
what would that look like ?
what would be if cities would take part in the common part ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I set up the cities which allow us and relationships , instead of sol@@ itude and fir@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this project was begun in Seoul , South Korean , and a lot of parking that belonged to the government .
now people were offered . students who were looking for a stay in search of a stay ,
they were medi@@ ated to humans whose children were drawn up . the incub@@ ators were started ,
in order to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy , over our platform alone 7@@ 85 000 people are participating in 191 countries with a stranger or even hosts .
so the idea seems to be so crazy , as it was brought to us .
we didn &apos;t invented the bike .
hospitality also gave it before@@ hand .
there were already similar websites before us .
so why did our works ?
apart from luck and tim@@ ing , we found that you can find the right design with the components of the trust .
design can help us to overcome deep @-@ root advantages .
I find it amazing ,
almost amazing .
I have to think about it , when a red Maz@@ da goes over to me .
we know of course , that design can not solve every problem .
but if it could help us if it had this great influence , I wonder what we can use for design shortly .
thank you .
what do you think when you see me ?
a bel@@ i@@ ever ? a expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or supp@@ ressed , under@@ go a brain under@@ wear , a terror pianist ?
or simply a delay on the airport at the airport .
that is indeed true .
I don &apos;t give you the fault to your negative impressions .
so let the media represent the media , as I look like .
a study revealed that 80 % of the reporting on Islam and Muslims are negative .
studies show : the Americans do not know any Muslims .
probably men do not speak with their U@@ ber drivers .
for all those who have never met a Muslim Brotherhood : it is great , you want to know .
I tell you that I am .
I am a mother , a coffee @-@ operated -- double es@@ pres@@ so , with wh@@ ipped cream extra .
I am hop@@ ed ,
a carr@@ y@@ holder of fan @-@ fan in ,
and I am a pract@@ ising , spiritual Muslim min .
but not like Lady G@@ aga , because , baby , I was not born .
I decided to decide .
when I was 17 , I met the decision to ou@@ ten me .
no , not as hom@@ os@@ exual man , like some of my friends , but as Muslim min . I decided to bear the Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head cover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my femin@@ ist friends were astonished : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do you hate yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was , at that time it was a femin@@ ist declaration of independence , namely that I felt as a 17 @-@ year @-@ old , I was able to custom@@ ize me a perfect and un@@ achiev@@ able beauty ideal .
I have not only believed to have the faith of my parents .
I have with the Kor@@ an .
I read it , thought to question , doub@@ t@@ ful and believed in the end .
my relationship to God was not love at first sight .
she was confidence and slow dev@@ otion , which are deep@@ ened with each reading of the Kor@@ an .
the beauty of rhyth@@ mi@@ k bring me sometimes to the weeping .
I know myself . I feel that God knows me .
did you ever feel the feeling that someone doesn &apos;t perc@@ eive you , and som@@ eh@@ ow love som@@ eh@@ ow ?
so it feels .
later I married and began like all the good Egyptians , my career as a engineering .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I later , after my marriage , a child , and lived for the reason to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then he was the terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I sat at the end of my kitchen , looked at the end , looked on the screen and saw the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Eil@@ ab@@ un . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was smoke , air@@ planes flo@@ ps into buildings , people spread out of buildings .
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical disorder ?
my shock turned out quickly into Emp@@ ty .
why should I do something ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I switched to the television channel and heard : &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; Muslim terror@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; Ji@@ had ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oh my God .
it is not only my country attacked , but in the N@@ u related me the deeds of others from a civil war into a susp@@ ects .
the same day we had to go through the Middle West of the USA to move into a new city and start with the post@@ graduate studies .
I remember -- as we were silent -- as we were silent -- so deep it went into my seat , and I feared the first time when Muslim min .
we moved to our apartment in our apartment , in a new city , where it felt like a completely different world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then I heard and read the war@@ nings of the national Islamic organizations that said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be careful of &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; be careful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lead to good illuminated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not deceived . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed in the whole week .
then it was Friday in that week -- the day when Muslims gathered to prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and again the war@@ nings , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Go not on this first Friday , the mosque could be a goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage .
the feelings have under@@ stand@@ ably sur@@ prisingly , and I heard of attacks on Muslims or people who had stayed for Muslims who remained in free and struck .
there were really bran@@ dan@@ es on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because people who had attacked this land had attacked our country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I got the rage of people to terror@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine ! I was mad .
it is not easy to explain itself .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
these are the accus@@ ations that are hard .
today we can actually hear people : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims .
when will we go ? &quot;
some people want to beat Muslims and mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church as a tumor in the body of the USA .
it is only the question : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or good ?
you know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tumor is removed as a whole and a good tumor , only under observation .
the alternatives are point@@ less because the question is wrong .
Muslims are , like all other Americans , not tum@@ our in the body of the USA , but an important organ .
thank you !
Muslims are inventor and teachers , nar@@ ro@@ fer and Olymp@@ ian clinics .
will lock the locking of mos@@ ques in America ?
there will perhaps be a few parking spaces , but not stop the terror .
the regular visit of a mosque leads to consider people with other faith toler@@ ant , and greater civil participation .
and as I told me a director of the police in the Washington area , DC recently told : people are actually not ra@@ zed in mos@@ ques .
they are radi@@ alised in their cellar or bed in front of a computer .
when the radio process is found that he begins online . when the person of their church is cut , even by their family , that the person believes that the terror@@ ists are the true Muslims , and everyone who ab@@ hor@@ red their behavior and their ide@@ ology , is a betra@@ yal or faith .
if we want to prevent radi@@ cal@@ ization , we must stop the people to go to the mosque .
some are still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group just like the IS its brut@@ ality with the cor@@ an .
as Muslim min , as a mother , I believe that we must do everything to stop a group as the IS .
but we would then add to their suburbs , when they know them as a representative of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x cl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ide@@ ology reasons on their &quot; Holy Book . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if you have a look at it , they do not casts out what they had in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Scripture &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is their breeding , which they can read these things in the Scrip@@ tures .
an outstanding idea told me recently an amazing story :
a girl came to him , because they come to the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if they have been in contact with radi@@ al religious leaders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the problem . everybody had spoken , she brought her to silence , and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to silence , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to silence in the world , only in trouble . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of nothing insp@@ ires and something that had given her rage , she was a main goal for instrum@@ ent@@ alisation by extrem@@ ists who promised a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this Im@@ am set the connection to God and its church again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
instead of accused her rage , he showed her construc@@ tive paths for a real change in the world .
what she met in the mosque , she kept it to join the IS .
that was an insight , as the Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia me and my family .
but how does it work on normal Americans ?
how does it affect everyone ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour use of anxi@@ ety every day to our democracy , to our freedom of freedom ?
a study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we fear that there will happen at least three things .
we rather accept an authorized governmental system , conformity and pre@@ judi@@ ces .
a study shows : if one considers test persons messages , in which negative over Muslims has been reported , they vote rather than military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not just an academic problem .
if you look , when the atmosphere against Muslims came up at the top -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the early days of Iraq and during two elec@@ toral periods .
so , Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia is not easy the natural response to Muslim terrorism , as I expected it .
it can actually be a tool for manip@@ ulating the public to de@@ fied the foundation of a free society , the sensible and well informed citizens .
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we perhaps feel it as the first , but the toxic air of fear gives us all .
in the assignment of collective debt , it does not just need to explain itself .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple that lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school .
De@@ ah was a sport@@ s@@ men .
he was involved in the dental fac@@ ulty , talented , promising ...
his sister would say to me that he was the sweet , generous person to whom she knew .
she visited him and he showed her cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um . she was amazing and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when is this a reversible young man ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne at her brother and his wife , she was murdered , like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who was murdered in the afternoon . he did it in her apartment as with a execution , after he had posted outside Muslims on his Facebook page .
he shot eight times on De@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism can not only be fatal , but also deadly .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
are we gone to the mosque , we stayed in at home ?
we bes@@ ought it and for us there was no light decision , because it was therefore what we want to ex@@ alt our children : one that would control us through fear , or one where we can exercise our religion .
we decided to meet the mosque .
with our son in the child &apos;s seat , we left silent , with high pressure to the mosque .
I took it out , and my shoes went out , went into the building hall , and what I saw , let me hold .
the hall was completely filled .
then , the Im@@ am made a announcement , and called our guests welcome , because half of the Jews were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hist@@ s , Ath@@ ei@@ sts , believers and Non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to stand for us .
in this moment I am collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had courage and compassion pan@@ ic and pre@@ judi@@ ces .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose to choose fear and fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism at the moment ?
will you go on number safe ?
or will you join them that are my : we are better than that .
thank you very much .
thank you nice !
Helen Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a Ner@@ ve .
but I wonder what do you say that you might say that you &apos;re talking a T@@ ED@@ Talk , a monument with dr@@ au@@ ght , thus an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t matter . I am completely normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual , as it is allowed .
if you look at Muslims in all over the world , and I did that with the largest ever carried out on Muslims in all over the world , people want normal things .
they want to make peace for the family , they want to work , and they want to live in peace .
so I &apos;m not an exception .
if people like an exception to rule , then the rule is usually broken , and they are not the exception to rule .
HW : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
as a special platform for Bast@@ ers , it &apos;s just before to become one billion business .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial thr@@ ones . made possible in research institutions around the world .
before the air package in our social consciousness , a autonomous fleet of flight machines at the Fra@@ c Centre in France has built a six meter high tower of 1 500 bricks . some years ago they started to fly with cords .
due to connecting air tools , high speed and acceleration can be mounted on the smallest space .
you can also build self @-@ loaded structures .
they have lear@@ nt to wear loads , to deal with tur@@ bul@@ ences and generally respond to natural laws .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the limits of possible in autonomous flight .
so that a system aut@@ on@@ om works , it needs to know collective bar@@ en@@ vy , where in the room the mobile objects are located .
in our lab at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a branch of our laboratories .
there are no external cameras .
each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , calculations on board what the machine should do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; external commands are available in the highest eye . for example , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called Heck@@ el starter ,
one aircraft , trying to beat two flies with a f@@ lap .
like other star@@ ring , it is efficient in advance , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all their variations .
in contrast to most of the star@@ ring gl@@ ers , it is a great advantages at start and landing , and is very versatile .
but there is always a swe@@ eping page .
a limitation of rear @-@ star@@ ters is that they react sensitive to tur@@ bul@@ ences like wind turbines .
we develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the air intake is capable of re@@ att@@ ained the optimal position and can be improved through practice .
okay .
during our research we often ask fundamental abstract questions which leads to the core of the thing v@@ ord@@ r@@ ingen .
such a question would be for example : what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known as a machines with a thousand mot@@ ion@@ less parts , who can choose to viol@@ ate you .
for decades ago , drivers could fly remote control units , which only had two moving parts : a propeller and a tail@@ gate .
un@@ long , we discovered that flies with just one works .
this is the Moon inner , the mechanically sim@@ pl@@ est remote control unit . it was invented in front of a short term .
it only has a movable part , a propeller ,
no clothes , hing@@ es and trans@@ verse ru@@ der , no further pitch or control surfaces , only one propeller .
although it is mechanically simple , inside the inner life , so it can fly as well as it can move in the room .
nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear star@@ ters . to bring it to fly , I have to throw it exactly right .
the probability to throw it exactly right when I see all , is small , therefore I show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening .
when the Mon@@ op@@ inner is an exercise in sol@@ itude , this machine is here , the Omni@@ cop@@ ter with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in over@@ flow .
what to do with all this over@@ flow ?
they see that he is only symmet@@ ri@@ cally .
therefore he is ambi@@ val@@ ent in his orientation .
thereby he receives the highest possible ability ,
in the room to move in all directions , no matter which direction it is rot@@ ated or even like it rot@@ ates .
of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers of eight prop@@ ellers .
some is available in models , the rest is lear@@ ns directly at the flies .
let us see that .
if flying machines have to be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine is composed of two separate two @-@ propeller aircraft .
this turns in clock@@ wise
and the other against clock@@ wise .
when you build them together , they are like a high @-@ performance Quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
however , if something wrong -- a engine or propeller falls off , the electronics , or a battery -- the machine can continue even if restricted .
we will now demonstrate it , going to be a half air@@ worthy .
the last demonstration studied synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a pallet on aesthetic expression .
we took commerci@@ ally available micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equ@@ ip them with loc@@ alis@@ ing technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where space is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore there is no limit .
hop@@ efully motiv@@ ating this demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine as dr@@ one wants to get a flying lamp screen on Broadway .
of course it is difficult to predic@@ table the influence of this technology .
for types like us , the salary is in the development and the Schaff@@ ner Act .
it serves as a reminder , how wonderful and ench@@ anting our universe is , and that it is creative to shape it on so spectacular way to form it .
the fact that this technology has such a massive and economic potential , is the bag fel@@ lows on the i .
thank you very much .
before 1.3 billion years ago , two black holes are always qu@@ icker and faster , you walked so the mass of three times in a tenth part of pure energy .
for this short moment , they brigh@@ tened brigh@@ ter than all the stars in all galax@@ ies of the whole universe .
it was a very big kne@@ eling .
but they don &apos;t put their energy in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was given into space @-@ time po@@ s , and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we arrange the events at first time .
just 1.3 billion years ago , the life was formed on earth .
ever since then the earth has brought much : cor@@ als , fish , plants , sau@@ rier , people and -- God stand up for us -- even the internet .
about 25 years ago , a group of particularly cour@@ ageous -- R@@ ai Weiss decided to build a huge laser detector , to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , which arise around by col@@ li@@ ous black holes .
most held them for crazy .
but enough people knew her as crazy gen@@ ies , so that the US National Science Foundation was financed their idea .
after decades of tel@@ ev@@ anger development , design , conception and extremely much har@@ der work built the detector L@@ IG@@ O : the Laser @-@ Inter@@ fer@@ ometer Ob@@ servatory .
in the following time the precision of L@@ IG@@ O could significantly increased significantly , which improved the recognition performance .
therefore it is called Advanced L@@ IG@@ O .
at the beginning of September 2015 L@@ IG@@ O was started to clari@@ fy some smaller , hard @-@ hard problems .
on September 14 , 2015 , only a few days after the start @-@ up of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of the two Colom@@ bian black holes through the earth .
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hug@@ hes : only two moments in my life were emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the good@@ bye to my father &apos;s father .
in the reason , the fruits of my life &apos;s work .
all this , what I worked for I was no longer Science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hug@@ hes , theoretical physi@@ cist on the MIT . he exam@@ ines from black holes and their serv@@ atories like L@@ IG@@ O . what are gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ?
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a ru@@ sion in the Ge@@ ar of space and time .
when passing the shaft , the space and its entire content will be stretched into one direction and into the other .
illustr@@ ative instru@@ c@@ tors lead in courses in courses for the Rel@@ ativity of theory often a really al@@ ber@@ ing dance .
&quot; stretching and dust , stretching and dust . &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves extremely weak , even ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous , are ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous .
on the 14th of September , for example , everyone was stretched to the waves of the waves and stopped . stretching of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 .
that means 20 N@@ ul@@ len after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1 . therefore , one declared the L@@ IG@@ O staff for crazy .
with a five kilometer long laser detector , which is already ab@@ sur@@ d , it would have to be measured at less than an thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of a nuclear power . this is Gr@@ ot@@ es@@ k .
at the end of his classic text about grav@@ itation
described K@@ ip Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder L@@ IG@@ Os , hunting according to waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties during the construction of such detectors are enormous .
but physi@@ cist are final and with the support of the public will overcome all obstacles . &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to L@@ IG@@ O . Scott claims that L@@ IG@@ O be more an ear than an eye .
I want to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavelength , which is much smaller than the things around us : facial lifts , the size of your phone .
that is quite practical . for this way you can produce a picture or a map of things by taking it out of several points coming light around you .
in killing is that different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters .
therefore it is very hard , actually impossible to produce a picture of things which means you very much :
about the face of your child .
instead , we listen to certain properties like tape and height , rhythm and volume to close the history behind it .
&quot; now just Alice . &quot;
&quot; and Bob comm@@ ends it . &quot;
&quot; stup@@ idly Bob . &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we can do not produce any simple images of objects in all .
but having regard to changes in am@@ plitude and frequency of waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least for L@@ IG@@ O , the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble range .
when we convert the shaft pattern to Sch@@ all , we can literally hear the universe .
the grav@@ itation to listen , can tell us about the coll@@ ision of two black holes , where my colleague Scott employs a very long time .
SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , zir@@ cons simple : w@@ up@@ p !
the two bodies are very fast , you hear the same cir@@ cl@@ ed with an additional sound change . this sounds like at : W@@ u @-@ force @-@ force @-@ force @-@ force @-@ force !
it is a kind of movement , shaped into the wav@@ e@@ form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date , which at least I never forget -- heard L@@ IG@@ O : &#91; Sur@@ ren@@ dition of the sound &#93; J@@ ECT , who knows how to hear it as sound of -- SH : ... two black holes each with 30 @-@ fold solar mass , which can be turned around as fast as the rods of your mixer .
AA : we over@@ lay what this means .
two black holes , the di@@ ch@@ est body in all , one with a mass of 29 tons , the other with a mass of 36 tons , round other times per second before they col@@ li@@ de .
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know it because we heard it .
it consists of the lead importance of L@@ IG@@ O .
L@@ IG@@ O is a fully new way to explore the universe , as it was never before .
on this way we can listen to all sounds and the invisible .
and much in all , we can &apos;t see -- practically or basically -- not .
a super@@ nova , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ole stars explo@@ de in Super@@ nov@@ ae .
they are very useful . of them we have learned much of them .
however , the thr@@ illing physical processes can be done in the core , which is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and silicon .
we will never see , because this op@@ ak are .
gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are penet@@ rating iron , as it would be transparent glass . the prim@@ rose : I would like to investigate the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it as the ur@@ anium is covered by his own neigh@@ bor .
with the help of gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , it should be possible to reflect back to the beginning .
and the most important : I &apos;m optim@@ istic that we have never seen in all things we have never seen , which we have never seen , and of whom we don &apos;t have any idea . things we can only discover by hearing we do .
in fact L@@ IG@@ O found the first start of things that we did not expect .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Evans , an important member of the L@@ IG@@ O project says to this topic : ME : the kind of stars that observed black holes , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient body from prehistoric times . the black holes are so special for our arch@@ e@@ ological work .
L@@ IG@@ O allows us a completely different viewing angle to the events in all , on the emergence of the stars and ultimately , as we went out of that chaos .
AA : the challenge is now so cour@@ ageous as just as possible .
thanks L@@ IG@@ O , we know how to build great detectors and cra@@ ck the noise and circulation of the cos@@ mos .
we need ideas for new Ob@@ serv@@ atories -- a completely new generation of Ob@@ serv@@ atories on Earth and All .
for what could be more beautiful than to listen to the urine ?
now the time is great dreams .
dreams for us with us .
thank you .
I tried out a experiment before some time .
one year long would I say to everything &quot; Yes ! &quot; I was afraid of whom I was afraid .
no matter whether it made me nervous that brought me to un@@ pleasant situations , I forced me to say &quot; Yes . &quot;
would I speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
wanted to be live on television ?
no , but yes !
wanted to start with the show ?
no , no , yes , yes , yes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a crazy thing happened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exactly what I was afraid , I feared my fear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my fear , talk to talk , my social fear -- Pu@@ ff , weg .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; Yes , &quot; has changed my life .
&quot; Yes , changing me .
but there was a specific Yes , that changed my life , to an un@@ exp@@ ec@@ tedly art . it started with a question of my small .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett , and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the youngest , calls out of in@@ explic@@ able reasons for &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as would it be a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; by , I don &apos;t need milk for my be@@ ak . &quot;
she asked them once , if I could play with her when I was at the leap . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
a new life of life in my family . from there I swe@@ ars me to play always with them , as soon as I go , or wh@@ i@@ ther I go , I say I always say Yes -- every single times .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I tired myself very much .
it has a magical effect on me , on my children , on our family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it also has an amazing side effects : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really got short , that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saved my career with my children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have a real dream job .
I &apos;m author . I think of things , bring it to life .
dream job .
no . no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I create TV . I create TV .
I &apos;m doing television , in large style .
in this TV season , I am responsible for this to carry 70 hours of program into the world .
four TV programs , 70 hours television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production .
each shipment has hundreds of jobs , which did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a TV station can lie between three and six million dollars .
let &apos;s say five .
a new episode every nine days of four shows , i.e. every nine days 20 million dollars on television , four TV stations : Grey &apos;s , 21 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours of television .
350 million dollars for one season .
my TV series will run on Thursday night in America .
all over the world are running my series in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are broad@@ casts , which I have created myself , and not only produced , so still alive , creative time to gather my fans of camp@@ fires and tell my stories .
four TV series , 70 hours television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , wareh@@ ouses around the world .
do you know who makes it even more ?
no one , that &apos;s why I am a titanium .
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to im@@ press it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I tell it , because I know what you think , if the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; author &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; falls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I tell you , that all of you who work so hard , if you say a company , a country , or a class@@ room , make sure that I say , I say , I understand that it does not work with a dream job .
it &apos;s all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all swe@@ at -- no tears .
I have a lot , hard and I love it .
if I &apos;m deeper into the work , there is no other feeling .
my work is always creates a country out of nothing .
it &apos;s when I turned into a screen when I got on a screen .
as a dream you can dream a high tone , fly a marathon .
one feels like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love it to work .
it is creative , mechanically , an@@ str@@ ati@@ fication and l@@ ump , funny , and anno@@ ying , clin@@ ically and reasonable , cruel , and reasonable . and the best thing is the sum@@ s .
there is so a change in me when the work runs fine .
a sum@@ s starts in my head , and it grows and grows , and the sum@@ s list@@ ens as a lively street , I could always go on you .
many people take , when I make them the sum@@ s that I persu@@ aded writing that the writing is fashi@@ oned me .
don &apos;t understand me wrong , that does it .
but the sum@@ s -- when I started working with television production , when I started working and working , to create and collabor@@ ate , I discovered this thing to create this sum@@ s , these energy . the sum@@ s !
the sum@@ s is more than the writing .
the sum@@ s is action and activity . the sum@@ s is a drug .
the sum@@ s is music . the sum@@ s is light and air .
the sum@@ s is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have a sum@@ s , you cannot do differently than in size .
the feeling , not different to try , regardless of size , no matter what price .
that is how the sum@@ s .
or maybe it also means a workflow .
perhaps it is gen@@ ius .
perhaps it is E@@ go .
perhaps it is the fear of the failure .
I do not know it .
I know only that I am not the failure of the failure , and I know that I love the sum@@ s .
I want to tell you only , I am a Titan , and I know that I don &apos;t want to ask it .
to make a clear : each more broad@@ casts , the more broad@@ casts , the more superior limits , the more things are at the same time , the more things at the same time , the more things do I write history , the more expectations there is more expectations .
the more I work to be successful , the more must work .
and what did I do about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the land , which I create , the marathon , which I run , the army , the screen , the high sound , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s .
I like this sum@@ s . I love the sum@@ s .
I need the sum@@ s . I am the sum@@ s .
am I only this sum@@ s ?
and then the sum@@ s stopped .
rev@@ amped , over@@ loading , ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated .
the sum@@ s stopped .
now my three daughters are acc@@ ust@@ omed to the truth , that her mother is a single work .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my m@@ om will not be there , but you can write to my N@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to go to Sh@@ onda country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the children of titanium .
they are Baby @-@ Titan@@ en .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the sum@@ s heard .
the sum of the engine was silent .
I loved my work anymore . the engine was out .
the sum@@ s did not return .
my sum@@ s was broken .
I made the same things as always : the same titanium work , 15 hours @-@ days , a closed weekends , no Reu@@ ter , not deleg@@ ating , a Titan Store does not exist , don &apos;t give up , with all your heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no sum@@ s .
in me was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a lecture Titan ,
everything was gray , I just had no fun anymore .
and that was my life .
all that I did .
I was the sum@@ s and the sum@@ s was I .
so what makes you doing , what do you do , the work that loves to love , suddenly infl@@ amed ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know , some may think , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Heu@@ l , the author of the author &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Titan Poker &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know what you do , man works , man loves to be a teacher , a ban@@ ker , a painter , Bill Gates loves to be a teacher if one knew the sum@@ s when the sum@@ s stops , who is it then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a titanium ?
when the song of my heart can I survive in silence ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then my &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; South @-@ states @-@ Kell@@ ner@@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am on the way to outside , too late and she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ om , don &apos;t you play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I will already say no , than two things are aware of :
&quot; &quot; &quot; first , I have to say Yes , and second , she called me not &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she calls no more &quot; prize . &quot;
when did it happen ?
I miss it when I &apos;m playing with Titan I and my sum@@ s , and here everything change my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and so they say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ om , don &apos;t you play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I say , &quot; Yes . &quot;
it is nothing special .
we play and play their sisters , we laugh too much and I l@@ ese very dramatic from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot;
nothing exceptional .
but it &apos;s outstanding because my pain and my pan@@ ic , in lon@@ el@@ iness , and in the absence of the Sum@@ mer@@ ing , I cannot do anything beyond .
I am foc@@ usses .
I am silent .
the land , which I create , the marathon , which I run , the army , the screen , the great sound - they do not exist anymore .
everything that exists , st@@ icky finger and hum@@ id kiss , delicate voices , wa@@ ist pins and the song , in which it goes to Los@@ let , or whatever the girls in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air on this place is so close that I hardly can bre@@ athe .
I can hardly believe that I breath@@ es .
play the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ solves .
a mental door goes on and an energi@@ esch@@ ub comes in .
and that &apos;s not immediately , but it happens .
I feel it .
the sum@@ s come back slowly .
no full volume , hardly there , it is quiet , hardly audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there .
but not the sum@@ s , but a sum@@ s .
and now I feel like a magical mystery .
but let &apos;s remain with the matter .
it is love . this is love .
no magic . no secret . just love .
it is something that we forgot .
the sum , the business circumstances which is titanium , which is only the replacement .
if I ask you who are you , who am I say if I am sure that my brain is sure that my brain is , then I forgot what the real sum@@ s is .
the sum@@ s is no strength and it is not working .
it depends on the joy .
the real sum@@ s depends on love .
the sum@@ s is the power , which comes from the way of life .
the real sum@@ s is self @-@ conscious and peace .
the real sum@@ s ig@@ no@@ red the pressure of history , allowing for the expect@@ ation and pressure .
the real sum@@ s is simple and original .
the real sum@@ s is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps I whis@@ per@@ ed to God the false words , for which God said to me , that I am a Titan ?
it is just love .
we all need a bit more love , much more love .
once my child wants to play with me , I will say Yes .
I am making a solid rule , so that I can deliver me as a workflow of any fault .
it &apos;s law , I have no other choice . I don &apos;t have other choice if I want to hear the sum@@ s .
I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
play it &apos;s not to play as well as working .
the truth does hurt ,
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work , because I love it .
I rather than at work as at home .
this conf@@ ession is pain@@ ful , because what a man works better than to be home ?
well , I , I .
hon@@ est , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; --
I have to have problems .
that I am at relaxed , is none of them .
we stayed in the garden around and back , and back .
we do little dance parties ,
we sing and play Ball .
we shred@@ ded Sil@@ k bub@@ bles .
so I feel mainly sti@@ ff , ab@@ sent and conf@@ used .
I always take up to my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
my children show me how to live , and the sum@@ s of the universe met me .
I play and games until I wonder : why have we ever heard with games ?
you can also say it ! Yes , if your child wants to play with you .
perhaps keep me for n@@ ai@@ v , for a day dre@@ amed .
there is right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
you can find less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play at most 15 minutes with me until they would like to do something else .
it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes a Marien@@ Beet@@ le or bis@@ cuit replaces me .
and speaks my te@@ ie @-@ daughter whole 15 minutes long with me , I am Mother of the year .
there are only 15 minutes , more needs it not .
everyone can bring to a piece of 15 minutes , even at a towing @-@ La@@ une day !
15 minutes at a piece !
no mobile , no clothes , no deposit .
the day is short : dinner , the children are bet@@ t@@ done .
but it takes 15 minutes !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my children are my pro@@ sper@@ ity , my world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there must not be the children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not to feel the sum to feel a place for his soul . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s not around playing with her children . it &apos;s about pleasure ,
around the &quot; Play &quot; in general .
enjoy the 15 minutes !
find out what you do well .
find out it out and keep it .
I &apos;m not perfect in this . I f@@ ails and I &apos;ll meet friends , books read and enjoy the day --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I want to play , when I was abandoned , when I was my first TV show , when I was playing a Titan in training , when I wanted me more and more sur@@ passed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
15 minutes on the piece , why don &apos;t it take full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the sum@@ s came back in my leisure time . the sum@@ s appears to return , if I do not work .
work not work without playing .
it takes time , but after a few months open a door , energy currents , and I find me in my office . I list@@ ened to me new ideas . I use it back to new ideas . I use it in full bre@@ ads and love my work .
I like this , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I am not the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s is not I ... no more .
bub@@ bles and st@@ icky finger , dinner with friends .
now this is my sum@@ mer@@ cies .
the sum@@ s of life .
the sum@@ s of love .
the sum of the work is part of me , but just one part . and I am so than@@ k@@ ful .
it is me that I am a Titan am . I never seen a titanium , who plays the journey to Jerusalem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said to less work and more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and yet , I have everything in the handle . my brain is still working yet . my camp fire still burn .
the more I play , the happ@@ ier are I and my children .
the more I play , the more feel I feel good mother .
the more I play , the more clear is my head .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the sum@@ s . the land which I create , the marathon , the voice , the screen , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the other , the right sum@@ s : the sum@@ s of life .
the more I feel the sum@@ s , the more makes this unusual , rest , naked and new life in me . less Titan -- more I !
the more I feel like this sum@@ s , the more knows I , who am I .
I &apos;m author . I think myself from , I bring you to life .
that belongs to the job , that means to live his dream .
that is the dream of this jobs ,
for a dream job should be a little dream .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for less work and more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Titan@@ en have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thanks beautiful .
I am Neuro@@ sur@@ geon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human trage@@ dies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I know how to change your life from one second to the other , after a severe stroke , or after a car accident .
for Neuro@@ sur@@ geon it is very fru@@ str@@ ating that the brain , unlike other organs , has a very small skill to the self @-@ cancer .
after a severe injury of the central nervous system , the patients often have a permanent , severe disability .
this is the reason why I was functional neuro@@ sur@@ geon .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgery ?
a physician , who tries to improve ner@@ ve functions through various surgical measures .
sure they have one of the most famous one of the most famous , the &quot; Tie@@ fen@@ cing stimulation . &quot; here , you im@@ planted a electro@@ de deep in the brain to influence the circuits of neur@@ ons so that the neuro@@ logical function improves .
it really is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Park@@ inson &apos;s fate , who suffered severe trembling and severe pain .
but neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean Ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geon is the restoration of the brain .
my opinion is approaching us this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close .
with a little help , the brain can help themselves .
the story began 15 years ago .
at that time I was leading medical lawyer and worked per day and night in the emergency .
often I used patients with skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma .
you need to imagine that near the skull @-@ brain trau@@ mat@@ a is increasing the brain and the skull of the skull .
to save life , one must decrease the skull pressure .
sometimes you need to remove a lot of s@@ wollen brain mass .
instead of s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analy@@ ze us with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a biolog@@ ist , the brain mass .
what should I do ?
we wanted to grow cells from this t@@ issues .
this is no easy task .
to leave cells of a tissue is comparable with all small children who are taken out of your families .
you must find the right diet , temperature , moisture and the environments to let them prosp@@ er .
exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many trials , Jean @-@ François managed .
he saw under his micro@@ scope .
that was a surprise for us .
why ?
it looked exactly as a stem cell culture . with large green cells , that are surrounded by small , mature cells .
perhaps you know from the bi@@ ologic classes that stem cells are un@@ mature cells that can trans@@ form into each cell type of organis@@ m .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . you are hidden in deep , small niche of brain .
it is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery .
we made a further fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very fast .
they never die , they are imm@@ ort@@ al .
but these cells were different .
they were slowly and after a few weeks , they even died .
so we saw a new , strange cell population that looked like the stem cells , but was different .
we needed long to understand how they came .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are hot Dou@@ b@@ lec@@ tic in @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make 4 % of our grand@@ mother cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the stage of the F@@ öt@@ us , they ensure the brain in the brain .
but why do they remain ?
we don &apos;t know this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that she will participate in the healing of brain , as we found it in higher concentrations in brain injury . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this is not so certain .
one thing is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells .
we stand in front of a potential cell source that allows brain healing .
we had to prove this .
so we decided to develop a experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ lingu@@ istic area and then the cells accur@@ ately used as it was Jean @-@ François . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then mark them in color to trace them in the brain .
in the last step , we im@@ planted them at the fac@@ ulty of the same individuals .
we call the aut@@ ologist Tran@@ splantation -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ ty .
one of our first questions was : what happens when we im@@ planted these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we im@@ planted the same cells in dig@@ ged brain tissue ?
we were able to work with the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller .
in the first scenario , we planted the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that they were completely lost after several weeks , they would go back home . the room is already occupied , they will not be used there , so van@@ ish them .
in the second scenario , we added a violation and im@@ planted the same cells and now remained the cells -- they were able to attack neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that were im@@ planted .
the evidence that they show , are these little points . these are the cells that we stain@@ ed in vitro .
we could not stop this .
help these cells also help to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual skill task .
you had to take animal pellets from a tray .
they made it very good .
when they had achieved a stable level of skill , we had the last engine in the motor bi@@ tex .
then the monkeys have been par@@ aly@@ zed , they could not move their hand .
just as it would happen in humans , they recovered spont@@ ane@@ ously up to a certain degree , just like a stroke .
the patients are par@@ aly@@ zed and then try to recover from plastic brain mechanisms . get up to a certain degree , just like the monkey .
when we were sure that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted its own cells .
on the left hand you can see the evil monkeys , which won &apos;t be spont@@ ane@@ ously .
it can bring about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from breach of injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
now , when we im@@ planted the cells : the same monkey , two months after the matur@@ ation plant@@ ation .
I can tell you that they were very exciting results .
ever since this time we found out much more about these cells .
we can use them fre@@ eze and later .
we can use it in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example at Park@@ inson &apos;s .
but our dream is still always to im@@ anti@@ fy them in humans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really hope that I can show you soon as the human brain gives us the means to heal himself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you very much .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Jo@@ cel@@ y@@ ne , this is wonderful , I &apos;m sure that just now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can do it . &quot;
I definitely go .
of course , the question is what the greatest obstacles are before you can start clinical studies on humans .
Jo@@ cel@@ y@@ ne blo@@ ch : the largest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results you need to fill two kilograms papers and forms to run this kind of studies .
BG : it is under@@ stand@@ able , the brain is very del@@ ic@@ ate etc .
J@@ B : Yes , but there is a long time , a lot of patience and a almost professional team .
BG : take a look at the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start of clinical studies . if you take further into the future , how many years it lasts until someone can come into the hospital , and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
first depends on the approval of clinical study .
will we allow the authority to start it soon ?
then you have to perform this study with a small group of patients .
it needs a long time to select the patient to perform treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this type of treatment .
this has to apply to a multi@@ center study .
you have to really prove that it is useful to be useful before you can offer this treatment .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : natural .
BG : Jo@@ cel@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting T@@ ED and that you have told us of it .
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we make a great mistake in the West , as of course .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t see democracy not as the frag@@ ile plant which is in reality , but as the inventory of our society . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we tend to consider them as un@@ changeable .
we believe that capitalism leads to democracy .
that is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and its great im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing have des@@ per@@ ate that it is quite possible to have a blo@@ oming capitalism and impressive growth , while the policy remains un@@ democratic .
indeed , democracy is in Europe , in Europe .
at the beginning of the year , when I presented Greece , the newly elected Greek government -- was declared in@@ corrup@@ ted that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- our elections -- not the savings programs could be realized in Greece .
in this moment I thought that there could be no better just@@ ification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my mist@@ re@@ ous friends that told me that the democracy would be abolished if it would change anything .
at this point I would like to introduce an economic model for a real democracy .
I would like to believe together with me again that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China , and even the Euro@@ group in a mistake , we could save the democracy , but that we need a tru@@ thful and def@@ ensive democracy .
because without democracy , our companies are common , our future dun@@ es and our great , new technologies are w@@ asted .
on the subject of waste I would like to point to an interesting contra@@ diction that is currently threat@@ ening our taver@@ n .
I call it the &quot; twin summit par@@ ad@@ ox . &quot;
a summit is known to you . they know and recognize him as the debt mountain which raises its long shadow over the USA , Europe , and the whole world .
we all recognize the debt mountain ,
but only few recognize his z@@ dy@@ mus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a mountain of un@@ used cash , which would be difficult to invest it , however , where it would be productive and income would be able to invest it and also all the things that humanity needs ur@@ gently needed , for example &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I call them two numbers .
in the past 3 months , 3.4 trillion US dollars were invested in the U.S. , in all the pro@@ sper@@ ity producing goods , such as industrial equipment , machines , office buildings , schools , streets , tracks , equipment and so on .
according to a lot of money , 3.4 trillion US dollar sounds much money , until you make it with the 5.1 trillion US dollars , which are at the same time in same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing , except for the stock markets and the real estate prices .
so , debts and un@@ productive capital form the twin summit , which does not affect the usual market mechanisms .
the results are stag@@ n@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 year old in the USA , Japan and Europe are unemployed , which might not invest a low demand in which they could not invest , that his son would kill him when he will grow .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rolled up the circumstances that lead him kill him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is my hair with capitalism --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his extremely pain@@ t@@ ful capital should be used to improve our lives , developing and developing the technologies , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; technologies that are crucial for the salvation of the earth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so is democracy the solution ?
I think already . but before we continue , what do we understand in democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the society form , to control the free and the arms as a majority to the government .
ath@@ en@@ ical democracy , of course , of course , of course --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
however , it would be a mistake to minim@@ ize the importance of ath@@ en@@ ical democracy due to these outputs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decisive thing in ath@@ en@@ ical democracy was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and not only the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive , which they have the right to political parties with same tuning @-@ weigh@@ ting issues in questions of state &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ath@@ en@@ ical democracy is not long kept --
like a candle that illumin@@ ates very light , it is also rapidly growing .
however , our current liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies have not their roots in the ancient Athens ,
but at the Magna Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American Constitution .
while the ath@@ en@@ ical democracy focused on the free citizens and strengthened the processing poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Magna Cart@@ a , which ultimately resulted in a statute for the ruling .
for the liberal democracy was first set up when a complete separation of politics and economy is possible , and the democratic process was imposed on politics , while the economy -- thus the world of concert -- a democracy @-@ free zone .
in our current demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time , in which this separation of politics and economy began , an in@@ her@@ edit@@ ary fight between the two men , taking the economy gradually dis@@ fe@@ as@@ ible politics .
do you wonder why politicians are not so how to do ?
it is not affected by a de@@ generation of their DNA .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is that one can be in the government today and nevertheless not in power because the power of politics into the economy is separated and separated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I mentioned my hair with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is like a herd of smo@@ kers , which are so sustainable the animals of which they nour@@ ished , dec@@ im@@ ated that they are hungry at the end .
similarly , it is similar to the economy that affects the politics as far as far by the self @-@ caused economic crisis itself . the power of the corpor@@ ations is increasing , increasing economic demand and the managing director of the corpor@@ ations are to be changed , the cash of their company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the more successful capitalism , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; demo@@ s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &#91; the people &#93; from democracy , the higher will become the twin summit , and the excess of human labour power and pro@@ sper@@ ity of humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this is true , we have to bring back the politics and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; demo@@ s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control , apart from the exclusion of the servants , the women and the foreigners . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a new idea .
the Marx@@ ist Lin@@ ke had this idea already 100 years ago and it was not very strange .
the doctrine of the Soviet Union should be that the working arms should only recover a position as in ancient Athens without creating new types of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is a solution : creating the working arms !
capitalism does it , replacing low @-@ wages , replaced by automation and robot .
the problem is , so long @-@ economy and politics can be higher , the automation makes the twin summit , and the social conflicts has deeper , as it &apos;s very soon as I believe -- in countries like China .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to rev@@ ise the economy and the fields of economy and politics again , in order to democr@@ ats the re@@ unified field of surveillance , otherwise we will show the movie &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a documentary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the question is not whether capitalism has brought the technical achievements , which he has to survive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the most interesting question is whether capitalism , through a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is similar to that the society in the research of the universe , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ en@@ ians &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ag@@ ora , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in long talks to the meaning of life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think we must be optim@@ istic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what do it so , how could it look like this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like D@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the practical implementation I would like to give you a few examples .
in the area of the company : imagine a capital market before you earn money , while you work and in which your capital you have to help you from a company to the next , and the company -- no matter what you &apos;re working -- is the property of them that currently work in the company .
then all income from capital and proceeds from Er@@ mit@@ es and the concept of wage work is completely over@@ hau@@ led .
no distinction between those who belong to the company , but they are not working there , but employees work where the company does not belong to which the company does not include any large g@@ aps between investment and sp@@ elt , and ultimately does not include the twin summit .
in the area of global political economy , please contact us that our national currencies would have a free fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , which is issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; group of 20 largest emerging markets &#93; , in the interest of whole humanity is issued .
&quot; &quot; &quot; imagine that the world trade will be tra@@ ded in this currency -- &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call them &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kos@@ mos &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in units of &quot; Kos@@ mos &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in units of &quot; Kos@@ mos &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and every government is equivalent to the trade surplus of the country , in a joint fund . &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine that the fund has invested in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world , in which investment funds are ra@@ r .
this is no new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes had suggested in the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference in 1944 .
the problem was that one did not implement the technical resources at that time .
today we have , in particular , in particular , in particular , in front of a recovered policy and economy .
the world , which I describe you , is at the same time liber@@ ates , in which they privileg@@ ed persons , and mar@@ ist@@ ically , because they buried the separation of capital and work in the tr@@ ash@@ less of history , and key@@ n@@ esi@@ onal , global key@@ n@@ esi@@ ology .
but above all others , it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy .
become we awak@@ ening in such a world
&quot; &quot; &quot; or become a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia sin@@ king ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
the answer depends on it , how we decide together polit@@ ically .
it is in our hands , and we do it better .
thank you .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Y@@ an@@ is ...
you decide to yourself in your biography itself as a liber@@ ate Marx@@ ists .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Y@@ an@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if any of what I have just said exactly , then Marx is relevant .
the reason for re@@ unification of politics and economy ... do we do not know the technological development of a massive decline in overall economic demand that Larry sum@@ mers as &quot; long @-@ term stag@@ nation . &quot;
through the transfer of this crisis of a part of the earth to the next , as we experience it , it will not only dest@@ abil@@ ize our democracy , but also the countries whose interest in liber@@ ally democracy is low .
if this analysis is true , Marx is quite relevant ,
as Hay@@ ek , that &apos;s why I am a liberal Marx@@ ist , and how Key@@ nes , and why am I also perfectly wir@@ r .
BG : actually , and now we are well .
Y@@ V : if one is not effective , you do not think enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosoph@@ ical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein , which said . BG : in your talk , you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner of the speakers , you have very clear what you think from the sight of the West to China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a large measures of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liber@@ als demo@@ cra@@ cies we have the calls of a democracy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I said in my speech , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We have limited the democracy to politics , while the area where the most part plays , -- the area of economy -- a fully democracy @-@ free zone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a sense if I may have this pro@@ voc@@ ative , China resem@@ bles China today to the 19th century England .
for -- Please remember -- We tend to combine liber@@ alism with democracy -- that &apos;s a mistake , histor@@ ically .
liber@@ alism , liber@@ als , as John Stuart Mill --
he was especially sk@@ ep@@ tical , which affects the democratic development .
what you can now observe in China , resem@@ bles very the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China now to announce that which the West has done to the west in the 19th century , sm@@ ells mighty to hypo@@ cris@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : I &apos;m sure that many people are curious to your experiences as Minister of Finance of Greece beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I informed that this is coming .
BG : Yes ...
how do you look back for six months later on the first half year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , out of personal perspective , and very dis@@ appointing because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone ,
not only Greece , but the Eurozone ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; namely , den@@ oun@@ ced us from the di@@ spar@@ ity , and the den@@ ying that a massive amount line through the euro zone began , and continue to develop massi@@ vely the development of the whole European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek alleg@@ ations -- the way , the first proposal was to den@@ oun@@ ced this den@@ ying --
it is right to do . unfortunately , the powers in the Eurozone , within the European group , continues to den@@ ying the den@@ ial .
but you know what comes .
this is the experience from the Soviet Union --
if one tries to receive an economic system that is not su@@ perf@@ ected , through political will and authority , one can assume any time , but when the change occurs , it happens ab@@ rupt@@ ly and destroyed .
BG : what change you see ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future if we do not change its construction .
BG : have you made any fault in your time as the Minister of Finance ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back !
if there is an Minister for Finance , or any of the minister , who claims after 6 months in office , especially in such an attack , claims that he had no error , then this is a dangerous person .
of course I made mist@@ akes .
the largest error was to sign the request for the extension of the debt program at the end of February .
I believed that there was an hon@@ est interest on pages of the wal@@ kers , to find a common solution .
but this was not .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they only wanted to bring our government to fall , only because they wanted to deal with the indications that they ran through the euro zone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they would not have collap@@ sed that they have been cat@@ ast@@ roph@@ ic program for 5 years in Greece .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is worse than the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Depression &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no one of the Tro@@ ika of the money that has raised us this policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ sal@@ er error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all that , and despite the aggressive t@@ ons of convers@@ ations , you seem to be quite a @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
my review of the European Union and the euro zone opposite to someone who lives and loves Europe .
my biggest fear is that the euro zone does not survive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for when it is not survi@@ ves , all charges will be beaten and destroy the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will not have been cat@@ ast@@ roph@@ ic consequences for Europe , but for the entire world economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy of the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when we agree on the way of a post @-@ modern 1930 , it will appear to me , it will be therefore also able to be able to act as the European Union as also the non @-@ Europeans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : we hope you are very wrong in this point .
Y@@ an@@ is , thank you for you were at T@@ ED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
by Roy Price , most of them have never heard yet , although it is responsible for 22 @-@ 40 minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entert@@ aining minutes , but not for many of you .
this goes back to the decision to hit the Roy three years ago .
Roy Price is senior employee at Amazon Studios ,
the TV production company from Amazon .
he is 47 years old , slim , has a yel@@ low@@ ish and describes Twitter as &quot; movies , TV , technique , Tac@@ os . &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for the shows and content that will produce Amazon .
of course , this is a very hard fighting sector .
there are already so many TV @-@ series that Roy may not select anything .
he must find shows that very well , very good .
in other words , he must find shows that are located right on this curve .
this curve is the evaluation process of over 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the evaluation is from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this review will receive .
if your show is rated 9 times higher , this winner is a winner .
then one has a successful show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these are shows how &quot; Break@@ ing Bad &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; The Wire &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; The Wire &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- all the shows that ad@@ dic@@ tive , where , after you have a season , your brain asks : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where are more of this episodes ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of show .
on the left side , here at this end , shows shows how &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- that should say you enough to say that at that end of the curve .
Roy Price does not work on the left side of the turn , because I think you need special intelligence to offer &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
he makes more thoughts about the middle break@@ age , the average television -- the shows that neither good nor bad , they are simply inspir@@ ing .
so , he must make sure that it is really on the right side .
the pressure is available , and of course it is the first time that Amazon is so something that Roy wants to risk nothing .
he wants to create successes .
he needs a guaranteed success , so he keeps a competition .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and cho@@ oses eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and presents them online , where they can view every free .
and when Amazon gives out free things , you feel right , right ?
millions of people look forward to this episodes .
however , they don &apos;t know that they will be observed during the shows of this shows .
they are observed by Roy and his team , all of them .
they record when you start the show when you &apos;re p@@ au@@ ded , which parts you jumps and check again .
you will collect millions of data to decide with these data , which show you should produce them .
in fact , they collect the data , and this makes the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com over four republi@@ can U.S. trans@@ itions . &quot;
they made this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
Yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many of them can remember that show because it was not so good .
it is only an average show -- in the tru@@ sts of the word -- since the average of this curve 7.4 amounts and alpha House lan@@ det at 7.5 -- thus something about the average , but not just what to be Roy and his team .
about the same time with another company , another manager has a top show through data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy is always on the search to find these a super show and he uses data for it , but he makes it something different .
instead of a contest , he and his team got the existing data on the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , thus the reviews they give the shows , which shows the shows , which shows them etc .
then they ut@@ ili@@ ze these data to find these little details about the spectators : what shows they like , which actors , which actors .
when they had all the parts together they went a car , and decided to do not a Sit@@ com over four transmitters , but a drama series about an Senator .
do you know this show ?
Yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has hit a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; house of Cards &quot; obt@@ ains a 9,1 review on this curve . so exactly there where they wanted .
of course , is the question : what happened here ?
one has two very competent , data reversible firms .
they combine these many data and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
why this is this ?
because logic had som@@ eh@@ ow bes@@ ought that that should work with everything .
if you collect millions of data , for a decision which you meet , then you should make a good choice .
it has 200 years to statistics as a back @-@ up .
we optimi@@ zes it through very powerful computer .
the least what you can expect is good television , or ?
if data analysis does not work so , this is somewhat sc@@ aff@@ ingly , because we live in a time , in which we have more and more to statistics , in order to meet serious decisions , far beyond television .
someone knows someone here the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
nobody . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room come in contact with this software . come in contact , you are in prison .
if someone asks here in the United States and to ask the release , it is likely to determine whether the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dis@@ mis@@ sal is carried out or not .
just like on Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but rather than decide whether a show is good or bad , it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad .
medium television , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but still more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that these data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results . this is not aware that a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems do not know how to use data .
there are also the most diversi@@ fied companies lie wrong .
Yes , even Google has sometimes error .
in 2009 , Google announced that it can anticip@@ ate data analysis of flu , the worst species , predic@@ ts -- by data analysis of the Google research .
it worked mira@@ cul@@ tured and was a great news station . the success was successful in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature &quot; magazine .
it worked perfectly , year by year , until it suddenly did not work anymore ,
and no one could say why .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it just didn &apos;t work , this was once again a sens@@ ation , including the re@@ vocation of the publication &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nature &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the dat@@ ast@@ er@@ est companies such as Amazon and Google are sometimes mis@@ understood .
despite all these mist@@ akes , data have been involved in the decisions of life a -- on the workplace , at the end of the law , in medicine .
so , we should make sure that data are helpful .
I know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ assisted genet@@ ics -- an area where some very smart people can use un@@ imag@@ in@@ able many data to make serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy
or the development of a drug . over the years , I recognized a few patterns on the difference between successful decisions using data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be dissem@@ inated .
ever , you have to solve a complex problem , do they mainly do two things :
as First break@@ down the problem in its parts , so that you can analyse the individual parts ; as a rate , you set the individual parts again to hold a conclusion .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : apart and set up again .
and now the most important : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to dis@@ assem@@ ble and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to assem@@ ble the parts and then come to an end .
there is another tool and we all have it : our brain .
if there &apos;s something , when the brain is good , it is parts and pieces again , even if the information is un@@ complete , in order to hold a good conclusion -- especially when the brain is an expert .
therefore , I believe that Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they have data and understanding , where they also belong to the process .
you can use the data to understand their audience , for why they would not have been able to assem@@ ble all these parts , but the decision how to make all these parts , and there is no show how &quot; House of Cards &quot; does not stand in the data .
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , which meant that they entered a personal risk with this decision .
Amazon , on the other hand , on the wrong way .
they used to control all their decisions , first as they chose TV ideas as they voted &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe decision because they could always say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that the data say us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data are helpful to better cho@@ ices , but I believe that things are wrong when data start to control our decisions .
regardless of how powerful they are , data are only one tool , and in order to forget that this device is quite useful .
many of you will ...
before it was data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions by a Ja@@ ime or No @-@ Question you must only shake the ball to get a reply . &quot; highly likely &quot; -- exactly here in this moment .
I &apos;m going to be re @-@ true later with a technology demo .
I have met some decisions in my life , whereby I should listen to the ball in the afternoon .
but , as you are of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace them through something much le@@ verage , such data analysis to make better cho@@ ices .
but this does not change the foundations .
for example , the ball will be cl@@ ashed and kl@@ ing . finally , it &apos;s to meet decisions if we want to achieve something exceptional at the end of the right curve .
and I perc@@ eive this as a very encour@@ aging message that despite the great amount of data is still paying attention to make decisions , an expert in which you do , and risks to enter the risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for at the end there is not the data , but the risks that you have at the right end of the curve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks beautiful .
