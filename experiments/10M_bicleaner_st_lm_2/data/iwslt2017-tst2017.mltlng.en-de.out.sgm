<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as New York Times in New York Times.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before someone had heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book, in which he spectacular released that the NSA was illegal phones of Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it's another chapter, that should leave a permanent impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this process, he describes a catastrophic US intelligence in which the CIA was literally delivered to Iran for an atomic bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If it sounds crazy, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who did not see the chapter at all?</seg>
<seg id="9">The US government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For nearly 10 years, the government against Risen has been determined and asked him to call his alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this train, he became a symbol for the design of the government, Whistleblower to condemn and journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the first Constitutional Court, the Media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right, if media doesn't receive this information, and if they cannot protect the identity of the courier they give it.</seg>
<seg id="14">So, as the government of Risen, he did something that many courageous reporter did already before him: he refused and said that he would rather go into prison.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015, Risen lived so with the risk to go into prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, only days before the trial, happened something unusual.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly, even though she would have been crucial for their case, the claims of the government were dropped to Risen.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring, reporters and sources can always hide less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rather than to fail and ravel to the statements, this also could do its digital footsteps for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And then the investigator have worried about his understanding, his telephone numbers,</seg>
<seg id="21">As like its e-mail data, financial and bankindly information, its loan information, and even travel references with the list of its flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of these information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA-Whistleblower and Risens source, to condemn.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately, that is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect Whistleblower in his appeal. but instead, the judiciary has condemned more than all US governments in front of him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how that a problem can be, especially because the government is involved too much from their work as gehome.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, almost every article on national security was the result of that a Whistleblower went to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "" "" "we therefore put the press work on the game which should be protected by the first Constitutional Court, because the government has always more possibilities to do all." ""</seg>
<seg id="28">But just as the technology of the government allows the rights of repeats, the press can also use technologies to protect their sources better.</seg>
<seg id="29">And indeed, they can contact that from the moment, in which she was able to contact, rather than in the night, in the testimony.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today there are communication software, which did not yet have written as Risen his book, and it is much more secure than normal e-mails or telephone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such a technology is SecureDrop, an open source transfer system for Whistleblower, which was originally developed by Aaron Swartz, and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation, which I have been working properly.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of an e-mail, go to a news website, as the Washington Post here.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send documents, such as in any ordinary contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These will then be encrypted and stored on a server, to which only the respective news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">So, the government does not expose more information secretly, and many of the information that would like to request it would not be available.</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments around the world always develop new spy technologies that all of us are endangered.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "it's to ensure that not only supplier of technology such as Edward Snowden have an opportunity to destroy abuse. it is the same that we protect the next Whistleblower." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">Who wants to report about abuse during the supply of soldiers. or to the next environmental worker, the alarm to accrued water from Flint. or a Wallstreet-Insider who warned us before the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "after all these technologies, these technologies have not only been made for those who want to cover crime, but to protect our constituent rights." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on April 3, 2016, the largest data leck of the history was published.] [what does this mean the rich and mighty] [enormous money sums in tax havases.] [what does this week have been hidden from news about a gap of 11 million of documents in Panama's law firm Mosbag Fonseca.</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of this documents have a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">We will receive an impression of what customers, banks and lawyers like Mosbag Fonseca and say, "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set it?"</seg>
<seg id="45">In fact, we really see the e-mails, the exchange of messages, how the entire system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to the first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland Prime Minister has withdrawn.</seg>
<seg id="48">There is also reports that an alliance of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has also been notified to tax companies in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is claimed that a track of 2 billion US dollars on Russia President Vladimir Putin is leading to a close friend from children's days, a famous cellists.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there is a lot of rich people and others give the nervous about the next release, and to the next exporting documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now sounds like the plot of a agencies or a John-Grisham-ROM.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems to be a cry from you, to me the ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should this be?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: if the rich and Mighty is able to hide their fortune in tax havases and not all their taxes, then this means less funds for important public services such as healthcare, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And this affects us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">In all over the world, media and leading politicians, such as secret tax erooms of some few are used to hide and disguards -- something that we have been discussing and uncover for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">"" "" "" "I think many people will be very confusing this whole world, and it's hard to understand how this tax havases work." ""</seg>
<seg id="59">I make it always like a Matrjoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">So you have a company in another company, in another company that makes it almost impossible to understand, who is behind this prayer.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "it can really be very difficult for criminal persecutions and tax authorities, as well as journalists or civil society really want to understand what is the matter." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">I think it is interesting that there is less reports about this matter.</seg>
<seg id="63">Probably, because there were no more prominent Americans that came in these revelations to this scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it is not so that there are no fact that it does not hide their fortune in tax havases.</seg>
<seg id="65">But by the principle, after which these tax havens work, Mosbag Fonseca has less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">We would have a data leck of the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would have much more cases and examples that have connections to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, it is so that you need to use less information in some US states, less information to found a company than to get a Library card.</seg>
<seg id="68">This type of Intransparent in the USA has allowed the employees of school districts permitted to complete school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It does not allow ruffles, particularly vulnerable anjib.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this type of behavior, which affects us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness, we'll need to figure out what this is in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a hidden investigations into the offices of 13 companies in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigators gave himself as an African Minister, who wanted to bring money to the United States to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">Us shocked it really, that all until one advocate our investigator suggestions, how he could transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">These were all preferences. none of these lawyers took us as a client, and of course there was no one added to the money. however it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this not as individual cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">It does not go to a separate lawyer, who has undergone investigations in our capped investigations.</seg>
<seg id="79">It is not about a single top policy, involved in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">It's how the system works, through corruption, taxes, poverty and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">And to cope with this, we must change the rules.</seg>
<seg id="82">We must change the rules to make this type of behavior.</seg>
<seg id="83">"" "" "" "this may all be very angry when we could do nothing but if nothing should have changed; as if it is always the rich and poor." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="84">But as borrowed optimization I can see that quite a lot has to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">In the past few years we have seen guesses to greater transparency, which concerns the owner of companies.</seg>
<seg id="86">The theme found political attention by the British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then the EU has been recorded in the central registers at the national level, who is really behind companies in Europe, and who controls them.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the USA will leave behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties have taken a bill in the two parliamentary chambers, but this makes not the progress that we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how this Panama's revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havases, as a means used to ensure more transparency in the US and globally.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness, this is a moment for changes.</seg>
<seg id="92">"" "" "" "we need ordinary people who are mad when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind headlight companies." ""</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "we need managers in the business, standing and say," "" "Intransparent is not good for the business" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "we need leading politicians that recognize the problem and deploy itself, through the laws of this kind of intransparent." ""</seg>
<seg id="95">Together we can finally end the Intransparent, which now makes this type of tax flight, corruption and money launderwear, finally complete.</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story, as I was almost abducted and in the trunk of a red Mazdas would be.</seg>
<seg id="97">A day after I finished my design studies, I made a rear train.</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stood and looked after my things.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my art works.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was in the city alone and made a roadtrip through the whole country. afterwards he would go to the peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "while we paid the invoice, I made the mistake to ask him:" "" "where do you sleep today?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">"" "he did the whole thing worse," "" "I don't know it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought: "Oh, man!</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I've just learned to know it! he says he would go to the peace of peace, but I don't know if he really plans. I don't want to have been kidnapped in the trunk of a Mazdas!</seg>
<seg id="110">That's a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "then I heard me," "" "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "a voice in my head said," "" "Do you like?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">In the night, I was in bed, I stared to the ceiling and thought, "Oh man! what have I broken?</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild boy sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if it is crazy? "</seg>
<seg id="116">I received such a fear that I went out of bed, at the door pointed to the door, and closed my sleep door.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not mad.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in touch.</seg>
<seg id="119">The artwork, which he bought from me today depends on his classroom. he is now teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">That was my first experience as a host. it has completely changed my viewing angle.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood, were friends who were waiting for us to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">People on my air mattress can accommodate me. it was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let's make a leap over two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I am unemployed, almost pleite, my roommates and the rent will be increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that there were a design conference at that time. all hotels were booked up.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think, creativity can do it, anxiety in fun too.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote my best friend and new co-residents Brian Chesky: "Brian, I could make something like this. our apartment is equipped with a designer bed-and-breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk including breakfast and every morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "we created a site and founded" "" "air mattress and breakfast" "" "[AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb]." ""</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were able to sleep for 20 dollars on air mattress on wooden floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it great, and we also found.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure to decorate our cheese ham-Omelodis completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We were touring with them through the whole city. when we did our last guest, and the door went into the castle, Brian and I participated in.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we could find new friends and paying our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">The things were in rolls.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to figure out how to do it a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">We presented ourselves to investors: "we want to create a web site, on the people public pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their baths -- the kind of rooms, whose doors is passing.</seg>
<seg id="139">Over the Internet, they can invite wild people to sleep with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">This will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited that the missile was ignited.</seg>
<seg id="142">But did not put it.</seg>
<seg id="143">No one who is still in consolation, would invest in a business, which allows to sleep in apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">"" "" "" "because we have learned to all children, strangers are dangerous." ""</seg>
<seg id="146">If you have a problem, you explain to things that can be good. we could design.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Academy of Arts, we learned that design much more is than just look and haptik -- it's the overall survival.</seg>
<seg id="148">We had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create peace with confidence, between people who never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design work so something?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create with design confidence?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a sample, which degrees we trust.</seg>
<seg id="152">It's a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comforcing one.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up if you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Enter your unlock mobile phone with your left seat.</seg>
<seg id="157">This silent suit of panic, which you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts will feel when you open the door first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">For the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone, your home is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your SMS, you can see your bedroom, your kitchen, toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to keep the unlocked mobile phone of a stranger in the hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">So we feel most guests, if they can stay somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only from this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Only so, who now has Al Gores cell now?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you announce that he would like to serve the president of the president?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can return the mobile phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">They now have experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I would like to tell you some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a small detail in this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor would have been presented once with his name; if he would have told, where he comes, how his dog or his children are called?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine, you would have 150 ideas that say: "he can hold fast very well-locked mobile phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel then if you would have to give your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well-engineered feedback system strengthens the confidence decisive.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we have done some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was difficult to addicate the people, negative compensation departments.</seg>
<seg id="175">Ultimately, we decided to wait until both hosts and guest their findings, before we set them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We examined with Stanford a study. we examined how likely it is that people trust in succession, depending on how they are at age and residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">"" "" "" "little surprisingly, we trust the people of most, who are most similar." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less trust we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social Voreingenome.</seg>
<seg id="181">It is exciting when you add the call of a person -- in our case by evidence.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have fewer than three findings, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But it has more than ten, changes all.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation of similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">So the right design can help us to overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">Moreover, we drove that confidence is dependent on this, how much one gives off.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "if you tell a little bit like" "" "Hi!" "" "you don't get no answer." ""</seg>
<seg id="189">Tells you too much as for example: "I have problems with my mother" -- -- the request is also not accepted.</seg>
<seg id="190">"" "there is therefore an optimal degree of openness, for example" "" "Tolle art works in your apartment! I'm doing with my family holiday." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="191">How to create it with design, make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct quantity text. we also give tips to what topics should write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudices opposite strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">With which we had not reckoned, the great amount of people who were more than ready to lay down these advantages.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people take our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can recognize three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: incredibly good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Secondly: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third: a need that was not covered before.</seg>
<seg id="200">The shop is very good for us.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there are times, if not everything is running smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who celebrated partys party or homes have been ravaged.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked on customer service. all calls came directly on my phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the front front when confidence was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than this calls. it already woe when I think only.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment which one hears in the voice of the Anrufer, and will always be our biggest motivation to improve us.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately, only a fraction of the 123 million overnight stays only had a problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">For people confided one to another.</seg>
<seg id="210">When confidence is working, it can create miracles.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holidays in Uruguay. he suffered a heart attack there.</seg>
<seg id="212">His hosts drove him to hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even stopped blood for the necessary surgery!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect house for travellers who tend to heart attack because of sitting activities.</seg>

<seg id="218">They drive a car to the hospital, when you die, and wait, while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want to feel it, they bring books over.</seg>
<seg id="220">They can even stay longer, without charge the extra-night.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">This is not running any stay.</seg>

<seg id="250">I find it amazing,</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost amazing.</seg>

<seg id="323">They speak of my church as a tumor in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">It is only the question: are we malignant or good?</seg>
<seg id="325">You know: a malignant tumor is removed as a whole and a good tumor, only under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">Muslims are, like all other Americans, not tumour in the body of the USA, but an important organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventor and teachers, narrofer and Olympian clinics.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will lock the locking of mosques in America?</seg>
<seg id="331">There will perhaps be a few parking spaces, but not stop the terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">The regular visit of a mosque leads to consider people with other faith tolerant, and greater civil participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as I told me a director of the police in the Washington area, DC recently told: people are actually not razed in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radialised in their cellar or bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">When the radio process is found that he begins online. when the person of their church is cut, even by their family, that the person believes that the terrorists are the true Muslims, and everyone who abhorred their behavior and their ideology, is a betrayal or faith.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent radicalization, we must stop the people to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some are still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group just like the IS its brutality with the coran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As Muslim min, as a mother, I believe that we must do everything to stop a group as the IS.</seg>

<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>

<seg id="351">"" "" "" "this Imam set the connection to God and its church again." ""</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of accused her rage, he showed her constructive paths for a real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she met in the mosque, she kept it to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">That was an insight, as the Islamophobia me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it work on normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour use of anxiety every day to our democracy, to our freedom of freedom?</seg>
<seg id="358">A study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show: if we fear that there will happen at least three things.</seg>
<seg id="359">We rather accept an authorized governmental system, conformity and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="360">A study shows: if one considers test persons messages, in which negative over Muslims has been reported, they vote rather than military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you look, when the atmosphere against Muslims came up at the top -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the early days of Iraq and during two electoral periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So, Islamophobia is not easy the natural response to Muslim terrorism, as I expected it.</seg>
<seg id="365">It can actually be a tool for manipulating the public to defied the foundation of a free society, the sensible and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We perhaps feel it as the first, but the toxic air of fear gives us all.</seg>

<seg id="381">We besought it and for us there was no light decision, because it was therefore what we want to exalt our children: one that would control us through fear, or one where we can exercise our religion.</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided to meet the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in the child's seat, we left silent, with high pressure to the mosque.</seg>

<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then, the Imam made a announcement, and called our guests welcome, because half of the Jews were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, Atheists, believers and Non-believers who came not to attack us, but to stand for us.</seg>

<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial thrones. made possible in research institutions around the world.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before the air package in our social consciousness, a autonomous fleet of flight machines at the Frac Centre in France has built a six meter high tower of 1 500 bricks. some years ago they started to fly with cords.</seg>
<seg id="410">Due to connecting air tools, high speed and acceleration can be mounted on the smallest space.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build self-loaded structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learnt to wear loads, to deal with turbulences and generally respond to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to exceed the limits of possible in autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">So that a system autonom works, it needs to know collective barenvy, where in the room the mobile objects are located.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our lab at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">We use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, a branch of our laboratories.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room, calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "external commands are available in the highest eye. for example," "" "and" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called Heckel starter,</seg>
<seg id="422">One aircraft, trying to beat two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other starring, it is efficient in advance, much more efficient than helicopters in all their variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">In contrast to most of the starring glers, it is a great advantages at start and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">But there is always a sweeping page.</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of rear-starters is that they react sensitive to turbulences like wind turbines.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the air intake is capable of reattained the optimal position and can be improved through practice.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research we often ask fundamental abstract questions which leads to the core of the thing vordringen.</seg>
<seg id="431">Such a question would be for example: what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known as a machines with a thousand motionless parts, who can choose to violate you.</seg>
<seg id="434">For decades ago, drivers could fly remote control units, which only had two moving parts: a propeller and a tailgate.</seg>
<seg id="435">Unlong, we discovered that flies with just one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the Moon inner, the mechanically simplest remote control unit. it was invented in front of a short term.</seg>
<seg id="437">It only has a movable part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No clothes, hinges and transverse ruder, no further pitch or control surfaces, only one propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanically simple, inside the inner life, so it can fly as well as it can move in the room.</seg>
<seg id="440">Nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear starters. to bring it to fly, I have to throw it exactly right.</seg>
<seg id="441">The probability to throw it exactly right when I see all, is small, therefore I show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening.</seg>
<seg id="442">When the Monopinner is an exercise in solitude, this machine is here, the Omnicopter with its eight propellers, an exercise in overflow.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this overflow?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that he is only symmetrically.</seg>
<seg id="445">Therefore he is ambivalent in his orientation.</seg>
<seg id="446">Thereby he receives the highest possible ability,</seg>
<seg id="447">In the room to move in all directions, no matter which direction it is rotated or even like it rotates.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of interactive rivers of eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">Some is available in models, the rest is learns directly at the flies.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let us see that.</seg>
<seg id="451">If flying machines have to be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine is composed of two separate two-propeller aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="453">This turns in clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When you build them together, they are like a high-performance Quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">However, if something wrong -- a engine or propeller falls off, the electronics, or a battery -- the machine can continue even if restricted.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will now demonstrate it, going to be a half airworthy.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration studied synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a pallet on aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took commercially available micro-Quadcopter -- each single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with localising technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where space is and is self-controlled. therefore there is no limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully motivating this demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe machine as drone wants to get a flying lamp screen on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course it is difficult to predictable the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us, the salary is in the development and the Schaffner Act.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a reminder, how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it is creative to shape it on so spectacular way to form it.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such a massive and economic potential, is the bag fellows on the i.</seg>

<seg id="469">Before 1.3 billion years ago, two black holes are always quicker and faster, you walked so the mass of three times in a tenth part of pure energy.</seg>
<seg id="470">For this short moment, they brightened brighter than all the stars in all galaxies of the whole universe.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big kneeling.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they don't put their energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was given into space-time pos, and the universe exploded in gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">We arrange the events at first time.</seg>
<seg id="476">Just 1.3 billion years ago, the life was formed on earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Ever since then the earth has brought much: corals, fish, plants, saurier, people and -- God stand up for us -- even the internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago, a group of particularly courageous -- Rai Weiss decided to build a huge laser detector, to search for gravitational waves, which arise around by collious black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most held them for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people knew her as crazy genies, so that the US National Science Foundation was financed their idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of televanger development, design, conception and extremely much harder work built the detector LIGO: the Laser-Interferometer Observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the following time the precision of LIGO could significantly increased significantly, which improved the recognition performance.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore it is called Advanced LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="484">At the beginning of September 2015 LIGO was started to clarify some smaller, hard-hard problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On September 14, 2015, only a few days after the start-up of the detector, the gravitational waves of the two Colombian black holes through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the goodbye to my father's father.</seg>
<seg id="491">In the reason, the fruits of my life's work.</seg>
<seg id="492">All this, what I worked for I was no longer Science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist on the MIT. he examines from black holes and their servatories like LIGO. what are gravitational waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a rusion in the Gear of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">When passing the shaft, the space and its entire content will be stretched into one direction and into the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">Illustrative instructors lead in courses in courses for the Relativity of theory often a really albering dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and dust, stretching and dust."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational waves extremely weak, even ridiculous, are ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On the 14th of September, for example, everyone was stretched to the waves of the waves and stopped. stretching of an average man was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">That means 20 Nullen after the comma, followed by a 1. therefore, one declared the LIGO staff for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five kilometer long laser detector, which is already absurd, it would have to be measured at less than an thousandth of the radius of a nuclear power. this is Grotesk.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text about gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">Described Kip Thorne, a co-founder LIGOs, hunting according to waves as follows: "the technical difficulties during the construction of such detectors are enormous.</seg>
<seg id="503">But physicist are final and with the support of the public will overcome all obstacles. "</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to LIGO. Scott claims that LIGO be more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than the things around us: facial lifts, the size of your phone.</seg>
<seg id="508">That is quite practical. for this way you can produce a picture or a map of things by taking it out of several points coming light around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">In killing is that different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">Therefore it is very hard, actually impossible to produce a picture of things which means you very much:</seg>
<seg id="512">About the face of your child.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead, we listen to certain properties like tape and height, rhythm and volume to close the history behind it.</seg>
<seg id="514">"now just Alice."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob commends it."</seg>
<seg id="516">"stupidly Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We can do not produce any simple images of objects in all.</seg>
<seg id="519">But having regard to changes in amplitude and frequency of waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for LIGO, the measured frequencies are in the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">When we convert the shaft pattern to Schall, we can literally hear the universe.</seg>
<seg id="522">The gravitation to listen, can tell us about the collision of two black holes, where my colleague Scott employs a very long time.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, non-rotating holes, zircons simple: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">The two bodies are very fast, you hear the same circled with an additional sound change. this sounds like at: Wu-force-force-force-force-force!</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of movement, shaped into the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date, which at least I never forget -- heard LIGO: [Surrendition of the sound] JECT, who knows how to hear it as sound of -- SH:... two black holes each with 30-fold solar mass, which can be turned around as fast as the rods of your mixer.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: we overlay what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the dichest body in all, one with a mass of 29 tons, the other with a mass of 36 tons, round other times per second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know it because we heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">It consists of the lead importance of LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="533">LIGO is a fully new way to explore the universe, as it was never before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way we can listen to all sounds and the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">And much in all, we can't see -- practically or basically -- not.</seg>
<seg id="536">A supernova, for example. I would like to know why masserole stars explode in Supernovae.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. of them we have learned much of them.</seg>
<seg id="538">However, the thrilling physical processes can be done in the core, which is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see, because this opak are.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitational waves are penetrating iron, as it would be transparent glass. the primrose: I would like to investigate the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it as the uranium is covered by his own neighbor.</seg>
<seg id="541">With the help of gravitational waves, it should be possible to reflect back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And the most important: I'm optimistic that we have never seen in all things we have never seen, which we have never seen, and of whom we don't have any idea. things we can only discover by hearing we do.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact LIGO found the first start of things that we did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the LIGO project says to this topic: ME: the kind of stars that observed black holes, are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient body from prehistoric times. the black holes are so special for our archeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">LIGO allows us a completely different viewing angle to the events in all, on the emergence of the stars and ultimately, as we went out of that chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge is now so courageous as just as possible.</seg>

<seg id="698">No full volume, hardly there, it is quiet, hardly audible, but it's there.</seg>
<seg id="699">But not the sums, but a sums.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like a magical mystery.</seg>

<seg id="704">It is something that we forgot.</seg>

<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real sums depends on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The sums is the power, which comes from the way of life.</seg>

<seg id="712">The real sums ignored the pressure of history, allowing for the expectation and pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real sums is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real sums is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps I whispered to God the false words, for which God said to me, that I am a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a bit more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">Once my child wants to play with me, I will say Yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I am making a solid rule, so that I can deliver me as a workflow of any fault.</seg>
<seg id="719">It's law, I have no other choice. I don't have other choice if I want to hear the sums.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it.</seg>

<seg id="797">"" "" "" "as most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human tragedies." ""</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how to change your life from one second to the other, after a severe stroke, or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For Neurosurgeon it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other organs, has a very small skill to the self-cancer.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a severe injury of the central nervous system, the patients often have a permanent, severe disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is the reason why I was functional neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgery?</seg>
<seg id="803">A physician, who tries to improve nerve functions through various surgical measures.</seg>
<seg id="804">Sure they have one of the most famous one of the most famous, the "Tiefencing stimulation." here, you implanted a electrode deep in the brain to influence the circuits of neurons so that the neurological function improves.</seg>
<seg id="805">It really is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's fate, who suffered severe trembling and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">But neuromodulation does not mean Neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeon is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">My opinion is approaching us this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">With a little help, the brain can help themselves.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At that time I was leading medical lawyer and worked per day and night in the emergency.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I used patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">You need to imagine that near the skull-brain traumata is increasing the brain and the skull of the skull.</seg>
<seg id="815">To save life, one must decrease the skull pressure.</seg>
<seg id="816">Sometimes you need to remove a lot of swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of swollen brain mass, we decided to analyze us with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist, the brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="818">What should I do?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells from this tissues.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is no easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">To leave cells of a tissue is comparable with all small children who are taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You must find the right diet, temperature, moisture and the environments to let them prosper.</seg>
<seg id="823">Exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many trials, Jean-François managed.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked exactly as a stem cell culture. with large green cells, that are surrounded by small, mature cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you know from the biologic classes that stem cells are unmature cells that can transform into each cell type of organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. you are hidden in deep, small niche of brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made a further fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very fast.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells were different.</seg>
<seg id="835">They were slowly and after a few weeks, they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">So we saw a new, strange cell population that looked like the stem cells, but was different.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand how they came.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are hot Doublectic in-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make 4% of our grandmother cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the stage of the Fötus, they ensure the brain in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they remain?</seg>
<seg id="845">We don't know this.</seg>
<seg id="846">"" "" "" "we believe that she will participate in the healing of brain, as we found it in higher concentrations in brain injury." ""</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so certain.</seg>
<seg id="848">One thing is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We stand in front of a potential cell source that allows brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove this.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop a experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">"" "" "" "we wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non-linguistic area and then the cells accurately used as it was Jean-François." ""</seg>
<seg id="853">And then mark them in color to trace them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step, we implanted them at the faculty of the same individuals.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologist Transplantation -- Autotranty.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens when we implanted these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we implanted the same cells in digged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">We were able to work with the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario, we planted the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that they were completely lost after several weeks, they would go back home. the room is already occupied, they will not be used there, so vanish them.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario, we added a violation and implanted the same cells and now remained the cells -- they were able to attack neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that were implanted.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence that they show, are these little points. these are the cells that we stained in vitro.</seg>
<seg id="863">We could not stop this.</seg>
<seg id="864">Help these cells also help to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual skill task.</seg>
<seg id="866">You had to take animal pellets from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made it very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they had achieved a stable level of skill, we had the last engine in the motor bitex.</seg>
<seg id="869">Then the monkeys have been paralyzed, they could not move their hand.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen in humans, they recovered spontaneously up to a certain degree, just like a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">The patients are paralyzed and then try to recover from plastic brain mechanisms. get up to a certain degree, just like the monkey.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were sure that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted its own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left hand you can see the evil monkeys, which won't be spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can bring about 40% to 50% of its original performance from breach of injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Now, when we implanted the cells: the same monkey, two months after the maturation plantation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that they were very exciting results.</seg>
<seg id="878">Ever since this time we found out much more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can use them freeze and later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use it in other neuropathological models, for example at Parkinson's.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still always to imantify them in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">"" "" "" "I really hope that I can show you soon as the human brain gives us the means to heal himself." ""</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="884">Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, this is wonderful, I'm sure that just now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think: "I know someone who can do it."</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely go.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question is what the greatest obstacles are before you can start clinical studies on humans.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne bloch: the largest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results you need to fill two kilograms papers and forms to run this kind of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: it is understandable, the brain is very delicate etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: Yes, but there is a long time, a lot of patience and a almost professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: take a look at the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start of clinical studies. if you take further into the future, how many years it lasts until someone can come into the hospital, and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First depends on the approval of clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will we allow the authority to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to perform this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It needs a long time to select the patient to perform treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this type of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">This has to apply to a multicenter study.</seg>
<seg id="897">You have to really prove that it is useful to be useful before you can offer this treatment.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: natural.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you have told us of it.</seg>

<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We make a great mistake in the West, as of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">"" "" "" "we don't see democracy not as the fragile plant which is in reality, but as the inventory of our society." ""</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them as unchangeable.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">That is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and its great imitators in Beijing have desperate that it is quite possible to have a blooming capitalism and impressive growth, while the policy remains undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">Indeed, democracy is in Europe, in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year, when I presented Greece, the newly elected Greek government -- was declared incorrupted that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- our elections -- not the savings programs could be realized in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">In this moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my mistreous friends that told me that the democracy would be abolished if it would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to introduce an economic model for a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I would like to believe together with me again that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China, and even the Eurogroup in a mistake, we could save the democracy, but that we need a truthful and defensive democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">Because without democracy, our companies are common, our future dunes and our great, new technologies are wasted.</seg>
<seg id="914">On the subject of waste I would like to point to an interesting contradiction that is currently threatening our tavern.</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the "twin summit paradox."</seg>
<seg id="916">A summit is known to you. they know and recognize him as the debt mountain which raises its long shadow over the USA, Europe, and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the debt mountain,</seg>
<seg id="918">But only few recognize his zdymus.</seg>
<seg id="919">"" "" "" "a mountain of unused cash, which would be difficult to invest it, however, where it would be productive and income would be able to invest it and also all the things that humanity needs urgently needed, for example" "" "green" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">In the past 3 months, 3.4 trillion US dollars were invested in the U.S., in all the prosperity producing goods, such as industrial equipment, machines, office buildings, schools, streets, tracks, equipment and so on.</seg>
<seg id="922">According to a lot of money, 3.4 trillion US dollar sounds much money, until you make it with the 5.1 trillion US dollars, which are at the same time in same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing, except for the stock markets and the real estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">So, debts and unproductive capital form the twin summit, which does not affect the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The results are stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54 year old in the USA, Japan and Europe are unemployed, which might not invest a low demand in which they could not invest, that his son would kill him when he will grow.</seg>
<seg id="925">"" "" "" "rolled up the circumstances that lead him kill him." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="926">That is my hair with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"" "" "" "his extremely paintful capital should be used to improve our lives, developing and developing the technologies," "" "green" "" "technologies that are crucial for the salvation of the earth." ""</seg>
<seg id="928">So is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">I think already. but before we continue, what do we understand in democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the society form, to control the free and the arms as a majority to the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">Athenical democracy, of course, of course, of course --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">However, it would be a mistake to minimize the importance of athenical democracy due to these outputs.</seg>
<seg id="934">"" "" "" "the decisive thing in athenical democracy was" "" "and not only the right to freedom of expression, but more important and decisive, which they have the right to political parties with same tuning-weighting issues in questions of state" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="935">Athenical democracy is not long kept --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle that illuminates very light, it is also rapidly growing.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, our current liberal democracies have not their roots in the ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But at the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American Constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the athenical democracy focused on the free citizens and strengthened the processing poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Magna Carta, which ultimately resulted in a statute for the ruling.</seg>
<seg id="940">For the liberal democracy was first set up when a complete separation of politics and economy is possible, and the democratic process was imposed on politics, while the economy -- thus the world of concert -- a democracy-free zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">In our current democracies, since the time, in which this separation of politics and economy began, an inhereditary fight between the two men, taking the economy gradually disfeasible politics.</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you wonder why politicians are not so how to do?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not affected by a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">"" "" "" "it is that one can be in the government today and nevertheless not in power because the power of politics into the economy is separated and separated." ""</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hair with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is like a herd of smokers, which are so sustainable the animals of which they nourished, decimated that they are hungry at the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">Similarly, it is similar to the economy that affects the politics as far as far by the self-caused economic crisis itself. the power of the corporations is increasing, increasing economic demand and the managing director of the corporations are to be changed, the cash of their company.</seg>
<seg id="948">"" "the more successful capitalism," "" "demos" "" "[the people] from democracy, the higher will become the twin summit, and the excess of human labour power and prosperity of humanity." ""</seg>
<seg id="949">"" "" "" "if this is true, we have to bring back the politics and the economy, and it would be better if the" "" "demos" "" "control, apart from the exclusion of the servants, the women and the foreigners." ""</seg>
<seg id="950">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist Linke had this idea already 100 years ago and it was not very strange.</seg>
<seg id="952">The doctrine of the Soviet Union should be that the working arms should only recover a position as in ancient Athens without creating new types of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: creating the working arms!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it, replacing low-wages, replaced by automation and robot.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is, so long-economy and politics can be higher, the automation makes the twin summit, and the social conflicts has deeper, as it's very soon as I believe -- in countries like China.</seg>
<seg id="956">"" "" "" "we have to revise the economy and the fields of economy and politics again, in order to democrats the reunified field of surveillance, otherwise we will show the movie" "" "matrix" "" "as a documentary." ""</seg>
<seg id="957">"" "" "" "the question is not whether capitalism has brought the technical achievements, which he has to survive." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="958">"" "the most interesting question is whether capitalism, through a dystopia, similar to" "" "Star Trek" "" "is similar to that the society in the research of the universe, or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians" "" "Agora," "" "in long talks to the meaning of life." ""</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">"" "what do it so, how could it look like this" "" "Star Trek" "" "instead of the" "" "matrix" "" "like Dystopia?" ""</seg>
<seg id="961">In the practical implementation I would like to give you a few examples.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the area of the company: imagine a capital market before you earn money, while you work and in which your capital you have to help you from a company to the next, and the company -- no matter what you're working -- is the property of them that currently work in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all income from capital and proceeds from Ermites and the concept of wage work is completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="964">No distinction between those who belong to the company, but they are not working there, but employees work where the company does not belong to which the company does not include any large gaps between investment and spelt, and ultimately does not include the twin summit.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the area of global political economy, please contact us that our national currencies would have a free fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, which is issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [group of 20 largest emerging markets], in the interest of whole humanity is issued.</seg>
<seg id="966">"" "imagine that the world trade will be traded in this currency --" "" "we call them" "" "Kosmos" "" "in units of" Kosmos "" "" in units of "Kosmos" "" "and every government is equivalent to the trade surplus of the country, in a joint fund." ""</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that the fund has invested in "green" technologies, especially in parts of the world, in which investment funds are rar.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is no new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes had suggested in the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that one did not implement the technical resources at that time.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today we have, in particular, in particular, in particular, in front of a recovered policy and economy.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world, which I describe you, is at the same time liberates, in which they privileged persons, and maristically, because they buried the separation of capital and work in the trashless of history, and keynesional, global keynesiology.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all others, it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Become we awakening in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">"" "or become a" "" "matrix" "" "- similar dystopia sinking?" ""</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on it, how we decide together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands, and we do it better.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>

<seg id="984">Through the transfer of this crisis of a part of the earth to the next, as we experience it, it will not only destabilize our democracy, but also the countries whose interest in liberally democracy is low.</seg>

<seg id="1038">By Roy Price, most of them have never heard yet, although it is responsible for 22-40 minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision to hit the Roy three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is senior employee at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">He is 47 years old, slim, has a yellowish and describes Twitter as "movies, TV, technique, Tacos."</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for the shows and content that will produce Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course, this is a very hard fighting sector.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are already so many TV-series that Roy may not select anything.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He must find shows that very well, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he must find shows that are located right on this curve.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the evaluation process of over 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the evaluation is from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this review will receive.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is rated 9 times higher, this winner is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then one has a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"" "these are shows how" Breaking Bad "" "," The Wire "" "," The Wire "" "" -- all the shows that addictive, where, after you have a season, your brain asks: "" "" where are more of this episodes? "" "</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">On the left side, here at this end, shows shows how "Toddlers and Tiaras" -- -- that should say you enough to say that at that end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price does not work on the left side of the turn, because I think you need special intelligence to offer "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">He makes more thoughts about the middle breakage, the average television -- the shows that neither good nor bad, they are simply inspiring.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So, he must make sure that it is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is available, and of course it is the first time that Amazon is so something that Roy wants to risk nothing.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs a guaranteed success, so he keeps a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes many ideas for TV shows and chooses eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and presents them online, where they can view every free.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And when Amazon gives out free things, you feel right, right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of people look forward to this episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they don't know that they will be observed during the shows of this shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are observed by Roy and his team, all of them.</seg>
<seg id="1066">They record when you start the show when you're pauded, which parts you jumps and check again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">You will collect millions of data to decide with these data, which show you should produce them.</seg>
<seg id="1068">In fact, they collect the data, and this makes the answer, and this is: "Amazon should make a Sitcom over four republican U.S. transitions."</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anyone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">Yes, "Alpha House," but it seems that not many of them can remember that show because it was not so good.</seg>
<seg id="1072">It is only an average show -- in the trusts of the word -- since the average of this curve 7.4 amounts and alpha House landet at 7.5 -- thus something about the average, but not just what to be Roy and his team.</seg>
<seg id="1073">About the same time with another company, another manager has a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for program design of Netflix. just like Roy is always on the search to find these a super show and he uses data for it, but he makes it something different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of a contest, he and his team got the existing data on the Netflix audience, thus the reviews they give the shows, which shows the shows, which shows them etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they utilize these data to find these little details about the spectators: what shows they like, which actors, which actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the parts together they went a car, and decided to do not a Sitcom over four transmitters, but a drama series about an Senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards." Netflix has hit a hit, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" obtains a 9,1 review on this curve. so exactly there where they wanted.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course, is the question: what happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">One has two very competent, data reversible firms.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They combine these many data and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">Why this is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic had somehow besought that that should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If you collect millions of data, for a decision which you meet, then you should make a good choice.</seg>
<seg id="1086">It has 200 years to statistics as a back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">We optimizes it through very powerful computer.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The least what you can expect is good television, or?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis does not work so, this is somewhat scaffingly, because we live in a time, in which we have more and more to statistics, in order to meet serious decisions, far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Someone knows someone here the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">Nobody. OK, that's even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room come in contact with this software. come in contact, you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone asks here in the United States and to ask the release, it is likely to determine whether the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dismissal is carried out or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like on Amazon and Netflix. but rather than decide whether a show is good or bad, it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Medium television, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but still more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that these data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results. this is not aware that a company like Multi-Health Systems do not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">There are also the most diversified companies lie wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google has sometimes error.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009, Google announced that it can anticipate data analysis of flu, the worst species, predicts -- by data analysis of the Google research.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked miracultured and was a great news station. the success was successful in a publication in the magazine "Nature" magazine.</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked perfectly, year by year, until it suddenly did not work anymore,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"" "it just didn't work, this was once again a sensation, including the revocation of the publication" "" "Nature" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the datasterest companies such as Amazon and Google are sometimes misunderstood.</seg>
<seg id="1106">Despite all these mistakes, data have been involved in the decisions of life a -- on the workplace, at the end of the law, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So, we should make sure that data are helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-assisted genetics -- an area where some very smart people can use unimaginable many data to make serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years, I recognized a few patterns on the difference between successful decisions using data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be disseminated.</seg>
<seg id="1110">Ever, you have to solve a complex problem, do they mainly do two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">As First breakdown the problem in its parts, so that you can analyse the individual parts; as a rate, you set the individual parts again to hold a conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: apart and set up again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to disassemble and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to assemble the parts and then come to an end.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool and we all have it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there's something, when the brain is good, it is parts and pieces again, even if the information is uncomplete, in order to hold a good conclusion -- especially when the brain is an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Therefore, I believe that Netflix was so successful because they have data and understanding, where they also belong to the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">You can use the data to understand their audience, for why they would not have been able to assemble all these parts, but the decision how to make all these parts, and there is no show how "House of Cards" does not stand in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show, which meant that they entered a personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon, on the other hand, on the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used to control all their decisions, first as they chose TV ideas as they voted "Alpha House" as a show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"" "it was a safe decision because they could always say," "" "that the data say us." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data are helpful to better choices, but I believe that things are wrong when data start to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">Regardless of how powerful they are, data are only one tool, and in order to forget that this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before it was data, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It is also called "Magic 8 Ball." it's amazing. for decisions by a Jaime or No-Question you must only shake the ball to get a reply. "highly likely" -- exactly here in this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I'm going to be re-true later with a technology demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">I have met some decisions in my life, whereby I should listen to the ball in the afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you are of course, if you have the data available, you would like to replace them through something much leverage, such data analysis to make better choices.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the foundations.</seg>
<seg id="1135">For example, the ball will be clashed and kling. finally, it's to meet decisions if we want to achieve something exceptional at the end of the right curve.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I perceive this as a very encouraging message that despite the great amount of data is still paying attention to make decisions, an expert in which you do, and risks to enter the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">"" "" "" "for at the end there is not the data, but the risks that you have at the right end of the curve." ""</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thanks beautiful.</seg>
